#########################

This is our read.txt file and we will explain the structure of our code package here.
There are several folders in this package.
(Ordered by functionality and process, not by alphabetical order here)


1. datasets:

- Amazon_combined_data_with_Sentiment_Score
  This is the folder with sorted Amazon review data of 7 categories, each one with 100 products.
  There are total number of 15720 entries with sentiment value assigned here.
  Generated by the script in scripts/samples_data_script.sh
  Since the original raw dataset of Amazon and Walmart is very large (4-7GB),
  we think it is better to show the sorted Amazon data as an example here.

- db_backup_20191102.sql:
  This .sql file include all sorted data for both Amazon and Walmart from the mysql database.
  It is a completely dump of all the tables here.

2. urls

- other_urls.txt:
  These are the urls for our raw dataset of Amazon, our code repository, and the VADER Sentiment Analysis repo.

- walmart_scraper_urls.txt:
  This file include all the links we feed to the walmart scraper to collect walmart review data.

###############################################################################################

3. scripts (usage details are written inside the scripts):

- samples_data_script.sh:
  This script is used to sort and collect test data from the raw dataset we initially have.
  The range is 7 categories and 100 products for each, then collect all the entries within it.

- vaderSentiment_code-20191031T174327Z-001.zip
  This archive includes the environment and scripts to calculate the sentiment values with VADER.
  It will go through the output of samples_data_script.sh and assign values based on review texts.

- sql_converter.py:
  Using the output from the VADER script, it sorted the data insert them into the mysql database.

- query_scripts/*.txt
  These are the sample data we used to calculate a sentimentScore based on sentimentValue.
  The conversion for rating 1 2 3 4 5 is -1.0 ~ -0.6 | -0.6 ~ -0.2 | -0.2 ~ 0.2 | 0.2 ~ 0.6 | 0.6 ~ 1.0.

- query_scripts/sentScore_updatedb.sh
  This script is used to calculate the sentimentScore then update the entries back to mysql database.

- query_scripts/calculate_mean.sh
  This script is to calculate the mean for the ratings.

- query_scripts/*_ratio_amount.sh
  These scripts are used to calculate the amount of ratings / sentimentScore of total / each category.
  They can also be used to calculate the ratio.

- query_scripts/rating_sentScore_matrix.sh

  The outputs include total amount, ratios, means, matrix comparions and more.

- Data Analysis * graphs.xlsx
  These excel sheets are the graphs we generated from the data output we have above.
