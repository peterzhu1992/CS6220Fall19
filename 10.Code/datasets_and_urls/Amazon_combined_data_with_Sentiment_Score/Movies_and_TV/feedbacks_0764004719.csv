0,A26XPNBICXR6QL,764004719,J. Williams,"[34, 35]","After watching the series on PBS, I was not sure if I would like the sudden switch of characters, but I was pleasantly surprised. I found that the acting was perfectly done and the emotions and struggles experienced by the characters were captivating. Immediately, I was drawn in to the story as the actors unveiled the identities of the characters I had come to know and understand through reading the Herriot stories.",5,Breathtaking!!!,968803200,"09 13, 2000",0.3927

Thanks!Being a die hard James Herriot fan, I had to watch this movie. I have to say that I watched it to the end, but was pretty underwhelmed. My husband lost interest and escaped to his study about two thirds of the way through.It in does not measure up well to the tone of the books and is decidedly inferior to the television series. The performances were boring, and the script was not as faithful to the spirit of books as I would have liked. Some change is to be expected because of time constraints, but there were changes that were not necessary and didn't make sense nor did they contribute in any way to the retelling of the story - for example, why did James come from London instead of Scotland in this version? Several little things were changed for no apparant reason, while leaving in huge awkward chunks of story that didn't add anything to the whole. The script was herky-jerky with no real storyline, other than a series of incidents set against the backdrop of James and Helen's romance. It seemed that there were needless story changes that did nothing to enhance the movie, while leaving in awkward parts that needed to be pruned to make the story flow in a sensible manner. I didn't understand why the screenplay flowed the way it did.Anthony Hopkins, who is normally a superior actor, is especially disappointing in the role of Siegfried - not at all up to his usual standards. His rendition of this character was dark and looming, with not much of the humor that comes through in the book. After watching this movie, I could understand why Donald Sinclair (the real Siegfried)was so offended that he threatened to sue when he saw how he was being portrayed!I have heard that Lisa Harrow was James Harriot's personal favorite of all the Helens, and I thought she was very fetching in the role. However, there didn't seem to be much chemistry between the two lead actors, and their romance wasn't very believable to me. Simon Ward did nothing for the part of James, and I much preferred Christopher Timothy's James Herriot in the TV series.Brian Stirner was just OK in the part of Tristan.Actors aside, it was the screenplay and direction that left the most to be desired. I just couldn't get past the choppy storyline. One reviewer said that it needed to have a more cohesive plot, and I agree. If you are going to take a whole book and trim it down into a feature film, at least make changes that make sense and contribute to an understandable plot.There is one scene in the movie that was actually better than the series, though - It was where James asks Helen's father if he can marry her. John Collin did a positively wonderful job of playing Mr. Alderson, and because of his sensitive and touching portrayal, made this the best telling of this particular part of the story. It reminded me of Donald Sutherland's scene in PRIDE AND PREDJUDICE where he realizes that Lizzy really loves Mr. Darcy! First rate acting in this scene, and the only reason this movie rates more than one or two stars from me! Truly a standout performance in an otherwise so-so flick.I am glad I saw this movie, if for no other reason than my curiosity has been satisfied, but this will be the one and only time I will watch it, while I go back to the book and the TV series again and again. I may take another peek at John Collin's scene, though!",3,"Mediocre Movie, Not Worthy of James Herriot",1323475200,"12 10, 2011",0.1465
2,AZO85A1JAGBGR,764004719,L. Lewis,"[1, 1]","I absolutely love the James Herriot books but didn't care for the movie at all. Most of what makes the stories so good is his thoughts & reactions to what is going on or what he is seeing. He totally loves the couontryside & describes it beautifully. The movie may pan a shot but if you don't know how he feels about it it doesn't matter. You also don't get to know what he is thinking about the animals, the people or the crazy situations he finds himself in. I was totally disappointed because his books are among my best loved. If you want the true All Creatures Great & Small exoperience, read the books.",1,Doesn't Do the Stories Justice,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",0.3361
3,A2ZPVXVREQ7KRY,764004719,Lydia Diaz Citychick,"[0, 0]","I truly enjoyed this movie adaptation of the Herriott novel. Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite actors, and his performance here does not disappoint. One cannot help but get caught up in the story, the characters, and the beautiful English countryside. I had purchased the DVD for my partner, an avid animal lover, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. If you, too, love animals, this movie is a keeper!",5,Endearing characters and beautiful landscapes,1342310400,"07 15, 2012",0.7372
4,A3PFWHYF3EW7WT,764004719,Michael Anthony Brenton,"[23, 24]","This television movie based on the best selling autobiography of country veterinarian James Herriot came before the popular BBC television series. Simon Ward, Anthony Hopkins and Lisa Harrow star in this charming little tale about the new vet who moves a to Yorkshire farming community in the 1930's. Along the way he not only wins his neighbors over but also finds romance. Directed by Claude Whatham, this 1974 film does not have the depth of the television series, but you can clearly see why people would want more of the same on a more regular basis.",5,ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL!,1005177600,"11 8, 2001",0.6683

I liked it as being a realistic film about the life of a British country vet in pre-WWII Great Britain.The acting is first rate and the script is well done.I think that the novel may have been just as goodto have been so well represented here.,4,"Dogs, hogs, horses and cows",1235433600,"02 24, 2009",0.4596

Riis rriis,"[37, 39]","To criticize this delightful film by comparing it to the beloved television series is fairly silly, since the series had the time and scope to flesh out the characters and allow them to develop in a way a single film cannot. The film version, admittedly compressing a leisurely and anecdotal book into a two-hour overview, nevertheless does a terrific job of capturing the pace and character of these amiable vets and their clients and the scenic Yorkshire countryside that made the books so appealing. The cast is altogether excellent. The television series, which comes out on DVD in May 2002, is not to be missed. This film is likewise pleasurable viewing.",5,A pleasurable film in its own right,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",0.5202
