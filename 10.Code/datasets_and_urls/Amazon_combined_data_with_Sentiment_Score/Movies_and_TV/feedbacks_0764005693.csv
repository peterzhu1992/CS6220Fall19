0,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,764005693,Aaron Von Raschke,"[0, 0]","TENEBRE is genre film directed by Horror icon Dario Argento about a serial killer who is inspired by a murder mystery book called Tenebrae. When the book's author visits Italy, the killer makes his presence known by slashing women to death with a straight razor. Eventually the police get involved (if there was a list of all time 'Films With the Worst Cops Ever', TENEBRE would be high on that list) and the book's author even tries to take matters into his own hands. At the film's conclusion a twist is revealed that comes off like Stephen King meets Scooby Doo.At the time this movie was released, director Dario Argento was known for his supernatural films like SUSPIRIA and INFERNO, however TENEBRE is a straight-forward whodunit, faceless killer, murder mystery. It's a timeless movie that, despite its flaws, is stylish in the way that it's shot and presented as an overall film. The film boasts an awesome soundtrack provided by his usual music collaborators, consisting of random members of the band Goblin. The movie's theme song is also sampled by the Indie Rock/Electronic band Justice on theirCROSSalbum for the songs Phantom and Phantom, pt. II. While the movie is pretty solid, it does have some laughable dialogue and overdubs. The movie was filmed in English but still overdubbed nonetheless. The best line of the movie is when the book's author's assitant Anne offers a Police Officer some alcohol and then says I'm sorry you probably don't drink on duty, to which the cop replies I ONLY drink on duty. Wow.Overall, TENEBRE is an awesome movie. It has moments of suspense, moments of creepyness, moments that will sneak up and scare the piss out of you, obligatory nudity, great yet sometimes ridiculous acting, an awesome and gory climax, great music, an overdramatic lesbian lovers spat, cops that drink on duty, ax murders, a young John Saxon (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET)... need I say more? Also, the Anchor Bay release of this DVD has outstanding sound and video quality. Highly recommended.4 stars",4,A crucial Giallo flick.,1229731200,"12 20, 2008",0.0783
1,A1WXCMB52BON8N,764005693,A Customer,"[1, 2]","Hard to write a review of this without giving the plot away, as this classic giallo is essentially a whodunnit, the 'solution' even reminding of a certain Agatha Christie book (I won't say which).Argento tries hard to unsettle, from the giddying opening bike ride along a bridge onwards. There is always the implied presence of a hidden watcher - far more subtle and effective than in Hollywood.Subsequent scenes take place in the bright, seemingly normal world of Rome shops, but even here a sinister presence lurks. A shoplifting scene heightens the tension, as well as establishing a certain sardonic comedic element. Rome, so stylish and fashionable, is far from safe. It is filled with lechers, thieves, rapists...and murderers. The brightness (even in night scenes) contrasts with the film's name 'Tenebrae'. But in some scenes the lighting is simply eerie (the dog attack in the park).Jerky changes in soundtrack volume add to the tension (and the music is suitably weird, though not as good as 'Suspiria' in this regard). Many other odd details create a sense of the non-ordinary.In short, a very good giallo film from this Italian master.",3,A few things you should know about 'Tenebre',1259798400,"12 3, 2009",-0.0571

To my opinion this two movies along with Profondo Rosso (Deep Red) are the best giallo films in history of cinema although there are many great flicks and filmmakers who worked in this direction. With all my love and respect towards Lucio Fulci, Luigi Cozzi, Sergio Martino, Umberto Lenzi, Ruggero Deodato and so on, I still think Argento's movies are way better than any others.In Tenebrae you still have all the necessary attributes of the genre - pretty girls being murdered, killer in black gloves, a sympathetic detective investigating a case, but the film stands out among all others of this kind. I don't even know how to explain it, but Argento knows how to create images that will haunt your memory forever after entering it. Dead girl's head hanging over at the staircase, murder on a crowded square, dog persuit, the unforgettable finale - these are the scenes you will hardly forget ever. They will still be in your head after many years, like remains of some blurry dream, and you'll be wondering: Did I see it in some of Argento films?. And you'll definately want to watch it once more.I know all his movies by heart, but I still can't understand what it is that makes them so special, how Argento manages to create this miraculous and dreamy atmosphere. Maybe we're dealing with some kind of divine intervention here.About edition itself: Anchor Bay release is slightly cut, just a couple of seconds, couple of stabs :) If you really want a totally uncut version try to find either Dutch edition by A-Film (titled Shadows), or French one by TF1 Video, or any existing Japanise version. All others have these few seconds cut. But on the other hand Anchor Bay has some good extras, so you may want to have more than one edition if you are a real fan.

Here Argento demonstrates visible mastery in delivering a good suspense following the best &quot;Hitchcock&quot; style,adding to this his own personal visions and ideas, like his great and daring camera movements and the blood baths so common in his horror pictures.Good acting by the cast,especially from the always reliable John Saxon and Anthony Franciosa.The story,a kind of mix between &quot;Psycho&quot; and the stalking-serial-killer theme,is developed to perfection by the director,who finally is able to create a picture with heart.I say that because Tenebre has a believable story (about a novelist writer who is stalked by a serial killer while promoting his last book, called 'Tenebre') and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats guessing, and differently from other Argento's films(namelly his horror movies) Tenebre is well-written and doesn't rely only in style or camera tricks. I'm an admirer of Mr. Argento, but unfortunatelly I believe that his most famous pictures could have been a lot better than they actually are if their scripts were revised at least once by a good writer.

7,AE0E6UII0VSZA,764005693,Blake Kleiner,"[3, 3]","Dubbed the Italian Hitchcock by his American fans, Dario Argento is one of those filmmakers who is completely uninhibited with his use of the camera and gore effects. He sets himself apart from other filmmakers by setting himself free upon the world he creates and showing it to us in the greatest possible detail. His camera movements are always purposeful and stunning, and he always adds the right amount of lighting and atmospheric music to make up for the poor post-sync dubbing. (Sometimes watching an Argento movie is to relive the best follies of the Godzilla films as you watch people's mouths move totally out of place from the dialogue.)Tenebre is one of those movies that stays under your skin for long after you've watched it. It has a tense plot, decent acting, and a climax of such shocking violence that we're left with the image of blood spraying a grotesque mural on a wall burned into our brains. Argento's darkest side gets unleashed in this film. His creativity was obviously at the top if its form when he thought of the camera move that scales the entire exterior of a house up to the top floor, moving into a close up on the roofing tiles, and then back out to a medium shot on an intended victim standing in a window. This shot creates a great deal of tension, even with the bad music playing in the background. (The DVD shows a behind the scenes featurette about the creation of this one memorable shot.)The plot of the film is too ridiculously simple to take a long time to explain. In fact, other films have used it since then. Basic Instinct, for example, is about a serial killer who murders her victims in the same fashion as is written in novels by her favorite author. Tenebre came out before Basic Instinct, and has almost exactly the same plot, minus the gratuitous sex scenes and lesbianism. I wonder if Ezterhas was an Argento fan. Doesn't matter. Argento's film buries Basic Instinct with a style Paul Verhoeven can't hope to match. It rises above most of Argento's other films as a classic of the pulp horror genre.

Argento's virtuso filmmaking technique is used to great effect in this film, creating genuinely sinister and suspenseful atmosphere, with amazing, sometimes jaw-dropping camerawork, brutal but elegantly staged murders, and all in the service of a very clever and well-plotted mystery from Argento that kept me guessing right up until the end.The music score by members of long-time Argento collaborators The Goblins is used very effectively, and Anthony Francisosa gives a fine performance in the lead, as an American writer in Rome, who becomes personally involved when the murders in his lastest novel start coming true.Anchor Bay has done a superb job with this release; if you are still buying VHS like me, this is about as good as it gets.

Neal must partner with the police and follow a trail of intricately-placed clues in order to unmask his obsessed fan. Dario Argento's TENEBRAE is an iconic film amongst Giallo enthusiasts, pushing each of the defining characteristics of the genre to their extremes! It includes everything the Italian film fan has come to love: a sadistic black-gloved killer, psycho-sexual themes, incomprehensible twists, and a series of exotic deaths. In spite of its convoluted plotting and lapses in logic, this brilliantly-crafted suspense thriller still manages to utterly shock and surprise audiences. The stylish murder sequences are as brutal and bloody as they are beautifully shot. Nothing is ever ugly in an Argento film, and even death is portrayed as a macabre masterpiece! TENEBRAE also includes one of the director's most complicated, impressive, and completely unnecessary crane shots that takes the viewer in, up, and around an entire two-story building to find a woman under attack on the other side. The exhilarating electric stylings of Italian rock group Goblin add an additional level of excitement and suspense to the high-powered murders found throughout the film.

11,A33RDFYADJUYJQ,764005693,C. Clark,"[3, 3]","In his long and illustrious career, Dario Argento has focused on two subgenres of the horror film: the supernatural thriller and the giallo. For his best supernatural thriller, see Suspiria. For his best giallo, see Tenebrae.I found Tenebrae to be much more enjoyable than Deep Red, the 1975 pic most people consider to be Argento's best. Tenebrae has few of the gaps in pacing evidenced by Deep Red's unedited bilingual version, and it also has an arguably more likeable lead--Anthony Franciosa playing Peter Neal, a successful American author on a book tour in Rome, a man who suddenly finds himself at the epicenter of a series of kinky murders committed by a fan apparently obsessed with Neal's most recent bestseller (Tenebrae, which means darkness in Italian.)So many faces familiar to Eurohorror pop up here: Daria Nicolodi as Neal's assistant who may or may not survive the bloodbath; John Steiner (also in Bava's Shock and the infamous Caligula) making a bow as a nosy book reviewer; John Saxon as the cynical literary agent; Ania Pieroni, she of the gorgeous eyes and killer body, getting killed for being a promiscuous shoplifter. These engaging actors are thrown into a film filled with sexual tension, mystery...and murder. Lots of murder. The body count here is lower than, say, a Halloween or Jason movie, but the killings themselves are so memorable and done in such an artistic way--such an Argento way--that they instantly make one's top ten list.It goes without saying that Argento's camera gymnastics are amazing here, including a two-minute louma crane shot covering the entire exterior of a building. If there are any drawbacks, it's that the color is rather washed out; most interiors are white on white, and as one critic once said, Even the nighttime scenes are bright. If one is looking for Bava-inspired Argento colorization, watch Suspiria or the underrated Inferno instead.In summary, Tenebrae is a must-own for all serious giallo fans.",5,Arguably Argento's best,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",-0.0274

The plot is deliberately - perhaps deceptively - simple; an American horror novellist arrives in Italy to promote his new book, but a series of homicides begin which seem to imitate the murders in his book. I wouldn't dream of giving away the ending but trust me - it's worth waiting for. While it doesn't quite have the visual beauty of Suspiria, or enough twists or interesting characters to put it in the leages of Deep Red or Bird with the Crystal Plumage, this film is far from his worst and worth buying if only for the marvellous presentation - a rare commentary from Argento and Simonetti and some other guy (a journalist I think), behind the scenes footage (quite short and lifted from Dario Argento's world of Horror, but a welcome addition nevertheless). Oh yes, and did I mention, it also contains the highest body count of any Argento film - and probably the bloodiest death (listen to Argento's commentary at this point - 'she's an artist, eh?. . .

That menace takes the form of a serial killer making fiction-into-fact of Peter Neal's latest novel. Argento seems to be in a let-it-all-hang-out mood here (but when isn't he?); the thickly decadent Eurodisco soundtrack that accompanies these lovingly-staged slaughters seems designed to inhance any charges of turning murder into voyeuristic spectacle. The killings that immediately follow on the heels of that bizarre dream-sequence bear this out: they're a sex-and-death orgy that takes the horror genre into Baudelaire. But the richest and most elaborate sequence of all concerns the hotel owner's nubile daughter, who gets stranded in some very sticky circumstances in the middle of the night in Rome.

His murders have an artsy quality to them, more like paintings then gory executions. He is the most backwards example of a horror director there has ever been. Yet he manages to draw out a primal reaction from his viewers with ever film he makes. 'Tenebre' takes us to Rome, where we meet a talented novelist who is being stalked by a relentless murderer who is drawing inspiration from the writer's novels themselves. Argento's trademark operatic styling comes into full swing during the second half of the film, starting with a long 3 minute tracking shot which scours over the rooftops and down the walls of a house where two young women will eventually be murderer. The infamous 'paint-the-wall red' scene would be entirely laughable if Argento didn't place it in the most serene of settings.

I even like their mediocre movies. But mediocre this is not! Amazingly, this is the very first Dario Argento film that I've seen. I was going to dive into Susperia but was warned away by advice from my friends the experts. So I backed off and went for this; a simple little slasher film. Jeez, I can be misleading!!This isn't complicated, but it's certainly not simple either. I know, I know; Just shut up and get to the point EK!!-A VIRGIN TAKE ON DARIO ARGENTO.What can you say about a guy who will shoot film of his own daughter in the nude? You can say ALLRIGHT!! that's what. Though I would never do it (and not just because I'd get arrested), this guy has few standards when it comes to nudity and gore other than more please. In the 1980's this was gold for horror fans. It doesn't play too badly today either. Besides those obvious deviant traits, Argento is a bold and creative visionary. You can almost see his brain working as he tries to come up with a really creative way to shoot a scene. Sometimes it looks pretentious. The rest of the time it's bloody brilliant. Not every shot is creative, but in the right situation; lookout!!! Argento's story telling is a bit clumsy at times but he definitely had some tricks up his sleeves for Tenebre. I'm not sure if I made an accurate assessment watching just one film but that's my take for now.-IT AINT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER, AND OVER, AND OVER...If you've read the synopsis of Tenebre (and you should, because I'm not going to tell you), you'd know this is about a serial killer stalking an author of the titular book while reenacting the murders contained within. I know I've seen this before, but I'm not sure where. Regardless, it's a plot device Argento has some fun with. This mystery is a real puzzler and I would have never guessed it. However, when the mystery is solved, the murders continue. Now, up to this point, I had no clue who the killer was. But as soon as the suspect is revealed, I immediately unraveled the second mystery. Yea, there's a second mystery and the movie is really only half over. The great thing is, now we get more murders and some real mass carnage! Even though I solved the second mystery as soon as it presented itself, not only was I actually surprised by the ending but I WAS COMPLETELY SUCKERED!!!-ITALIAN DUBBED. ITALIAN FUNNY!It's really kind (and financially wise) of Italian film makers in general, to do these films in English. Even American actors have their voice dubbed on occasion if something didn't turn out right. They happen to be pretty good at this and it never was a distraction. In fact, as brutally goofy as some of the dialogue was in Tenebre other parts were uproariously witty. My favorite dialogue was between the author, Mr. Neal and the police detective. I'm not going to quote anything here; that would spoil the fun. But I highly recommend you look out for these conversations because they are amongst the best in any horror film. This detective would put Columbo to shame (despite amazon's review)!-CARNAGE. OVER THE TOP WE GO!!!Oh yea, this carnage is way over the top!!! It's absolutely beautiful. I think I'm going to weep (sniff). Seriously, besides one of the coolest dog chase scenes you'd care to see, we get a bushel of throat slashing, a peck of head splitting, a liter of impalement, a gallon of spine splitting and a quart of good old fashioned stabbing. Throw in a pinch of dismemberment with fountains of blood and I think over the top is where we end up. But carnage in itself is not a beautiful thing. It's a delicate art form. You need to set the mood. To achieve this end, Argento kindly plays Goblin music just before every murder; how 80s cool is that! Though not quite the theme from Jaws, it sure helped me ratchet up my expectations and excitement when I heard it. If you have only a mild tolerance for gore, you'll be ok. This stuff never looks real which is why I thought it was so much fun.-ITALIAN WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL TOO.So, what more do you want me to say? All right, I should say something. One thing I learned from this film about women in Italy, Rome in particular, is that they never wear bras. In fact, they have a hard time covering the parts that matter most of the time. Even when the try to cover things, they just end up uncovered again. I've never seen such slippery women. The funniest part of all is when Argento basically admits he's a sexist pig during one scene in this movie; a badge he seems to wear with pride. Just try to get me to complain about it!-THIS IS NO MYSTERY AT ALL.If I made this film sound too goofy, I must apologize. It really is played straight with great characters and a well paced story. The actors all do an above average job. What makes it so fun is the audacity of it all. Argento is about as bold as they come when it come to creativity with a camera, gore and nudity. I'd never call the guy a master cinematographer, but he gets huge points for pushing the envelope. Though I make light of it, the story is actually well thought out and cleverly pulls a fast one (or two) on the viewer.

Valero Eterno,"[0, 0]","When Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa), a popular horror novelist visits Rome to promote his latest best-seller Tenebrae, he is suddenly thrust into a world of murder and mayhem when a psychopath goes on a killing spree and uses techniques described in his book. The killer seems to be on a mission, killing off people (mostly women) who are morally corrupt and are referred to by the killer as deviants.This blood-soaked, fast-moving Argento flick is not in the same classic level as his masterpiece Suspiria or even Deep Red but his fans seem to love it regardless. The film is not really a horror film but a sexually charged detective thriller with an attractive cast, solid acting (although some of the dubbing is pretty annoying), creative camera angles (typical in an Argento film) and lot's of blood (again, typical of an Argento film). Like Argento's other work, this film is visually stunning. The entire cast is made up of photogenic, elegant actors; Daria Nicolodi, Mirella D'Angelo, Anthony Franciosa, John Saxon, Ania Pieroni and a whole array of exotic European beauties. Argento also uses the color red effectively throughout this film; bright red lipstick, red stilettos, red cars, countless scenes of gleaming red blood. It takes someone like Dario Argento to make blood look so beautiful on screen.This film was released in North America in a heavily edited form and under the insane title of Unsane. I've never seen the edited version but apparently many scenes were cut in order for the film to get an R rating. Tenebrae may be violent but the violence itself is no more shocking then the numerous slasher films released from Hollywood throughout the decade so it's a mystery to me as to why this film was given this kind of treatment. It's a shame because not many people have been able to see this in its unedited form until it's DVD release.Tenebrae boasts a strong cast, a great score (maybe a bit outdated but it's awesome nonetheless), a good story, and a great twist finale. Like Dario's other film's; Deep Red, Opera, Phenomena, Inferno and the enigmatic Suspiria, Tenebrae is eerily suspenseful, looks splendid and is a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection.

OK story once again, I've become burnt out on Argento and realized he is a hack, it is mostly due to his better choices in collaborating with talented cinematographers that granted him success. If you observe his collaborations with film editors and cinematographers you can see where the real talent lies within his works. Most visual style must be given credit to his cinematographers and editors. Argento's stories and cheap use of gore is all that's left. Perhaps some of the visual staging might be his ideas?

24,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,764005693,General Zombie,"[0, 2]","I don't seem to hold Tenebre in quite as high esteem as most Argento fans appear to, but this is still a fine, highly entertaining film. While not as strong visually as the his 2 supernatural horror films just prior to this, or the following film Opera, it has easily the most satisfying plot of the 5 Argento films I've seen(Deep Red thru Opera, excepting Phenomena), and still has strong murder sequences, enjoyable music, and quite a fair bit of style in general. Thus, it is definitely worth a look.The plot involves an American writer, Peter Neale, on a trip to Rome who becomes involved in a murder investigation when a victim is found with the pages of his latest book stuffed down her throat. Naturally the killer is obsessed with Peter, so he is both a potential victim and a potentially of great help in the investigation. This isn't the most original or exciting set up you're gonna hear, but as with all the other Argento films I've seen, the plot isn't really what matter. However, I will say that the major revelation of the film is actually fairly satisfying, and, well, cool. It is perhaps not the most likely thing in the world, but it's close enough. Some have complained that the plot is too reliant on coincidence and contrivance. Frankly, this doesn't bother me, though one scene does is a bit too unlikely.(A character is attacked by a dog, which chases her until she takes refuge in the killer's house (!)) This would bother more me, but this happening isn't utterly necessary for the continuance of the plot, so I'll forgive them. The acting is acceptable, but not remarkable. Anthony Franciosa is a bit on the bland side as the lead, but this is a fairly reasonable portrayl. John Saxon and Daria Nicolodi also give some fairly good performances, but everyone else is pretty blah. John Saxon provides the small bit of humor in the film, most of it involving his new hat. A new hat may not seem like a comedy goldmine, but it's actually kinda amusing.The lighting and set-design is probably the most conventional of the Argento films I've seen. Here Argento uses an odd tactic that doesn't quite work: He has pretty much the entire film be extremely bright. Much of the time this just looks odd, particularly when you have outdoor nights cenes which are perfectly well-lit and bright. Not a huge problem, but it is bit odd. There's still some great camera work, however. There are lots of great, slow prowling shots of the killer's lair and his handiwork and so on. The much famed scene of the where the camera crawls up one side of an apartment building, viewing the seen to be victims, and coming down the other side to show the killer entering a window is quite cool. (though not as exciting as most people make it out to be) I'm more fond of the close-up of the killer cutting thru the light bulb, the distant over head shots from inside his/her house, and one shot used just prior to the final murder which I don`t wish to spoil. The murder scenes are generally good, sometimes excellent. The first one is the best. The misdirection used may seem obvious in retrospect but it works at the time, and the way they shoot the deathblow is just great. (It shows a close-up of the victim with half of her head taking up the left half of the screen , cuts to a shot of the razor extended and shows it slice out of the frame, cuts to a bloody piece of paper falling out of her mouth, cuts backs to the original shot, as her face slowly falls to her left. I don't know how that sounds on paper, but trust me, it's great.) Argento has a reputation for using extreme violence, which is sort of deserved and sort of not deserved. Other than the much famed arm-stump-spewing-blood-all-over-the-wall-scene and the killer's death, nothing here is really that bloody, though it's all very brutal and harsh, and the camera rarely shies away from the violence. (And it really starts piling up the bodies by the end. Far moreso than I would've imagined at the start of the film.) Despite the frequent comparisons to slasher films, the death scenes in Tenebre are generally more about the way they are shot and staged than extreme gore or novel method of death. The only scene that doesn't work that well is the first ax murder. The slow perspective shot of the victim running away doesn't work all that well, and the actual blows are far from convincingGoblin, minus their drummer, are back to do the soundtrack again., and it's got another synth-jazz-rock with some more ambient stuff thrown in. Although I didn't care for it all the first time around, and it is rather dated in many ways, I've grown to really like the soundtrack. The more atmospheric stuff is best, though I've grown to like the peppier jazzier stuff too. (Though it sometimes seems a bit too light hearted for the scene)Well, that's it. If you haven't seen any Argento films you should see Suspiria first, simply because it is the best that I've seen. And if you haven't seen any of his giallo films Deep Red might be a better start, as it is often regarded as the definitive film of the genre. (though I, personally, prefer Opera and Tenebre) If you like those, you should definitely check this out. (Actually if you don't like Suspiria you may want to check the giallo out anyway, as they aren't similar at all, but, ya know, whatever.)",4,More Brutal Giallo from Dario Argento,1096761600,"10 3, 2004",0.0746

I had to endure horrible VHS, pan and scan transfers that were always butchered by the distributors. Dario has had some of the worst experiences with censors, not only here in the US, but in his native Italy and across Europe. Most of the early VHS copies of his work were always cut versions, but despite the mutilations, there was something magnetic and fascinating about Dario's work that came through anyway. It's like when a great actress is in a lousy film, yet you stare at her anyway because she has that magnetic quality that only a few people in the world posess. Dario's work, even in truncated form, has this quality. Luckily, in the 1990's with the advent of laserdisc and DVD, we can finally see his work the way he meant it to be seen.One of the first films I saw by him was Tenebrae. When Tenebrae (which is Latin for Darkness) was released here, it was cut by 10 minutes and retitled Unsane (this is the uncut version). It's not as good as Suspiria, Deep Red, or Inferno, but it's still wonderful and head and shoulders above his later work (which ranges from OK to abysmal). It has some amazing camera work (including a 2 1/2 minute long take from outside an apartment building, which is well known to Argento fans), a great twist in the middle and end of the film, some great gore scenes, and some strange flashbacks that really work well within the context of the film.There's a scene where a girl gets her armed chopped off. In the original version, this scene was cut (no pun intended), and we saw the axe hit the girl's arm, then we saw the girl armless. The original version you actually see the arm cut off. This woman was a really bad actress who was involved with Silvio Bersculoni, the scandal plagued media baron (an Italian Rupert Murdoch) and the on again/off again Italian prime minister. Dario had to use her in the film, but killed her off in gruesome fashion. Just an interesting tidbit that I wanted to share. The film is very bloody, operatic, and has great cinematography.

32,A3FUBUJAIGM87T,764005693,HorrorMan HM,"[0, 0]","Dario Argento's Tenebre is somewhere in between a murder mystery with graphic violence and a horror movie. Clearly, there is an element of horror in this movie with the graphic kills that take place on screen. In fact, the kill scenes in Tenebre are some of the finest that you will run into regardless of genre. However, to characterize Tenebre strictly as a horror movie would not be entirely accurate as it takes more than just graphic kills to be a horror movie. I would call it a suspense-thriller with some elements of horror being clearly evident.Tenebre is about an author who wrote a book named Tenebre which provides details of very graphic images of murder and a killer begins murdering people using the same techniques as in the book verbatim to commit his murders. What ensues is an intricate suspense-thriller with some elements of horror in the mold of a who dunnit like murder mystery. As the story develops, the author begins his own investigation of these crimes, and so the story unfolds.Fundamentalists may argue that Tenebre does fit the mold of a slasher movie and while this is technically accurate, I would argue that this movie, as a whole, lacks the feel of a horror movie and is more of a mystery and suspense flick. Sure, this movie has some incredibly violent and graphic kills, but that alone does not make a horror movie, and certainly not a scary movie. However, what Argento does provide in Tenebre is a very good and intricate murder mystery with some slasher-movie like kills.The savvy viewer will notice that most of Argento's use of blood and gore and the death scenes in general in all of his movies are largely incidental to the real horror of the story and atmosphere of the movie itself. Unlike many of today's directors and their modern horror movies, Argento always succeeds as using blood and gore as an incidental mechanism to increase horror in the audience, and not as his only means of producing horror. In other words, Argento does not use blood and gore as his only vehicle to create horror, but it is the setting, suspense, the situation, the story and the horrifying atmosphere that Argento employs that are actually scary. Consequently, the killing in and of itself is scarier than it would be without the dreamlike atmosphere and tension build up that Argento uses to effectuate horror. Therefore, when the violence, blood and gore actually occur, there is already a foundation for the horror upon which the kill scenes work to magnify and/or accentuate such horror. That being said, this is where Tenebre is clearly inferior to Argento's earlier works like Suspiria and Inferno where Argento's use of atmosphere is clearly more evident. Still, there are undeniable elements of horror present in Tenebre, but I was just expecting a pure horror movie, and that is not what Tenebre is...it just does not have the requisite feel/atmosphere of a pure horror movie.There is no question that the cinematic atmosphere which is produced by this movie creates great suspense and thrills although not so much in the way of chills. In my mind, Tenebre is definitely much better than Deep Red, but the movies are very similar in style except for a stronger plot development which is clearly evident in Tenebre. There is no doubt that Argento has always been long on style and short on plot development, but that is immaterial regarding its erroneous classification as a pure horror movie. That being said, Argento's horror masterpiece Suspiria and even Inferno are clearly much better in the way of producing pure horror than is Tenebre.I recommend Tenebre if you are looking for a good murder mystery and suspense thriller movie with some very graphic violence and an interesting twist to the ending, but if you are looking for a really good slasher movie or horror flick dealing with similar although not identical subject matter, check out Alfred Hitchcock's immortal classic Psycho, which is clearly cinematic horror at its finest. In a sense, Tenebre is, in a sense, kinda like Psycho with the suspense and graphic kills, but lacking the atmospheric and situational horror of Alfred Hitchcock's classic film.",3,3.75 STARS: A very good suspense-thriller/horror hybrid with impressively graphic kills.,1123459200,"08 8, 2005",-0.5328

It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days more people know about the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a few years in the 1980s and 1990s, Argento drifted away from his tried and true giallo formula, only recently returning to some semblance of form with The Stendhal Syndrome and Sleepless. Tenebrae was Argento's first return to the giallo genre, after he strayed into the supernaturally themed Suspiria and Inferno.I happen to think Tenebrae may well be the best Argento film I have seen, even better than his first wave of gialli. It's the story of Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa), a popular writer of disturbing novels who travels to Italy to promote his latest thriller. Unfortunately for Neal, and more so for several other people, a killer decides to imitate the murders laid out in the author's most recent book. It isn't too long before the local police, in the form of Detective Germani (Giuliano Gemma), make the connection between the homicides and Neal's book. With his assistant Anna (Daria Nicolodi), book agent Bullmer (John Saxon), and a young man named Gianni (Christian Borromeo) standing by his side, the popular novelist soon joins the investigation into these grisly crimes. And grisly they are as only Dario Argento can make them. We see throat slashings, stabbings, a hand liberated from a wrist, and other gooey surprises shot in the sort of alarming, extreme close up that is a trademark of this director's brand of cinematic carnage. Tenebrae constitutes one of Argento's most disturbingly violent escapades into the giallo genre. It is, fortunately, one of his most coherent films as well.Neal continues to promote his book even as he helps the police in the hunt for the killer. He faces a slew of protests about the supposedly misogynistic, ultra violent content of his novels from an angry female protestor and from a smarmy television critic on one of those face-to-face talk shows. Both of Neal's critics perish horribly soon after (surprise, surprise), thus throwing some suspicion on the author himself as a prime suspect. Of course, many others could very well be the ones putting on the black gloves. The only real clue we get from Argento, if you can call it that, is a weird flashback of a young woman tormenting a boy with her red-heeled shoes. As creepy carnival style music plays throughout the flashback, we then see the focus shift to the killer stepping out from behind a hedgerow to stab the woman. What this memory means, and why we see it from the perspective of the killer, soon emerges as Tenebrae draws to its ultra shocking conclusion. And the conclusion is shocking, containing some of the most graphic gore I've seen as well as a truly gasp worthy revelation I won't elaborate on here except to say other films (Nightmares in a Damaged Brain comes to mind) have used it to great effect. Tenebrae is a real treat for the horror fan.Apparently, Tenebrae came about after a crazed fan stalked Dario Argento. Whatever the impetus for making this film, the result is one of the director's most entertaining excursions into the realms of horror. Aside from the graphic gore, we also get the requisite Argento photographic style. Check out that crane shot of the outside of the apartment building, a shot that runs on forever while building the suspense up to a fever pitch. Then there's the great chase scene with the dog, and the murder of the television critic that we see through the windows of his house. Argento truly achieves a masterful vision of mayhem with Tenebrae. The performances, although dubbed in spots, are darn effective too. Franciosa does a great job playing the happy go lucky Peter Neal, and it's always great to see John Saxon in another horror film (even if he does spend a lot of time messing around with that confounded hat!). Tenebrae also ratchets up the suspense by employing yet another mesmerizing synthesizer score from Goblin. The music heard doing those flashback sequences ranks as one of the eeriest bits of music I've ever heard in a horror movie. Yes sir, Tenebrae worked on nearly every level for this genre fan.Dario Argento would go on to make several non-giallo films after Tenebrae (Phenomena starring a young Jennifer Connolly among them) before heading back to his roots again. None of his recent black-gloved nightmare thrillers, however, can match the pounding intensity of this movie. Extras on the DVD include a commentary track, an alternate end credits music piece, and a couple of behind the scenes looks at the film. Less here than on other discs, perhaps, but the movie is so good you won't care. I'm starting to get a little sad since I'm running out of Argento films to watch for the first time. Nonetheless, I now know I can always come back to Tenebrae when I want to see the best Dario Argento has to offer.",5,Phenomenal effort,1095033600,"09 13, 2004",0.0137
37,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,764005693,Jenny J.J.I. A New Yorker,"[1, 1]","I notice that Argento is most often praised for his set pieces, which are usually the suspense/murder sequences. I have to agree I enjoy these very much. He can be very slick. His movie Tenebre is actually fairly well constructed. It is about an American novelist Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) who came to Rome to promote his book only to be mired in the tragic deaths of many beautiful women. Seemingly based on his recent novel the girls (and others) all die horrific deaths with Argento's arsenal of ways to kill pretty Italian girls. Three very memorable scenes in this movie to my mind, and a recurring theme of deep human despair which I have found in his movies so far. Two scenes here which specifically communicate this sense of futility. The first of which involves eight or maybe nine if you go back all the way to the introduction of the minor character involved turns of fate in a lengthy and relentless sequence characteristic of Argento's films and for which I can see why he is sometimes compared to Hitchcock (though is it appropriate to do so???). It is a turning point in the film. I am reminded of the scene with the pile of razor wire in Suspiria. The other scene in Tenebre more graphically identifies that theme in the image of a character impaled on a polished piece of metal, trying to pull it out but his hands are too slippery with blood to grip the object.Stylistically speaking the movie departs from garish and moody lighting of Suspiria for a more frontal, realistic look. If that hallucinogenic quality is the only thing a person liked about those movies. Interestingly enough, people complain that it looks like a TV show and the commentary notes that Argento was looking into the lighting of American television police drama to incorporate into this film. Don't mistake, color is still important. You will notice there is a lot of white so that when someone gets killed.... The other Argento trademarks are here, and effectively so. Camera movement, cutting, and soundtrack are still extremely important. The soundtrack is by three of the members of Goblin and, while of course sounding dated, fits very well, especially in one scene where you hear probably the whole main theme played over the duration of a long elaborate crane shot. I'm still amazed that in a movie where sound is so important I am able to forgive mediocre dubbing.If you ever find yourself trying to argue that Argento isn't a misogynistic film director, make sure you try and sway the conversation away from this film. The vast majority of sick violence is directed at the fairer sex, but never mind! The murders are typically well orchestrated, and it is obvious which part of his film that Argento values the most.

TENEBRE contains some of the most genuinely frightening material in Argento's entire filmography, and some of the best performances too. Anthony Franciosa is quietly convincing in his role as an American writer in Rome, targeted by an obsessive killer who's been modelling a series of murders on scenes from the author's latest book; and the hugely underrated John Saxon provides a memorable turn as Franciosa's shady literary agent (his final scene is a small masterpiece of observation, brilliantly edited).The rest of the cast is less sure-footed, perhaps because these veteran European actors - including Daria Nicolodi and Giuliano Gemma - aren't entirely comfortable performing in English, though the entire cast play second fiddle to the director's bravura execution of the outlandish scenario. Argento takes great delight in toying with the audience's expectations and misdirecting them with clever bits of visual trickery, whilst punctuating the narrative with a series of horrific 'exclamation marks' (such as Veronica Lario dying in a spectacular welter of gore), culminating in a truly shocking finale. What's more, he indulges his trademark eccentricities without obscuring the plot or the characterisations, and the film takes its place alongside DEEP RED (1975) as one of the enduring giallos of the 20th century.

About 20 minutes into the film there's a very haunting flashback that gives me chills every time I see it. It's a beautiful scene.

The story involves... ah, heck with the story it all been done before and maybe better(In my best Argento impression), let's skip to the review(if you want story check out Brian DePalma's Dressed to Kill which this one is a lot like). Tenebre is a slick, stalk and slash, gut 'em murder mistery done with style to burn and flash with a killer music score from Goblin(da da da dung, da na da dung, da na da dung, da da da dung).

The premise is that a famous novelist, Peter Neal (Franciosa) visits Rome on a book tour when murders recreated from his books begin to occur. The police solicit his help in solving the case, but are unprepared for the convoluted web that awaits them.Argento manages to use cutting implements of almost every kind in this film: knives, daggers, axes, hatchets, and even a hokey piece of modern sculpture. The forthcoming sculpture impalement is totally obvious as soon as the audience sees the art in question and where it is located. Sure enough, it plays a key, if ridiculous, role in concluding the film. There are other ludicrous coincidences that require utter suspension of disbelief, especially the attempted dog-attack homicide leading to the victim stumbling in to the murderer's lair, finding evidence for all the killings conveniently displayed on a table, and helping herself. While generally suspenseful, obvious contrivances like these took away one star from my evaluation of the film. The flashback explanation of the murderer's motivation to a childhood incident in Rhode Island also seemed very forced. While it may have tied up a few loose ends of the plot, I didn't find it added much to the story. The other star was lost on technical issues: my copy had very washed out color, while I found the musical score more distracting than anything else.The film does have many good points, and for fans of the genre, it is recommended as a good early example. The direction is very stylish and at some points almost voyeuristic. The acting is much better than most films of this type, with Franciosa turning in a very strong performance (maybe a bit over the top toward the conclusion), and supporting actors turning in good performances as well. John Saxon, for example, has a brief appearance as a publisher, and manages to perfectly capture the greedy zealotry of the trade that Argento was trying to convey.This is a thought-provoking slasher movie that is skillfully crafted and will please fans of the genre; to them I recommend it with no reservations.",3,Dario Argento And Tony Franciosa Create Knife-Wielding Terror,1205539200,"03 15, 2008",0.1081

By this point Argento was so well versed in the sub-genres conventions that TENBRE has an effortless feel about it, the sense that the director was hardly stretching his innumerable talents. The film has a nice allegorical feel in its exploration of the effects of violence in the media on people. In this case it is not a film, but a novel. Argento is clever to divert attention away from the medium of cinema. At the time of the films release just such arguments about violence were reaching an apex, especially in the UK where TENEBRE was actually banned due to its violent content and the influence such imagery might have.From a visual perspective Argento goes to the extreme opposite of his previous two films, by presenting a bright and starkly lit world, this brightness is taken to its extremity when one character played by JOHN SAXON is stabbed to death in broad daylight. The film works well, because of a confusing narrative structure, which is punctuated by flashbacks, which is what one expects from a giallo. If it makes sense, then arguably it has failed. As usual the film is filled with tremendous set pieces, including an astonishing sequence where Argento shoots a house from every conceivable angle in one take. A scene which is disturbing because of the almost omnipotent quality of the gaze of the killer. The Rome location is evocative and surprising in the rather dour and dreary impression it gives.Sadly the broader themes of the film are not dealt with in a particularly intelligent and sensitive way and half way through the film Argento loses patience and begins despatching cast members with clockwork regularity.

Being a huge fan of Goblin, I also own the TENEBRAE soundtrack from King Records and even though Claudio Simonetti left Goblin to pursue a solo career before TENEBRAE's release, the film score is brilliant and is worth the purchase alone.",5,"Come back, Dario!!!!",1015632000,"03 9, 2002",0.1847

Many fans consider this one of his best and I'd agree with that. As I said before, it's a return to giallo, so the plot isn't 100% original, but it has some original ideas put into it. Plus, with the way Argento films his movies, does it really matter what it's all about? Tenebre is an awesome whodunit slasher flick that actually manages to keep you in the dark about the killer's identity. It's also got some of his most stylishly orchestrated murder scenes(you know which one I mean in particular). I've noticed upon repeated viewing that alot of modern so called &quot;horror&quot; films have freely borrowed from this film. That's an old story coz most Italian horror films have had their ideas stolen for modern horror. But, no matter how young and pretty you make the cast or how much you MTV it up for today's AD&amp;D audience, no one can get close to Italy's style. And it's probably impossible to get anywhere near Argento's in particular. This leaves me totally flabbergasted by the rumors of a Suspiria remake! Think about that for a second, will ya-THERE ARE RUMORS THAT SUSPIRIA IS GONNA BE REMADE BY AN AMERICAN STUDIO!!!",5,Argento's On A Roll,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",0.0783

Currently we catch him in Rome, &quot;doing the rounds&quot; to promote his newest work, Tenebre. Unfortunately for Neal, the novel has attracted a certain fan who is a bit more murderously influenced than most. Overall, I was impressed with this work because it operated off of story and not just gore. Tenebrae does have a few gruesome parts in it, mind you, but it also has a few points where the plot pivots on its heels. It manages to keep you wondering &quot;who&quot; without depriving you of the psychological torment that someone normally expects from Argento.(And, if you get the chance, you should pick it up with Deep Red in the Dario Argento Collection.)",5,The Novelist's Delimma,1021766400,"05 19, 2002",0.2952
68,A3AAK33K3BUUTM,764005693,trashcanman,"[0, 0]","I often wonder if when Dario Argento passes a beautiful woman while walking down the street, does he think to himself I'd love to kill the hell out of her!. The man has both a talent and a fetish for taking the sexiest women he can find and doing abominably brutal things to them on film. Not a complaint, mind you; just an observation. A wise man once proclaimed death by Argento is heavenly. Indeed, there is no more stylish way for a gorgeous actress to go out then in a torrent of red in one of the man's horror films. Tenebre has the highest onscreen bodycount of any Argento film I've seen so far and that's an accomplishment in itself. It's a rather by-the-book murder-mystery which often pays homage to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tales ofSherlock Holmesboth in word and in story. Its an exceptionally watchable film for more casual viewers who don't take their horror with Argento's usual doses of surrealism and is an all-around solid entry into Italy's pantheon of giallo classics.10 things I learned from Tenebre:1) Don't ever give a Doberman attitude.2) Butterfaces = transsexuals. It'sCrying Gametime!3) Clubbing yourself with a rock: surprisingly sound strategy.4) Trick razor blades are fun and practical. Fool your friends!5) Lesbian lover's spats are HOT...and invariably lead to horrible death.6) Horrible death: also hot.7) Red paint prices going up or just to lazy to pick up a brush? Try dismemberment!8) When running away from a serial killer, always face away from the impending death regardless of your hotness or the camera's location.9) Keep all wooden fences in good repair at all times.10) Argento REALLY likes red.Tenebre is another outstanding entry to the genre from the master and should entertain nearly any fan of murder-mysteries and/or horrific violence. The score is amazing, the red keeps a-flowin', the clothes keep a-coming off of the women, and the mystery will keep you guessing until the end makes you shout bulls!+! at your television. But all's fair in love, war, and mysteries so deal with it. I'm not a fan of the genre due to the rigid formulaic nature of the storytelling, but I occasionally partake and as far as giallo goes, you can scarcely do better than this.",4,Any humiliation which stood in his way could be swept aside by the simple act of annihilation.

Excellent suspence, brilliant plot, effective introspection of the main and secondary actors, nailbiting soundtrack and horrible mutilations mix up together in a twist of the death nerve up to the very last sequence, a neverending scream which will rock your cradle, preventing you from falling asleep...Another great product from Anchor Bay Entertainment, with a widescreen presentation (1.85.1) and two audio tracks: Italian in mono and English in DS 5.1. Don't miss the interesting audio commentary by Dario Argento, music composer Claudio Simonetti and journalist Loris Curci. The extra features comprise the theatrical trailer, two behind-the-scenes segments, one of which deals with interesting audio effects, and the alternate end credits music, strongly disapproved by the Maestro.One of Argento's best movies and one of the best ABE product, uncut and uncensored (check Veronica Lario's arm amputation, a blood bath missing even in the European versions of the film!)",5,Perversions of a dangerous mind...,1052784000,"05 13, 2003",0.2742

The book is deemed by some to be sick and sexist (since the victims in the book are females). However, a homicidal fanatic is killing people in the same fashion of the book! The movie definately has the stylish touch of Mr. Argento. Also, I found the cast to be rather superb (John Saxon is in it, and he always gives a good performance). A nice surprise ending too (though it would be somewhat copied in Stendhal Syndrome). Definately worth watching. Hell, buy it!",5,One of Argento's best,1083456000,"05 2, 2004",-0.0739
