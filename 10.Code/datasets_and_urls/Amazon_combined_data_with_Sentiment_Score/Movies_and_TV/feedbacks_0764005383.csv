The creeps that are selling these for 200.00 to 280.00 for 9 episodes are just plain Absurd. Save your money and wait for the whole series to come out it is just a matter of time according to my knowledge. At East you get a lot more episodes for 25.00 or maybe 30.00 the most. Th Series defintely gets 5 stars....................,1,Great Series But Ridiculus Prices..........................,1139270400,"02 7, 2006",0.2051

The second season episode Sixty Five on the Aisle is in it's place. I was bummed, because I really wanted to see the Ethel Merman episode, but I am happy to have ANY episodes of this great retro show on home video. I bought the VHS box set several years ago and am wondering if anyone has noticed if they fixed this accidental goof. I would buy the DVD and chuck my VHS set if I knew the Merman episode was on it. However, each one is highly enjoyable, with This Little Piggy Had a Ball alone worth the price of the whole set.This was a great show and I would love to see more volumes released.",4,"Great show, but Ethel Merman episode is NOT in the VHS set",1119744000,"06 26, 2005",0.2003
4,A2NJO6YE954DBH,764005383,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[48, 50]","You have to give Marlo Thomas, daughter of television legend Danny Thomas (Make Room for Daddy), for starting a definite trend in situation comedies with That Girl, which aired on ABC from 1966 to 1971; a lot of us remember the show from when ABC showed reruns during the day from 1969 to 1972). In the wake of That Girl came other comedies about Independent Women such as The Doris Day Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and Rhoda. Marlo Thomas played Ann Marie, a perky young actress who left the home of her father (Lew Parker) and mother (Rosemary DeCamp) in Brewster, New York, to make it on her own in New York City. Since all she could find where roles in television commercials and small parts in plays here and there, she had to support herself with a lot of odd jobs around town. This provided ample opportunity for new venues for comic encounters between new characters and That Girl. Along for the ride was Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell), a junior executive at Newsview magazine who spent all five seasons trying to get That Girl down the aisle.This first DVD gives us nine choice episodes from the show's entire run:(1) The pilot episode Don't Just Do Something, Stand There (September 8, 1966) begins our saga as Ann is working as a candy clerk and meets Donald. When he sees her again she is doing a perfume commercial where she gets kidnapped by two robbers. Donald thinks this is real and comes to her rescue with predictable results.(2) Anatomy of a Blunder (Episode 5, October 6, 1966), has Ann bringing Donald home to meet her parents but making the mistake of stopping for a nice little picnic along the way.(3) Counter Proposal (Episode 113, Season premier for Season 5, September 25, 1970) completes the informal Donald Trilogy that opens this disc with the moment when Donald finally asks Ann to marry him. That is the good news; the bad news is that his co-worker Bob Howard (Ronnie Schell) talks Donald into buying an engagement ring second hand from Mr. Franklin (Avery Schreiber). Note: This is the first episode to feature lyrics for the That Girl theme song.(4) Call of the Wild (Episode 50, January 25, 1968) has Ann insulted when she is hired to be the Creamy Soap Girl because the producer (Jesse White) sees her as having the sort of face that will not make housewives jealous. Consequently, Ann is convinced she has no sex appeal, and that is not something for That Girl to take without a fight.(5) Nobody Here But Us Chickens (Episode 90, October 9, 1969) continues the bad commercial gigs as Ann is hired by Major Culpepper (Slim Pickens) to be the Dancing Chicken for his friend chicken chain. When the Major tries to hit on her in his car, Ann hits the road (guess how she is dressed).(6) The Snow Must Go On (Episode 93, October 30, 1969) finds Ann and Donald stuck with her parents at Kennedy Airport during a blizzard. Of course Ann has a Broadway audition to go to and nothing short of complete and total disaster will stop her.(7) This Little Piggy Had a Ball (Episode 28, March 23, 1967),has Ann enduring one the peculiar tribulations of sit com stars, getting something stuck in something at the wrong time. Just cross Lucy's bowling ball with Laura Petrie's toe, and you get the idea. Rob Reiner plays Carl and Teri Garr is Estelle in this episode.(8) Pass the Potatoes, Ethel Merman (Episode 31, season premier for 2nd season, September 7,1 967) has the legendary Broadway star herself picking Ann for a walk on role in Gypsy. You know this sounded like a good idea at the time. Merman would return later that season and become The Other Woman for Ann's father.(9) Those Friars (Episode 127, January 8, 1971) features not only Danny Thomas but also Mr. Television himself, Milton Berle as guest stars. Strangely enough, the two television legends play themselves. It seems that Ann's uncle, an old vaudevillian has died, and the two pop out to try and buy the old trunk left to her in Uncle Harry's will.I am not particularly enamored of the That Girl television series and its ability to end each and every teaser with the title phrase, but whoever selected these nine episodes did a pretty good job. There is no special wedding episode of the series because Donald only got as far as a stage party (plus Thomas did not want to send the wrong message to young women by making that the end of the series), but these episodes are certainly representative of what this show was about. You also have an impressive set of guest stars and it was a nice touch saving daddy for the last one. Yes, your favorite might not be included in these nine episodes--mine was I Ain't Got Nobody, when Ann's face was put on someone else's body in the centerfold of Playpen magazine--but there is not a bad episode in this bunch.",5,Marlo Thomas as That Girl: Think Women's Lib Lite,1051747200,"05 1, 2003",0.1553

Ann Marie was a role model to me at a time when few good ones were to be found; and Marlo Thomas represented all the same admirable qualities in real life. I quickly bought every episode available on VHS and, later, the only DVD that, to date, has been issued. When will we see more on DVD? Is Anchor Bay Entertainment listening?

Love the photos on the packaging, just wish they would have used the original THAT GIRL logo and lettering instead of the non-related logo used. A very small complaint for a perfect job by ANCHOR BAY! If you like the show...you will love these episodes. Hope the second video set comes out on DVD too! Keep going with the series as IMAGE is doing with I SPY! Also, love the Marlo promo at the end of the first episode aired. Would love to see more extras like that...promos, etc. I know a few collectors that have some if you need them. GREAT JOB! Rick",5,THAT GIRL is THAT GOOD!,987379200,"04 16, 2001",0.4808

8,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,764005383,trebe,"[35, 35]","&quot;That Girl&quot; was a groundbreaking TV program. The source of this program's appeal is of course Marlo Thomas, in the role that defined her acting career. Thomas as the perky Ann Marie, and Ted Bessell as the handsome, logical Donald Hollinger made perhaps the perfect sixties TV couple, rivaled in popularity perhaps only by Don Adams and Barbara Feldon of &quot;Get Smart&quot;. Show-stealer Lew Parker is also outstanding as Ann's crusty dad, a restaurant owner with a machine gun style of delivering dialog, who thinks that every guy who dates his daughter is just a &quot;bum&quot;. These episodes are, to use an overused term, &quot;classic TV&quot;, and should not be missed by any true aficionado of 60's television. Hopefully this is the first of many releases for this wonderful program, which still seems fresh after 35 years.This first collection of episodes is an attempt at capturing an overview of the series. While this effort is for the most part successful, it could have been arranged better. Anchor Bay should be applauded for including nine episodes of &quot;That Girl&quot; on this first release. Total runtime is a whopping 225 minutes. Compare that to Star Trek's standard two episodes per DVD. Instead of being arranged in chronological order, the episodes are subdivided into three thematic groups, which may not have been the best idea.The series first aired in 1966, and ended in 1971. During that time, the characters, particularly Ann and Donald undergo significant changes in appearance and wardrobe. There is no mistaking the Ann of 1966 with the Ann of 1971. By not following chronological order, we see the characters changing appearance significantly between some episodes, disrupting continuity. Also, two consecutive episodes feature instances of Ann's employer making a pass at her. Once again, a little more thought could have gone into how the episodes were arranged. These are minor quibbles, but as a result, the overall flow of the episodes is somewhat uneven, and doesn't feel quite right. For any future releases, I suggest that the episodes be arranged closer to chronological order.The fact that there are no bonus materials is also a major disappointment, especially as this is the first collection of episodes to be released. The printed booklet is a good start, but this series deserves much more. A series retrospective would have been nice. An interview with Ms. Thomas, the only member of the principal cast who is still with us, would have been appropriate. Anchor Bay should be aiming to build the audience for the forthcoming releases. Overall video quality is very good, although focus does suffer at times.Despite these criticisms, &quot;That Girl&quot; is not to be missed. Take a trip back to a world far removed from today. The signature hairstyle, the music, the bowling ball stuck on the toe, and Ann dancing in a chicken suit, are all waiting for you. Experience the charm of &quot;That Girl&quot;.Can't wait for Volume 2.",4,Nice first effort.,999648000,"09 5, 2001",0.1866
