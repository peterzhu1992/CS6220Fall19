The show, however, takes place in the early 1900s in posh London. It is truly a first class operation, fine acting, beautiful sets, superb period costumes, enthralling storylines, and just plain fun to watch; yes there is a share of humor.The premise of the show is the upperclass extremely wealthy family of four, parents and their two adult children. The adult children make their presence periodically, and the servants have their share of dramatic escapades in the lower part of the mansion.The characters are all memorable, engaging, and quite entertaining to absorb. What makes this such an addictive series to watch is what you learn about how the wealthy and servants behave, perform, and communicate. The episodes take you several places without one getting over exposed by the same sets. It is a wonderful lesson on historical periods.What's good is that you may need to use the subtitles, due to the accents, and just to learn so many new phrases and words that cover interesting topics that one is no familiar with. The subtitles for Season One are very good, no gaps, and correct titles.Plus, the episodes are fast-paced, nothing drags, content is filled with dialogue.Once you start this, you just keep going into more and more....

15,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,767002652,Anastasia McPherson Bibliophile,"[1, 2]","The English class system is endlessly fascinating, especially when contrasting the difference between those in the drawing room and those behind the green baize door. This is why Upstairs Downstairs, both the original and the update, Manor House and Gosford Park have been so popular. Viewers can put themselves in the shoes of those both up and down.The new Upstairs Downstairs seeks to update a beloved classic and does a good job. Indeed, my only complaint is that this series was only three episodes long and we didn't get enough complexity in the stories. The story begins with aristocratic newlyweds moving into the family mansion on Eaton Place. The house is re-decorated in the moderne style and that and the costumes are worth the price of admission, especially to lovers of deco. The family is rounded out by relatives who come to stay, in this case, the husband's overbearing mother and the wife's trouble-making sister. German fascists were courting the English aristocracy throughout the thirties and into the forties and the English flirtation with fascism makes an appearance in the person of German Ambassador Ribbentrop and the attendance of the sister and chauffeur at fascist meetings. Jewish refugees come to the household in the form of a university professor turned upstairs maid and her daughter. The class system that will be completely swept away by the end of the war is examined from every perspective. The infamous Mrs. Simpson makes a delightful appearance and English ambivalence to her person and her role is well-played here.All of the elements of a great story are here, but the series is just too short. Episodes need to be longer and stories need to be further developed. Everything felt rushed. Comparison with the superior Downton Abbey are inevitable, but I think this has the potential to be just as good, provided the second season expands on the groundwork laid here.High marks to the costumer and set designer.",4,Good Update of a Classic,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",0.1962

Season 2 is twice as long and by the end I was pumped for a third season as Britain was on the brink of WWII. Sadly, there won't be a Season 3. I never saw the original Upstairs Downstairs, so I can't compare this to that one. It wasn't until I was finished watching Season 2 that I learned two of the actors from the original series were a part of this updated version.

It became an entirely different series without her. I read that the series was not sure if she would recover and be able to participate in the second season and they attempted to hold her spot open. It definitely suffered without her or a good script to bridge the gap. It lost credibility especially in the last three episodes. The ending was wholly unfortunate and unbelievable. In the end I think Jean Marsh was only able to participate briefly in two episodes. I would have liked to have seen a third season but while the ratings took a nose dive in the UK they remained steady in the USA. I believe the decision to cancel was made before the second season was released in the USA and I wonder if they don't have regrets as it did well in the US market.

22,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,767002652,Atheen M. Wilson Atheen,"[0, 0]","I'm sort of glad I started with the fifth season, because while I still enjoy the characters in their first season form, I have a greater appreciation for their incredible development as people over the course of the series. Having seen the beloved cook Mrs. Bridges in her final form in Season Five, it was positively shocking to see her sell some of the household's food for her own personal gain. I know that it was done at the time--it may well have been expected and accepted by employers--but I could hardly have imagined her doing so! Had I watched the series from beginning to end as most people do, I would have missed this sense of personal growth and integrity, because I would already have forgotten the passing event by the end of the series. That would have been sad.In Season One, the viewer is introduced to all the main characters. Their edges are raw here, because they have yet to undergo the smoothing and sorting process that occurs among members of the same household. The era is the very early 1900's and the costumes, manners and technology produce a sense of ambiance that is almost like being there. The social inequities of the period are the central focus of this season, probably because it is the aspect of early twentieth century England most likely to come to mind to writers wanting to create a real experience for viewers. Certainly to anyone steeped in Dickens as most of the contributers probably were, this would be the easiest theme to begin with for a new program. This would also have been a good point to pick during the turbulant 1970s, when everything about society was (again) being questioned by the young of the time.Most of the season deals with the realities of being a poor person dependent upon a wealthy household for his or her well being. The steep fall from the safety of a domestic position to destitution is made very clear. The sacrifice of personal dignity or even physical integrity in order to avoid the crushing poverty of urban England is made abundantly clear by the events in the life of the house maid Sarah, the scullery maid Emily, and the footman Albert. Much of the action seems to be seen from the perspective of the upper parlor maid, Rose, who throughout the seasons takes a very leading role in events both upstairs and downstairs. By using her as their foil, the writers manage to make the realities of the more unfortunate characters much more realistic. Rose sees the rise and fall of many individuals in the household and clings tenaciously to the safety of her role in the house. She is also witness to the frustrations of those above stairs, especially the younger members of the household who have a foot in both the old world of their elders and the new one that is being technologically forced on them.Above stairs, the social mores of the upper class reveal the extent to which they are also hamstrung by expectations and demands. James Belamy is unable to find satisfaction in his role as heir. The acceptable careers open to him are limited and framed by expectations. Elizabeth, his sister, having acheived a level of education and social awareness that is not generally allowed in upper class women, struggles unsuccessfully with the social ills of her time, only to find she is not taken seriously and that she is completely unprepared for the realities of the poor or to make any effective changes in their condition. She can only give them food and clothing, a bandaid on a situation that obviously requires major surgery! Lady Marjorie--and indirectly her mother--a woman who has the mind and abilities of a man but who must work politically through her husband leads a pampered but rather boring life, waiting to host influential parties for her husband. Her husband Richard, is a man of common origins made 1st viscount Bellamy. His upbringing as a middle class person--son of a minister--puts his values and his actions often at odds, creating a marvelous dramatic dissonance. His decisions, while noble, are not always realistic or wise given the situations in which he finds himself, making him the very illustration of a man whose good intentions lead so often to disaster or at least unpleasantness. Married to an aristocrat whose money finances his political career and lifestyle, he is often unable to do what his conscience dictates but must dance to the tune played by his in-laws.What stands out most, especially after viewing the final season, is how the sometimes tragic events of the lives of these people brings them closer and closer together. Their consideration of and feelings for one another over the course of the 5 seasons is heartwarming. Even while we realize that the social ills of the time in which the characters lived were unpleasant, we can't help but feel it is from this type of caring that individuals survived and improved their world, and it gives us hope for our own.A wonderful period piece, and marvelous drama.",5,"A wonderful period piece, and marvelous drama.",1282348800,"08 21, 2010",0.2725

In the legendary first series we are introduced to politician Richard Bellamy (David Langton), his beautiful wife Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) and their children James (Simon Williams) and Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett). Downstairs, their staff, Hudson the butler (Gordon Jackson), Mrs Bridges the cook (Angela Baddeley), Rose the maid (Jean Marsh) and Emily the scullery maid (Evin Crowley) attempt to uphold their own values whilst coming to grips with an ever-changing world.Originally-devised by actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, the series explored the day-to-day life of servant and master in the Edwardian period, a time of great political and social upheaval. The series later took the Bellamy family into the First World War (Series 4, regarded by most as the greatest), the 1920s flapper period and the impending Stock Market crash (Series 5).As the series opens, it is the year 1903, and great changes are afoot for the Bellamy family.On Trial - Into the structured Bellamy household whirls the unconventional free-spirit Clemence Delise (Pauline Collins) who is applying for the new position of parlourmaid. After Lady Marjorie re-names the girl Sarah, she is quickly inducted into the residence, but it soon becomes clear that Sarah's true calling isn't in domestic service.The Mistress and the Maids - Lady Marjorie sits for an important society painter, but it's Sarah who enflames his creative talents.Board Wages - When the Bellamy's leave London for the weekend, Sarah and the servants are left to their own devices. But when James unexpectedly returns home early, Sarah is thrown into a dilemma which could see her walk away from Eaton Place.The Path of Duty - Elizabeth returns home from a German finishing school, but her stubborn, willful streak is still very much intact. When she must make her formal society debut, Elizabeth exposes her parents to a huge scandal by running away.A Suitable Marriage - The visiting Baron von Rimmer seems the perfect prospective husband for Elizabeth...or is he?A Cry for Help - Richard becomes entangled in scandal when the new maid appeals for his assistance in a delicate private matter.Magic Casements - Lady Marjorie enjoys a tender but brief affair with one of James' military friends.I Dies from Love - Emily becomes infatuated with a footman, leading to dire consequences when her affections are not returned.Why Was Her Door Locked? - An emotionally-distraught Mrs Bridges plunges the Bellamy family into disgrace when she kidnaps a baby.A Voice from the Past - Whilst helping in a soup kitchen, James and Elizabeth stumble onto a homeless Sarah, and decide to take her back to Eaton Place. The situation becomes complicated when Elizabeth learns of James' affair with Sarah during her previous employment at the house.The Swedish Tiger - Sarah becomes a pawn in a plan to rob the Bellamy's of priceless antiques.The Key of the Door - Elizabeth comes of age, but her headstrong attitude once again causes friction with her parents, when she befriends Evelin Larkin and her group of socialists.For Love of Love - Elizabeth finally marries poet Lawrence Kirbridge at the request of her parents, and James rekindles his affair with Sarah, who is now a music-hall singer.Due to a technician's strike in 1971, the first six episodes were taped in black-and-white, and an alternate colour version of the first episode was filmed later on, for broadcasters who didn't wish to screen the black and white episodes. In the colour broadcasts, Sarah leaves at the end of the first episode On Trial, but the complete B&W;/colour inclusive series has her leave at the end of Board Wages. UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS is still often aired without the crucial black and white episodes, but the DVD edition includes the complete story arc with no omissions and both versions of the On Trial episode.",5,top drama series,1140912000,"02 26, 2006",0.3769

The cast in this revival was terrific, the era of its setting has much for writers to work with, and I for one loved seeing so much more of the house (really a cast member in itself) than we ever did in the first Upstairs Downstairs.

It's a sleek, glittering affair with lots of actual historical figures and events, but the story never forgets that the real focus is on the people both upstairs and downstairs.The year is 1936. George V has just died, his feckless son is involved with Mrs. Simpson, and Hitler is on the rise. Sir Hallam Holland (Ed Stoppard) and his wife Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes) move into 165 Eaton Place, intending to turn the mausoleum into a livable house. So they employ Rose Buck (Jean Marsh), who was once a maid at their house, to find them some suitable servants.Soon the house has plenty of new inhabitants. Downstairs: fussy but kind butler Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough), snobby cook Mrs.Thackeray (Anne Reid), hot-tempered footman Johnny (Nico Mirallegro), and others. Upstairs: Agnes' snotty fascist sister Persie (Claire Foy), and Sir Hallam's bossy globe-trotting mother Maud (Dame Eileen Atkins) and her warmhearted secretary Amanjit (Art Malik).And while Lady Agnes hoped to have the perfect home, 165 Eaton Place is soon rocked by a series of problems -- an arrest, dabblings in fascism, a pregnancy, a birth, a death, constant friction between Maud and Agnes, and the discovery of secret children upstairs and down.Technically the new Upstairs Downstairs is a sequel to the old one, but it's not necessary to have seen the older Upstairs Downstairs to understand what's going on. There are some nods and references -- particularly the presence of housemaid-turned-housekeeper Rose -- but it's mostly a self-contained story.The writers do a great job of packing a whole season's worth of drama, sorrow, joy and soap-opera mayhem into just three hours, but somehow it never feels rushed. And they also do an adept job at weaving the story of 165 Eaton Place together with real-life events -- Ribbentrop and Simpson make cameos, Persie becomes involved with fascism, and Hallam is good friends with the Duke of York (later the king).And it has a talented cast of well-respected actors (Keeley Hawes, Dame Aileen Atkins, the weirdly stiff Ed Stoppard, Adrian Scarborough, Art Malik and of course Jean Marsh), as well as a few newbies (Nico Mirallegro, Ellie Kendrick). The only problematic character is Claire Foy's -- Persephone is such a selfish, repulsive character that it's pretty much impossible to care what happens to her.Upstairs Downstairs is a solid miniseries that stands on its own merits, but leaves the door open just in case.

Three not-quite one-hour episodes are not enough. The story is choppy. Instead of being developed, the characters have been served to us in a narrative shorthand: the brittle haughty wife; the nobly motivated husband; the perversely promiscuous sister; the equally promiscuous but good-hearted maid; the footman, who is a barking fascist in one episode but then, in the next episode, has a sudden unexplained change of heart. All have been set against a sketchy historical background of social and political problems of the '30s: the problem of members of the upper classes who supported the fascists; the problem of European refugees; the problem of what to do with mentally challenged relatives of the aristocracy; the problems of class and race.Various notable personages drift in and out of the house briefly: foreign minister Anthony Eden; German ambassador von Ribbentrop; Mrs. Simpson; the Duke of Kent (presumably Bertie was occupied in another film with his speech lessons); society photographer Cecil Beaton (in a scene with the cook that would have been delightful had it not been hastily imposed onto the narrative without much point). Furthermore, the historical element has been inserted into the story so perfunctorily that unless one is thoroughly familiar with it (as one should be, ideally), the viewer might wonder who this Anthony person is, who keeps bossing Lord Hallam about.There are lots of excellent possibilities in respect to this series, but they need to be developed over time: six or seven one-and-a-half hour episodes, are recommended.",3,Downton Abbey Lite,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",0.0246

In this 2010 Masterpiece Theater miniseries in 3 episodes on 2 discs, it's 1936 (pre World War II) and we have new upstairs and downstairs inhabitants because the Bellamays sold the property many years before. A newly married couple along with the husband's overbearing mother (brilliantly acted by Eileen Atkins--she is wonderful) to wait on the upstairs folks we, of course, get a new crop of servants that are now under Rose, the parlor maid to the Bellamays that's been promoted in this miniseries to head housekeeper. This lavish and greatly acted production gives the audience a peek at the very rich and their servants after World War I along with the political and underclass upheavals in England during the 1930s while Hitler and his forces were gaining strength in Germany.

After airing of The Forsyte Saga (a must series also), Eileen Atkins and Jean Marsh dreamed up the Upstairs Downstairs concept. Jean stared as Rose in the 70s TV blockbuster, and now continues that role in the continuation of the story on Brit TV (Dec '10). 3 episodes (alas only 3) advance the story now to 1936, with a new cast (excepting Marsh who is in both the old and new) and also now including Atkins as Maud. You get the same house, same music, same title. After Upstairs Downstairs the pair of actresses combined again in creating The House of Elliott, another period saga, bloody good Brit drama, an absolute must own complete collection.No disappointment from me or my wife with the 2010 3 episode addition compared to the older TV blockbuster series. The new cast keeps up the believable, compelling stories and character delight. Rose and the house (+ music) gives the old lovers the flavor of the past, even if the interior has been redecorated to 1936. It takes only the 1st episode to fall in love with the new upstairs and downstairs families of 165. Excellent cast. With the long bonus feature, there is a hint at more. For me...like handing a fat man a box of chocolates and asking, Do you want more? YES!Interesting that they had the to be King Geo VI in the show, prior to the abdication of his King brother, and he did not stutter. After the success of The King's Speech about the same time as this series release, that bit of trivia is evident.As for the original Upstairs Downstairs series. It is 27-year span epic winning 9 Emmys, 2 BAFTAs, Golden Globe & a Peabody Award, 31 nominations. The aristocratic Bellamy's of 165 Eaton Place, London, live upstairs over the downstairs clockwork servant aid led by butler Hudson (Gordon Jackson). Classic Edwardian masterful plots in this funny and dramatic back time-travel over 3 decades inside the Bellamy house. A crowning British achievement in the 70's and worth owning today. Since it's period drama it never goes out of style. It's a British TV saga classic.Sir Richard Bellamy MP (David Langton) and Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) have heir Lt James (Simon Williams) and Miss Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett-`A Bit of a Do') who need quite a crew downstairs to keep their house in order. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Brddeley) cooks up a storm, while maid Rose (Jean Marsh, co-creator) helps keep linens and affairs tidy. The pilot (an alternate plot pilot available) introduces new servant Sarah (Pauline Collins), who adds saucy spice to the house on both ends of the stairs. Footman Alfred (George Innes) who quotes Bible, Perce (Brian Osborne) is lady's-man coachman during carriage years, Thomas (John Alderton) chauffeur in later auto episodes. The star studded cast is endless. I strongly recommend you get the 40th Collection and see it while waiting for the new 21st century produced episodes DVD to be released.This newest release (40th Anniversary Collection) provides 21 discs in 5 solid cases all in the anniversary storage sleeve. Quite an improvement from the earlier release. 68 episodes, each about 50 min. Add 25 bonus hrs and you have a value, not to mention the dynamic dramatic entertainment including romance, mystery, drama, historical significance, humor, suspense, & more. Episodes 2,3,4,5,&7 are B/W due to a technicians strike. Pilot was remade in color. The features + bonus time total divided by the current Amazon price makes the HOURLY entertainment cost less than $1.87. A VALUE! Compare that to the new release with only 3 episodes.SUBTITLES-Anniversary set OFFERS SUBTITLES,like the new episodes. Helpful for some of us. A Jean Marsh memories insert is included and created in Oct. 2010.And YES, I bought the new 3 episodes to go with the older episodes.

This modernisation makes all viewers identify with most characters.

A lot of the actors have left the series. Furthermore, the script is written with the benefit of hindsight. People look ridiculous when they correctly forecast what Hitler is going to do. This is really pathetic writing. In addition everyone really cares a lot for the Jews. This is transparently just so that BBC can recoup part of the cost by selling the show to the US. Not everyone was concerned with the Jews in London in 1938. But off course the show makes the Brits look very nice.

The show is about an aristocrat Sir Hallam Holland and his wife Lady Agnes moving back into the London home of his father. Upstairs Downstairs stands for the different life styles and cultures that existed in the home between the servants downstairs and the rich and highly connected owners living upstairs. Eaton Place 165 has a new generation living in the home but the head of the household maid is the same lady who worked in the house when she was a young maid.New staff is hired and some have to be properly trained and they have to get to know each other and learn to work together. Meanwhile Hallam's mother Maud moves in and there is almost instant friction between Hallam, Lady Agnes and the mother-in-law living in the home. In addition Lady Agnes' sister moves in and she is a socialist/fascist want-to-be who causes a lot of problems for Hallam and Agnes.This show contains a lot of drama, tension, personal conflict and it all is brought to the surface perfectly by the excellent cast of the show. The storyline is well done and the writers have done well writing a story that is interesting and fun to watch. I find it interesting to watch the British interpretation of historical characters like Mrs. Simpson, the woman who married the King, Herr Ribbentrop a Nazi leader working in England and the new King of England when he takes over after his brother abdicates his rank as King to marry Mrs. Simpson.The servants also play a major role in keeping the house running properly but also bringing in their own personal problems into the house. This first season sets a lot of ground work for the coming season and the building tensions between Germany and the rest of Europe right before WW II.One character who plays a major role in Season One and Two is Persephone who is the sister of Agnes. She is the sultry, sexy and troublemaking girl whom you will learn to hate. Her selfish and one sided nature is overwhelming and evil and you will either love her or hate her.This is an excellent show and my wife and I loved it.

The house has been inherited by Lord Hallam Holland and he moves in with his wife Lady Agnes. Rose Buck, who now runs a small domestic hiring service, staffs the downstairs and becomes housekeeper. The upstairs dramas include a tyrannical and eccentric mother (Eileen Atkins), an out-of-control sister and glimpses into the life of a foreign office diplomat. Downstairs, there are quite as many intrigues, and when the upstairs and downstairs mix, there are the predictable problems.The scenery is lush, each character is cast with care; in particular, Ed Stoppard (son of dramatist Tom Stoppard) is mesmerizing as the stiff-upper-lip husband and diplomat. But every cast member has plenty of lines and a back story, which makes this an engaging series. The second season, on the cusp of World War II, is even better.It's a shame that Jean Marsh's illness and disagreements about the direction of the scripts (that Eileen Atkins was consulting on, as one of the original developers of Upstairs, Downstairs) ended up with the series cancelled after the second season.

Chronicling the lives of masters and servants in a Belgravia townhouse, Updown, as it is affectionately known, covers about twentyfive years. The first series lasts from about 1903 to 1908. It introduces most of the main characters of the entire chronicle, barring a few later additions to the caste. Most of this first series concerns the career of Sarah, who has the impertinence to come to the front door when she applies for the position of parlormaid in the first episode. We also see the early stages of the career of Elizabeth Bellamy, daughter of the house, as she rebels against the path her life is expected to take by her parents. Some of the episodes in this first series were filmed in black and white, due to a cameramen's strike. I find these particularly effective in portraying the barrenness of life below stairs. Some of the episodes are a bit off target, especially The Swedish Tiger, which is just plain weird, but remember the series had not yet reached classic status when these episodes were filmed.

Yes, there is a great deal of value (both artistic and nostalgic) in having the magnificent Jean Marsh return to 165 Eaton Place as now-elderly housekeeper Rose Buck, providing viewers with a bridge strong and authentic enough to span almost any gap in credibility between the series' two incarnations. Despite the uniformly competent acting, lavish sets, and fine camera-work, however, the new U/D is merely quaint as a stand-alone project, and not nearly as compelling as its predecessor, much less its contemporaneous rival, Downton Abbey.That being said, &#34;quaint&#34; is hardly a thing to sniff-at in a television landscape littered with mountains of garbage, so in this respect the series is satisfying, in a visual &#34;comfort-food&#34; sort of way. The plot is essentially the same as it always was, though there's a whole new family of quasi-aristocrats in Belgravia. These are largely stock characterizations. Testy and eccentric mother-in-law? Check. Brooding Lord of the manor? Check. Insecure wife? Check. Troublesome, sexy ingenue? Yep. Downstairs we find the same lovably predictable types: proud, moralizing butler; crotchety old cook; flirty, common-as-muck parlor maid, etc. The storylines are crisp, economic, and convincing, if utterly derivative, and the proceedings are helped immensely by the pre-WWII historical setting. The folks above and below benefit by sharing a common anxiety on the eve of ruin, one that drives and underpins these six episodes, which might otherwise have gone completely off the boil.If you like English period dramas, sitting-room contretemps dramas, and the like, put some popcorn in the microwave, get in your jammies, and watch Series One in its entirety on some rainy Sunday. You could do a lot worse, entertainment-wise.

A true piece of television history for five seasons of groundbreaking drama, the modernization certainly had a lot to live up to. So I was very surprised that this promised series only had three episodes--and it was actually a sequel of sorts as opposed to a re-imagining. Well, the truth of the matter is--this version definitely lacks the bite and complexity of the original series. But with such a limited running time, I suppose that was to be expected. However, the resultant product (while perhaps not the stuff of TV legend) is a fitfully entertaining confection in its own right. Glossy, well produced, well acted--this version may be slightly superficial, but it sure is likable enough.Set several years after 165 Eaton Place closed it doors, the current series is set in 1936 at the precipice of world conflict. New inhabitants (Ed Stoppard and Keeley Hawes) move onto the premises and must rebuild the house to its former glory. Hawes enlists the aid of an employment specialist (Jean Marsh reprising the infamous role of Rose, but with a bit less pluck) to staff the quarters. Complicating matters, the indomitable Eileen Atkins (cue expected Emmy nomination) is on hand as the free spirited, but strong willed mother in law. The introductory episode plays largely to comedic conventions as Hawes and Atkins engage in subtle warfare. Each episode gets progressively darker, with the rise of fascism playing as the predominant plot point in the second show. And for the finale, things wrap up pretty conveniently for everyone. This is not meant to be a dark historical treatment--the unpleasant backdrop is really secondary to the antics of the cast. It's entertaining soap opera mayhem against the backdrop of history.Again, forty years from now, this won't be considered the enduring classic that its predecessor is. But that's really not its intent. The cast is fun and engaging--there isn't quite the pronounced distinction between Upstairs and Downstairs that helped define the original. Funny and touching, it's hard not to be enchanted by this show even with its more fluffy approach. I thought everyone was great--but once again, Atkins takes the prize for most valuable player. Haughty, hysterical, and surprisingly down to earth--she will be what I remember most about this contemporary visit to the legendary 165 Eaton Place. And if you haven't seen the original, do so.

I highly enjoyed Downton Abbey, which I'd heard had the same feel- showcasing the family as well as the servants of the house, I absolutely adore Claire Foy, and it looked great in all the teasers I saw. Unfortunately, I thought it was a disappointment.I don't know if it's because it had the misfortune to be aired so soon after Downton Abbey or what, but I couldn't help comparing the two. I just felt this one paled in comparison. Honestly, it was pretty good...but not great. I don't know if I would think more highly of it if I saw it first or not. I'm inclined to think not, but I'm really not sure.I'll say one thing I loved about the show- the look. It was gorgeous- the sets, the costumes, the production values were all top-notch. Claire Foy has always been beautiful (and looks great in period clothing) but I have a soft spot for '30s fashions (my favorite part of the 2005 King Kong was the costumes and scenery as well!) and she really shined more than ever in them. I found myself so envious at times and wishing I could look just like her...silly I know. Her character wasn't very nice, but she sure was pretty.The main point against this show was the lack of likable characters. Jean Marsh was pretty forgettable, which I found surprising, given her history with the show and her performance as Mrs. Ferrars in Sense and Sensibility. I've never been a big fan of Keeley Hawes and she gave the usual blah performance here. It's not that everybody was bad or anything, but most of the decent characters were simply not very memorable.The other big problem was the storytelling itself. There were a good bit of nice moments throughout, but the whole was less than the sum of its parts here. Everything seemed to move too fast- the character development and everything just didn't seem believable to me. One minute a man and woman are fighting, the next they're in bed, the next they've broken up. A new character is introduced, given a backstory, and killed off in the same episode. Everybody's got all these issues but then at the end everything gets all wrapped up with no explanation. It was just like they tried to cram too many storylines in too little time.Maybe with a new screenwriter, the next season could be an improvement? I dunno. It wasn't terrible. It had some nice moments and was a beautiful production. Unfortunately, it's not good for the sets and costumes to outshine the actors.",3,Crammed too much in,1304294400,"05 2, 2011",0.1302

In one aspect of retrospect, it is almost hard to see how it was renewed for a second season. The first season is relatively flat, has technical flaws, and only by the barest of margins does it begin to sow seeds or lay the bricks of an engrossing story line and character development to come. If one did not know the future of this program, and thus be encouraged to continue viewing it beyond Season 1, one would probably not tune in for subsequent Seasons. Season 1 basically boils down to the dysfunction of both the upper and lower classes of civilization. We have the exact same dysfunction in the 21st Century. &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; probably survived the 1970's because we had not seen anything quite like it before; it was the &#34;new kid&#34; on the block and of course coming from Britain it was thought to have a leg up on any American sense of sophisticated television.",3,LOOKING BACK,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",0.0322

This turned out to be a wonderfully done period drama that, instead of choosing to romanticize the era, took it on headlong and approached such topics as the evolving political scene and how it directly affected the lives of the occupants of 165 Eaton Place with depth, while still being tactful. In other words, the story did not deflate from the inclusion of such a sensitive topic, rather, gave the series a more believable dimension.Another thing I was impressed by was how there was not a single extraneous character, how all the different story lines came together so artfully. In particular, Adrian Scarborough's portrayal of Warwick Pritchard, the Butler, was absolutely delightful - he stole every scene he was in and I found myself disappointed that Pritchard didn't have more time on screen. If I wasn't hopelessly enamoured with Upstairs/Downstairs already, his stepping in to deliver Lady Agnes' baby would have sealed the deal for me.I will say that this did suffer a bit from the time constraints. Three hour long episodes were not really enough, and there were instances where elements of the plot felt rushed - even a little choppy - although that could very well be from PBS' habit of cutting out several minutes worth of often pivotal scenes when UK programs air on Masterpiece. Overall, however, despite my complaints about the length, it was inspiring, enjoyable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in British drama.",5,An Instant Favorite,1303862400,"04 27, 2011",0.5166

Might have been possible for Mr. Bellamy, Hudson and Kate..but Edward and Daisy were still young and so was Virginia lots younger than her husband.

Another problem was the number of viewers who actually remembered the seventies series and came to love it who are still around and who would compare it to the original vs. the new viewers who had no prior knowledge of the series. And thats why I think it was a great effort by the producers to take both audiences into consideration. By making Rose the fulcrum of the story they had the connective tissue to the original.And Jane Marsh was great as usual. The young Bellamys and the turbulent /30's were all a wise choice.

Some of our favorites: You-re Got Mail & Sleepless in Seattle always had references to older Romantic classic movies or novels. Therefore we found ourselves watching & loving many Jean Austin remakes including several A&E DVD's. This lead to a British invasion within our house starting with Darling Buds of May & All Creatures Great & Small. Darling Buds of May was a little racy for our taste & All Creatures Great & Small started out rather slow, but in the end we have been watching these 2 British TV Classics over & over. I then told my wife about Upstairs Downstairs & we decided not to buy the whole series, but to test out the first season. The series is rather racy for our tastes (as was Darling Buds of May), normally at a PG level, but at times travels up to a R rating & just when you think it will go too far, it jumps back to PG just in time. We were both surprise to see Pauline Collins of No, Honesty as a maid named Sarah in the first Black & White series. For my review, I will not write about the plots & characters because other people before me have done a great job & we need not repeat them here. As a professional photographer (wedding photographer for 15 years) & owner of a better than avg 5.1 audio video system (NHT 5.1) the Black & White series has better photography & sound: all very clean & clear. The color series on the other hand, is a wreak both sight & sound. There are at times late 1960ish TV lines that invaded the screen that throw off the timing of the sound. This must be a straight no edited copy that has no value as a piece of photography art, but a run through just to get the product out. In fact, there is a VHS hum throughout, something I never experienced with a DVD. As a British TV series with the actors & plot, I would rate this as a 4, but as a DVD a 2, therefore the avg out is 3. Both me & my wife will not continue with the series because there were no moral outcomes within the first season.

It does a good job of showing how the servant situation had changed in 20 years--much more difficult to get domestic assistance as qualified as that before the first war. But Rose does her best with what she has, and the result is a huge help for a struggling young diplomat. (Though the aging sequence is still tricky--when the first series closes in 1930, she should be late 40's or 50, but still looks 30-35; when the new series opens in 1936, she def. looks well over 60; but that problem existed with the Bellamy father and son, too, when they looked more like brothers as the first series neared its close.)These episodes, however, although beautifully produced, lacked development, which the earlier series of UpDown displayed so beautifully; of course, the notoriously short attention-span of the modern viewer, and the expense of such a production, were probably prohibative, but we really did not have quite enough time to grow attached to the characters--except perhaps for the Jewish lady, a refugee who becomes a maid. Jean Marsh was wonderful, as was Eileen Atkins; and the ambassador's wife did show some character development, I thought, but her sister seemed hopeless, a puzzling lack of compassion in someone so young. I did think her brother-in-law, the diplomat himself, was very well done--it is difficult in this day and age to play a noble character convincingly, and he did; the ship steward/new butler was also a very endearing character, and the young maid, too.So much preferred it to Downtown--far less soap-opera like, but could have been fleshed out for a superior product; a continuation to see if 165 Eaton Place survives WWII would be very interesting.",4,"Great potential; edges over Downtown soap-opera, just.",1303776000,"04 26, 2011",0.145

I decided to try it now, since I knew it had a similar premise to DA. It wasn't love at first sight, but by the third episode I was hooked. DA is still my favorite, but I do find UD very entertaining and look forward to each new episode. I have just started Season 2.Of course, it is true that it's not the lavish production that DA is. As some other reviewers mentioned, it is set up more like a play with limited sets, and I find the characters on DA more attractive and likeable, but the characters in UD have grown on me the more I watch. There are some similarities where I think DA may have copied UD.I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said there should be subtitles/closed captioning. I always use the subtitle option when available, esp. when watching something where the actors have an accent. There's nothing wrong with my hearing, but I don't think anyone catches every single word of every single movie, and subtitles do help in this regard. The British accent can sometimes be hard to decipher, esp when the actors talk faster or more quietly. I'm sure the Brits feel the same way about American actors! ;-)The way I see it, now I have TWO great miniseries to look forward to watching! Still waiting for the new season of Mad Men.

295,A2Z13QAST1E7Q9,767002652,Tiggah the Anglophile,"[14, 14]","It is no exaggeration to say that this classic early 70's British period drama is one of the all-time best series of its sort ever produced; in fact, it is the yardstick against which all other period dramas have been measured ever since. Five series were produced in total (on five boxed sets), and the entire series covers a time span of nearly 30 years (from early Edwardian England in 1903, through the horrors of the First World War, the Roaring 20s, and finally concluding with 1929`s stock market crash).The setting is the household of the Bellamy family at 165 Eaton Place, London. Upstairs live Richard Bellamy, MP, and his beautiful, aristocratic wife, Lady Margery. The Bellamys have two adult children, Captain James and Elizabeth, who come and go much like a recurring motif (though recurring nightmare might be more appropriate, for they are the source of much grief (albeit unintended) for their society parents). I don't wish to give the storylines, scandals and surprises away. Suffice it to say that as the series progress, there are lovers, marriages, births and deaths (not to mention the arrival of a beautiful young niece) which impact on the relationships and alter the composition of the group above stairs.Downstairs we are privy to the lives of the servants in the Bellamy household. First and foremost is the devout, inflexible and regimental head butler, Angus Hudson, the staff overlord. Then there is the curmudgeonly but good-hearted cook, Mrs. Bridges. Other memorable characters to whom we are introduced in the first series include the efficient but sheltered head house/parlour maid, Rose Buck; the religious but simple footman, Alfred; the not-overly-bright scullery maid, Emily; and Lady Margery's prim and snobbish lady's maid, Miss Roberts. Of course, one simply cannot forget the sassy, vivacious new under house/parlour maid, Sarah (Pauline Collins), who is a real dreamer and schemer. Like the family upstairs, the downstairs family too has its share of comings and goings, what with lovers, marriages, deaths, hirings, and firings.The first through fourth boxed sets cover series one through four respectively, and each set contains thirteen 50-minute episodes on seven tapes. The final boxed set (series five) contains sixteen 50-minute episodes on eight tapes.Series one and two cover the Edwardian period from 1903 to King Edward's death in 1910. There is little change in the household throughout these two series, and although the entire series is spectacular, these first two sets are my favourite. Series three covers the period from 1912 to the start of WWI. Series four covers the war (1914-1918), and its depiction of the realities of war from the human standpoint is unsurpassed, making series four a very, very strong series indeed. Series five covers the twenties.In conclusion, this is quite simply an outstanding dramatic series. I would, in fact, go so far as to say that it is required viewing for anyone who enjoys first-rate period drama. But its appeal is broad enough to be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys compelling, captivating, and often thought-provoking drama; and if you enjoy a dramatic series with lots of goings on, scandal, and so forth, you'll enjoy it all the more! I usually recommend buying the first boxed set and then, if you like it, buying the rest. This is one series about which I have no hesitation in recommending that you go ahead and purchase the lot; you won't regret it--it's simply THAT good! And those who've enjoyed Upstairs Downstairs, will surely enjoy The Duchess of Duke Street (both of which were produced by John Hawkesworth).

310,A151T9C99W0AA,767002652,Walter P. Sheppard,"[32, 41]","When the original Upstairs, Downstairs series was in development in the 1970s, script editor Alfred Shaughnessy provided guidelines for the writers. This one was pivotal: Television is electronic theatre and not second-rate film. The new series also called - minus the comma - Upstairs Downstairs ignores this guideline. The result is an indifferent second-rate film that would not get more than a passing glance if it were not for the title, which is a fraudulent attempt to sell itself by connecting with the wildly successful original.It is also tries to make the connection by taking us to 165 Eaton Place, the Bellamy townhouse in the original Up/Down, left in 1930 and vacant ever since. When we arrive at 165 with the new owners in 1936, the very first shot shows clearly that it is not the same townhouse - the pillars framing the portico are fluted rather than plain and a double door opens into the hall, where the original had a single front door. Inside, the hall is dominated by a chandelier that was not there before. The door leading to the servants' area has changed color in the six years the house was unoccupied, and a small diamond-shaped window has appeared in it. The new owners order extensive renovations, but the lavish result would not have fit inside the original townhouse. This 165 Eaton Place would require the dimensions of a mansion to accommodate the upstairs changes. Downstairs, the servants' quarters also bear no resemblance to the original before or after renovation.The original Up/Down rarely left the townhouse. It focused on the characters and their development and interactions, sometimes influenced by events in the real world. Each episode tended to be centered on only one or two characters, and scenes ran for the five or ten or twenty minutes needed to create theatre. Watching them, you got to know and become interested in the achievements and problems of the characters as people. Music was used in a scene only when it came from an on-screen source - a phonograph, an off-screen band, etc.The new Up/Down has a short attention span. It jumps all over the house and London, and it's very involved with events in the real world. By concentrating on those events, the scripts are too superficial to make you care what happens to the characters. And this Up/Down is cursed with virtually continuous background music that is frequently intrusive and often loud enough to interfere with the dialogue.The original Up/Down was conceived by Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, who provide another tenuous connection to it by appearing in this sad reincarnation. We know that they are splendid actresses from their work elsewhere. Here Marsh is wasted as the colorless housekeeper and Atkins's character has only one note, sarcastic bossiness. There is no way to judge the acting abilities of the rest of the cast, which often seems to be on automatic pilot.The BBC has commissioned another six episodes of the new Up/Down. That's fewer than half of a usual series and suggests the Beeb is not completely happy with the first series. It could encourage the new episodes to be electronic theatre by limiting the production to three or four locations inside 165 Eaton Place to force the writer, Heidi Thomas, to populate her scripts with real characters and their relationships with each other, whether upstairs or downstairs, and having only minimal connection to real world events.I always looked forward to seeing each episode of the original Upstairs, Downstairs in its broadcasts from my local PBS station and still do now in repeats from DVDs.The new incarnation has nothing to make me want to watch it again. I can't give it no stars, so I give it one star for effrontery.Addition, August 23, 2011: a BBC press release posted on the Upstairs Downstairs website says that Eileen Atkins has left the cast of the new episodes.

I love the interesting plot lines, the great cast, and the quality of writing. However, the production values are predictably dated and the film quality leaves much to be desired with the effect of looking washed out with dull colors. I hope they will restore the show one of these days and come up with a better quality DVD, with crisp and clear images and sound.When I saw that there was a remake of Upstairs, Downstairs, I was excited especially since I was feeling withdrawal symptoms with the end of Season 2 of Masterpiece Classic: Downton Abbey Season 2, one of my favorite British period dramas. One of the drawbacks of this remake is the fact that Season One only has three episodes! Initially, I thought this must be due to unfavorable audience response, and that the show was not renewed, but to my delight, it has been renewed for another season with six episodes. I still feel it is not enough, but I'll take what I can get!The setting for this remake of Upstairs, Downstairs is 1936, about six years after the year in which the original series had ended (on film). 165 Eaton Place is literally resurrected, not by a member of the Bellamy clan (the original family that resided there) but by the Holland's, made up of Sir Hallam (Ed Stoppard) who works for the Foreign Office, and his wife, Lady Agnes (Keeley Hawes). They are soon joined by Hallam's eccentric mother, Maud (Eileen Atkins) and Agnes' spoilt younger sister Lady Persie (Claire Foy). Maud pushes her way into the household, bringing along her secretary/manservant Amanjit (Art Malik with a ghastly beard) and her little pet monkey Samson.The staff downstairs are made up of housekeeper, Mrs. Rose Buck (Jean Marsh - yes, from the original Upstairs, Downstairs, where she played the upper house parlour maid, and later ladies' maid); butler Mr. Warrick Pritchard (Adrian Scarborough); chauffeur Spargo (Neil Jackson); cook Mrs. Thackeray (Anne Reid, formerly of Coronation Street); and a housemaid, Ivy (Ellie Kendrick, who played Anne Frank in Masterpiece Theatre: The Diary of Anne Frank). There's also a young footman who appears, goes away, and returns during the first season.The main events in this first season revolve around Lady Agnes trying to take charge of her household, and coming up against her formidable mother-in-law who uses her vast experience as a weapon to override her daughter-in-law's wishes. Not that Lady Agnes tries too hard, given a new development that preoccupies her. Meanwhile, a new maid is brought into the fold, and it turns out she is a Jewess who has escaped from Germany. She appears sickly and harbors a secret that is revealed soon enough.Lady Persie is portrayed as the self-centered, lost soul-type whose reckless nature causes her to not only throw convention to the wind, but also strike up a most inappropriate alliance. She also develops an interest in right-wing activities involving the fascist movement in Britain, a thread that was unfortunately rushed through during the course of the three episodes. Another thread explored this season was the relationship between Wallis Simpson with Edward VIII and the abdication crisis.I liked this first season, but would have liked to see more time spent on developing the main characters. It all seemed a bit rushed, as if the writers and producers were trying to cram as much as they could into the three episodes. I hope to see more time being spent on plot and character development next season.",4,"Still prefer the original, but this updated version has excellent production qualities",1332892800,"03 28, 2012",0.2794
