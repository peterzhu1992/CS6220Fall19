First off, the narration in the beginning is super strange and pretty annoyting. I never looked @ when it was made but I am guessing mid 1980's. On the plus side, the kids loved it. They learned nothing about going potty but it was a good diversion.I have to say, this is one of the weirdest videos I have seen, with the exception of the clip shown on The Soup featuring a french (I assume potty video) of toddlers farting and pooping and getting poop on them",3,A little like a trip to another dimension,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",0.2839
1,A33H0WC9MI8OVW,764127861,Clare Chu,"[10, 10]","I borrowed this video from the library and am glad I did. The actual section for the kids was very short and simple. They go through the basics. The animation is kind of cardboard-like, so don't expect this video to be entertaining or have a storyline. I didn't bother watching the parent's section. However the video must have worked because my son started insisting on the toilet.",3,"Very short and not entertaining, but gets the point across",1059782400,"08 2, 2003",0.1929
2,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,764127861,Dorrie Wheeler,"[2, 2]","I purchased this after hearing both positive and negative things about the video. The video itself is short. Yes, it tells the same story as in the book, but not much more. After the very short potty film their is a pretty useless montage of babies and the potty song. Afterwards, commentary for the parents. It is not useful for young children if you ask me. Once my kids got into the movie itself it was over and I had to rewind--but not too far because the movie itself is so short. The book is better. Some parents have had success with this video. I didn't, but it is short and to the point so some kids might get it.",3,Not Worth It,1076371200,"02 10, 2004",0.0962
3,A3MYTCI0B72ETL,764127861,joeysmom4ever D.,"[52, 60]","A friend gave me this video hoping it would help train my reluctant 3-year-old. While he was very interested in the tape and even bopped to the song, it did not help him overall.One, the children looked younger than 2 years old! So he did not relate on that level and kept referring to the children in the video as babies and cute little babies!Two, the potty used is not the type of potty commonly used in the United States (at least in my opinion.) The part about what a potty is not for became redundant and boring for a child who didn't relate to that what is it? to begin with.Three, the only reference to a true toilet was when Mommy poured the wee-wee into the toilet.On the other hand, I read negative reviews about seeing the 'hole' in the cartoon fanny of Joshua. Well, I want raise my child to know his body parts -- as a child well-versed in their own body and its functions is statistically less likely to be targeted by a sex offender. I didn't think this reference was a big deal, and it even helped me teach my child about that particular body function.I would only recommend this tape to those who are training children in the 1 to 2 year old range and using a similar potty. (It looks like a molded-to-underside bowl.)",2,Not for older potty-trainers,1095638400,"09 20, 2004",0.3064

5,A2ED4OF0BRGNW4,764127861,Lindsey Coddington,"[5, 10]","First of all this video is too short, it shows the same thing over and over and it gets old really fast. Neither me or my son can stand to watch it more than a couple of times. The song is kind of catchy, but it gets old fast too. The potty does look different from any kinds I have seen as well. On another note, it shows it in his diaper when he has gone potty, I mean isn't that a little much? I think its just plain gross and my son probably didn't even know what it was supposed to be anyways. I know one of the reviewers said the kids looked too young but some of them looked too old too. I swear one of the kids in it looks like hes four. I wouldn't waste your money on this video, the repetetive nature of it bores the child too quickly.",1,"Boring, Short and too graphic",1139443200,"02 9, 2006",0.0137
6,A1K06THJVPG35C,764127861,RepublicanMom,"[0, 0]","I bought this because I remember a friend had it for her kids when they were potty training. I do like it and think it's worth no more than what I payed for it, $3.50 shipped. My 2 year old loves it, but it's super short. Really, it's like a 15 minute long movie. Also, it does explain the body and the concept of going potty, but it's a little too discriptive. At one point the little boy bends over and the narrator says he has a little whole for making poo poo. I think it could have been described in a cleaner fashion. The other thing that I've seen others comment about in their reviews is that the kids are not potty training, they're babies. They put the potty's on their heads, ect. Not habits I want my son to learn.",3,Short & too descriptive,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",0.2155
