2,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,767015533,Bruce Rux,"[2, 2]","The concluding black-and-white episodes of the Diana Rigg series had a more than usual tendency to show off her figure to fullest advantage. Such is the case especially with A Sense of History, in which she dresses in a leg-revealing Robin Hood outfit, and A Touch of Brimstone, where she wears next to nothing as the Queen of Sin (and is attacked with a whip, to boot). How To Succeed...At Murder has her in a bodystocking/leotard, practicing ballet for a good portion of the story. And when she isn't dressing down, she's quite the clothes-horse, wearing a gorgeous white pants suit, for instance, in The House That Jack Built, a memorably striking bit of surrealistic sci-fi.Oh, yes - Patrick Macnee is here too, lest we forget that he was the only actor to have starred in every season of the show. And he gets to play dress-up in these episodes, as much as Diana Rigg dresses down.As usual, the interplay between the two is delightfully witty and sparkling, their interaction with numerous flamboyantly unusual villains (and more common thugs) well-choreographed and exciting.",5,Steed Dresses Up - Emma Dresses Down,1020988800,"05 10, 2002",0.0981

Admiration in their eyes, the flash and fire, but all kept quite under control as they function together to stop the evil menace against Britain. I have seen some say this series came about because of the success of the Bond Film, but it was already on the air with theearly episodes, and follow in the trek of Patrick MacGoohan's Danger Man, which turned into Secret Agent (and then into the Prisoner). These seven episodes are still in B&W;, which I think even added to this mysterious ambiance of the episodes. Being able to film in lower light, permits those deep shadows, giving a sinister touch.1) The Murder Market takes Steed and Emma undercover at a marriage bureau, ending with Steed rescuing Emma from being buried alive as she gets too close to the black widows at the center of this evil plot2) A Surfeit of H20 A freak rainstorm drowns locals in the fields. Fearing this is the return of the Great Flood, they villagers have begun building a new Ark. Emma is stylish even in a Mac!3) The Hour That Never Was Steed visits his old RAF airbase in Hamlin.Hours are missing in people's memories, so Steed and Emma must uncover brainwashing saboteurs, threatening England.4) Dial a Deadly Number have Steed and Emma investigating a device called a Bleeper. The Bleeper is designed to help millionaires keep in touch, but an evil doer has set it to reach out and kill.5) Man-Eater of Surrey Green When a outer space artichoke, lands and takes root, and begins killing eminent horticulturists, Emma and Steed get out the Roundup. Rocky and Bullwinkle fought a similar plant in the cartoons - wonder who was first...lol?6) Two's A Crowd Russian agents had let loose a doppelganger for Steed, in order to infiltrate a defense conference7) Too Many Christmas Trees is one of my fav episodes. Steed has been having a strange nightmare, so he welcomes the invitation for Hols in the country at friends. He invites Emma to tag along. They dress up in period costumes, and all seem to have a good time, but Emma begins to suspect Steed's dream is not a dream, but someone trying to control Steed's mine through telepathyJust great fun to have these on DVD.",5,second sets of DVD with Emma Peel,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",-0.1737

The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed's first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed's new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest. These DVD copies are gorgeous and they sound great in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono.",5,Triple Crown,985219200,"03 22, 2001",0.417

This is a set of SEVEN, 52-minute entries from the great and brilliant team of Patrick Macnee (as the aristocratic John Steed) and Diana Rigg (as the tantalizing Emma Peel). The Rigg years were definitely the best ones and there is one other set from 1966 (also with Rigg, it offers SIX episodes) so don't confuse them! All these episodes were shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. Here's a rundown of the episodes:The Danger Makers -- The '60s version of the TV show Jackass! Steed and Peel have to ascertain why these important British officials continue to challenge suicide -- and some succeed! Written by Roger Marshall.A Touch of Brimstone -- This one was banned from American television because Emma Peel dons high-laced boots, a spiked dog collar and a very skimpy outfit! Here, we have The Hellfire Club, hoaxsters, and murder! Written by Brian Clemens.A Sense of History -- It's a battle over economic theory, by medieval Robin Hood types. But these denizens of the woods (and a college campus) don't mind killing those who disagree with their views. This is a superb episode. Written by Martin Woodhouse.How to Succeed... at Murder -- Business executives are being knocked off... by their feminist secretaries?!? The trail leads Steed and Mrs. Peel to an elite perfumery but the ring leader is quite elusive. Written by Brian Clemens.Honey for the Prince -- A Middle-eastern prince on a diplomatic mission is the target for assassination. Steed and Mrs. Peel intervene. Diana Rigg was never HOTTER than she was in this special Bonus Episode. Written by Brian Clemens.What the Butler Saw -- The secret defense plans are stolen! Steed must take on the disguise of a student butler to resolve the mystery. Written by Brian Clemens.The House That Jack Built -- Here, we have a psychological thriller. Mrs. Peel inherits an estate from her Uncle Jack, and is subsequently trapped inside a carnivalistic madhouse. Steed rushes to the rescue. This is a great one. Written by Brian Clemens.I don't know if you get the same deal if you purchase the DVD set -- with the VHS set, you'll get 3 tapes, with two episodes per tape (except on one tape where there's the bonus episode, which makes three episodes on that one), for a total of 7 episodes. The tapes are not copy-protected.There were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they weren't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish. Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply weren't as dynamic as Rigg. Also, the music, action, and story-writing much improved in '65, which is when The Avengers got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time. These black-and-white Macnee-Rigg entries continued through 1966, (it went color after that and Rigg eventually left the series).
