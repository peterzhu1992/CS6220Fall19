0,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,767026225,Andariel Halo Disillusioned Smark,"[3, 5]","I am a great follower of the American Civil War, my interested piqued by the stellar performances of Tom Berenger, Martin Sheen, Stephen Lang, and others in Gettysburg, and I greatly enjoy studying the highly interesting period of history.For the money, this DVD set is certainly a worthwhile piece. However, even made in 1999, it feels inferior to what it could have been.For one, the title is misleading, but the back descriptions openly admit: these documentaries are NOT about the battles, but about specific instances in the battle. So concerned with the individual aspects of each battle is the documentary that it becomes esoteric, and a completely new experience even for someone like me who has studied such battles as Antietam and Gettysburg deeply. The Battle of Shiloh manages to go beyond the Hornet's Nest itself, but the piece on Antietam never leaves the trenches, and the piece on Gettysburg is secured entirely in the wheatfield, to a point of such intense study and devotion that you'd think the Wheatfield was where the core of the battle took place (Hint: it wasn't. It was major, but it was not the decisive battle area).The re-enactments are decent, but inferior. Most of the re-enacting involves men laying around camp, or marching into battle. Typical of cable television documentaries, there's no blood and no violence, with very little emphasis on the actual fighting, and more on men marching, falling dead, and raising their guns to fire at targets never shown on camera. The re-enactment footage, compared to the pictures and interviews, are very hazy, as if done with a lower-quality camera, or under a perpetual veil of dust. Some of the casting, even though only present for a few seconds, are questionable, and their actions appear slightly out of character for the historical person. For example, the extra playing General Longstreet appears too portly, and looks so taken aback by the actions at the Wheatfield that he appears stunned stupid, not exactly the sort of reaction of a Corps Commander.For the price offered by Amazon or its merchants, this is certainly a worthy addition, but I do not recommend it to anyone not a devoted studier of Civil War history, and even then it can appear dry, almost dull, when compared to other documentaries, or movies or books like Gettysburg/The Killer Angels, Gods and Generals, The Last Full Measure, Cold Mountain, etc.",3,Dull and esoteric,1203379200,"02 19, 2008",-0.2043
1,AHCVWPLA1O4X8,767026225,bixodoido,"[40, 42]","This series of four documentaries are different from most Civil War films in that they highlight specific points of four battles, whereas most documentaries are content simply to provide an overview of the battle itself. Because of this, each episode contains many little-known facts about the battles of Antietam, Cold Harbor, Shiloh, and Gettysburg. And, at an hour long (more or less), they are not excessively long.The highlights from each of the battles are interesting, but probably only so for someone interested in the war. Watching an hour-long reenactment of the wheat field at Gettysburg is probably meaningless without at least some appreciation of what was happening at the other parts of the battle. Anyone who studies the Civil War closely will appreciate these little-known facts, but casual viewers may find it a bit much.In addition to its narrow scope, these four documentaries are riddled with errors that should have been obvious to the folks at the History Channel. For example, saying General Grant was in charge of the Union Army at Gettysburg is just plain false, as any amateur historian should know. These erroes detract much from the reliability of the accounts.Despite these two setbacks, this is a noteworthy documentary, worth your time at least to check it out.",3,A unique approach to Civil War documentary,1040947200,"12 27, 2002",-0.2244
2,A1JH5J1KQAUBMP,767026225,David Bonesteel,"[1, 1]","Four of the most costly battles of the Civil War are analyzed by historians and recreated by Civil War reenactors. Because I don't have a particular interest in this period of our history, I really didn't expect much from this series; I thought it would be little more than a dry, bare bones production for basic cable. While it certainly can't match Ken Burns's classic documentary, it did hold my interest. This is a thoughtful effort that spends as much time on personal narratives that show what the battle must have been like from the perspective of the foot soldier as it does on more abstract points of tactics and strategy. The reenactors do a fine job, as does the production crew, resulting in a thoroughly engrossing program.",4,An engrossing history lesson,1239494400,"04 12, 2009",0.1549

4,A20JYIHL1W1U54,767026225,hille2000 hille2000,"[13, 13]","Civil War Combat is an excellent and absorbing production from the HISTORY CHANNEL. This DVD focuses on 4 engagements: Shiloh, Antietam, Gettysburg and Cold Harbor. Reenactors provide the images while historians and rangers from the National Park Service describe the men and the events from the overall strategies down to personal accounts of the average soldier. I believe that all the photography is actually shot at the National Military Park locations. The photography is really beautiful. This is no cheap production. If you like the way the HISTORY CHANNEL produces their shows you should really like this set. I enjoyed the Cold Harbor segment the best. It was really interesting and informative.",5,A Very Good Production,992476800,"06 14, 2001",0.226
5,A1H3YRJR5N8A9W,767026225,J. C. Darling,"[6, 6]","I have not actually purchased this DVD, but I watched every episode of Civil War Combat when The History Channel was airing them for the first time several years back.Each episode of Civil War Combat focuses on a particular story within the larger framework of some of the war's major battles. For example, there are episodes centering on The Wheat Field (Gettysburg), The Sunken Road (Antietam), The Hornet's Nest (Shiloh), and the futile Union charges at Cold Harbor. Going even deeper, each scenario centers on a particular unit or brigade (both Union and Confederate) - with particular attention to a key colonel, or Brigade commander, or a Private soldier - that fought in these particular areas of the battlefields. By doing this, the viewer is placed in the shoes of the rank and file and is given a pretty good sense of the desperate figting that ocurred and what these men were experiencing.The one negative I have to mention regarding these presentations is that the producers clearly could not amass the necessary body count of reenactors to accurately portray the numbers of troops involved. For example, in The Gettyburg Wheat Field episode, you see a small platoon of Union troops advancing across the field, where they were depicting an entire regiment or brigade. Fighting would be over in a few seconds with such a paltry command taking part in such an attack. So, even though these productions are excellent, the number of troops represented is far from accurate... almost ludicrous.I have not heard of or seen any new episodes of Civil War Combat in a long while. I'd like to see more episodes in the future. Some scenarios I can think of that I wish were covered originally in the series would be Gettysburg - McPherson's Ridge focusing on the Union 1st Corps' (with particular focus on The Iron Brigade) defense of the ridge on July 1st. Also, Antietam - The Cornfield focusing on - again - either the Iron Brigade's clash with the 1st Texas, or one of the other many regiments that took control and/or lost control of that sector of the battlefield.Definitely worth adding to your Civil War DVD collection - whether you're an old Civil War buff, or a fledgling buff. I may have to buy these myself real soon.",4,Excellent productions from The History Channel,1160265600,"10 8, 2006",-0.2407

7,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,767026225,magellan,"[3, 3]","Having had a chance to visit several Civil War battlefields on a trip east (Gettysburg, Antietam, and Manassas) and take the tours, that sparked an interest in learning more about the history, and I started watching this series and bought a couple of standard books on the subject. As a newcomer to detailed Civil War history, the series was fine as an introduction. More informed reviewers would probably find it too basic, but then I'm a beginner. The re-enactments are dramatic and very realistic in recreating the most important events of these battles, sometimes using what appears to be thousands of participants, dozens of canons, and in some cases men are thrown into the air from explosions nearby, doing somersaults and what not, making me wonder if some of the re-enactors had stunt man abilities. I found these recreations of several of the most important battles very informative and enjoyable to watch, I just wish there was a set where you could get all of the battles. I've seen at least 14 battles on the History Channel, but for some reason only a few of these are included in these sets. That's the reason for the four instead of five stars. Overall a fine series, especially for the neophyte who wants to get his feet wet.",4,Exciting re-enactments,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",-0.0245

9,A1GZKHEQWTS4Z5,767026225,Thomas Moody,"[68, 68]","The premise with this History Channel series is to tell specific battle history while showing (through re-enactment) what the engagements really looked like...and this DVD set hits the ball right out of the park! Watching the battles at Antietam, Gettysburg, Shiloh and (my favorite) Cold Harbor on the actual battlefield is phenominal...it really adds so much to the narration that you actually get the &quot;feel&quot; of being right in the middle of the conflict. Each battle covers sufficient detail that the story of the &quot;everyday&quot; soldier gets told along with much &quot;new&quot; information that makes this DVD unique (for example...on the Fredricksburg episode, the little known story of the Confederate private who risks life and limb by going onto the battlefield to help the injured is a featured part of the story but these are details that I couldn't find in books from Foote, Catton or the excellent volume on Fredricksburg by George Rable). The narration also includes &quot;expert&quot; analysis from noted historians and authors (Gordon Rhea in the trenches at Cold Harbor...) that add additional perspective to the storyline. The battle stories are about 1 hour long and each stands on it's own so that you can stop at reasonable intervals without missing anything. Overall this is essential Civil War viewing for the historian but still presents itself well enough for the general viewer so that all viewers should get great enjoyment from watching...highest recommendation!",5,Civil War battle history comes to life...,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",0.0097
10,A35KD1U1M387I0,767026225,Todd E. Newman,"[25, 25]","The Civil War Combat DVD set is probably by far the best reeanactment/documentary on four different battles that raged throughout 1861 to 1864. The historical accuracy and care to details given captures the importance of such warfare that took place at Shiloh, Antietam, Gettysburg (Wheatfield) and Cold Harbor. There isn't anything closer to the real action as reeanactors are used for the production and isn't shy on showing blood. This 2-DVD production isn't a Gettysburg that shows clean fighting or lacks the details commonly found in movie productions. Crank up the surround sound while viewing these great reeactments as bullets whiz by often and place the viewer right on the field. Soldier accounts of the action is backed by narratives which enhance this great production. The History Channel that has put this set together has definately contributed to telling the tales of four battles which had strong impacts on the war. It can't be told any better! This 2-DVD set is a must have for anyone interested in the Civil War. Nothing like this has ever been done to accurately portray such actions before. It's certainly worth every penny!",5,Worth every penny!!,1016064000,"03 14, 2002",0.1213
