This film takes me back to my childhood i await it every year with baited breath for the special to come on around christmas time just to hear one single song! When that damn little elf breaks into that &quot;Misfit&quot; song I just get all warm inside! It's the pefect example of every kids childhood and at one time or another everybody feels out of place! But the film has a lot going for it besides the amazing soundtrack it has Burl Ives! His warm, deep father like voice is just so comforting to hear! The jokes seem even more funnier as I have gotten older and alot more crass than when you were little this film has to be owned by everyone who thinks back to being a kid and loving christmas time.

12,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,307514161,Britt Gillette thedvdreport.blogspot.com,"[0, 0]","One of a plethora of animated Christmas classics created in the 1960's - A Charlie Brown Christmas (1965) and How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1966) come to mind - this rendition of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is unique in that it uses stop-motion animation instead of cartoons to tell its story. Sam the Snowman (voiced by Burl Ives) brilliantly narrates the tale of an awkward reindeer and his struggle with discrimination. Along the way, he sings a number of holiday classics such as Silver and Gold, Holly Jolly Christmas, and of course - Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.The story begins when Rudolph's father, Donner, tries to cover up his son's shiny, bright red nose with a disguise. When Rudolph attends a flight training school for young reindeer, he encounters Clarice - a young doe who thinks that Rudolph is cute. This revelation causes Rudolph to leap into the air and fly around the sky like a seasoned aviator. But when he lands, the nose disguise falls off and Rudolph's red honker is exposed to the scorn and ridicule of the young bucks in flight school. Clarice is the only one who doesn't view Rudolph as an outcast freak, but her father quickly escorts her out of the presence of such a monster.Following this episode, Rudolph runs away only to meet up with an outcast Elf named Hermey who has committed the unforgivable sin of not wanting to make toys. Contrary to the social conventions of his time, Hermey wants to be a dentist. Feeling unwanted, Rudolph and Hermey decide to run away together. But in due time, they encounter the dangerous Abominable Snow Monster - a giant, hairy beast who crushes anyone who leaves Christmastown. Aiding in their rescue is Yukon Cornelius, a burly prospector who chops off a piece of ice with his pick ax, allowing Rudolph, Hermey, and himself to float away from the Abominable Snow Monster (who can't swim).After floating through the night, the three characters discover The Land of Misfit Toys - an island of handicapped, screwed-up toys rejected by elf quality-control managers and forced to live away their best years in an icy wasteland. Our three heroes can relate to the misfit toys, and Rudolph promises to inform Santa of their status the next time he sees him.When Rudolph sneaks away in the middle to return home, he meets up with Clarice (who ran away from home to search for him), and the two of them get cornered by the Abominable Snow Monster. But Yukon Cornelius faces down the Monster, and together with Hermey, he coaxes the beast into a trap - where Hermey neutralizes the Monster by pulling out his teeth.Meanwhile, Christmastown is covered with a thick fog, and Santa ponders the cancellation of Christmas. But when he sees Rudolph's bright red nose glowing in his workshop, Santa asks Rudolph to guide his sleigh through the night. With Rudolph taking the lead, Santa swoops down on Christmas Eve just in time to rescue the depressed residents of The Land of Misfit Toys and deliver them all to expectant boys and girls who will love them for who they are.This breakthrough Claymation classic is essential for any child's Christmas experience (and that of adults who grew up watching much-anticipated annual holiday special on TV). That's why this ranks as a definite must-see by any standard. But undoubtedly, we all owe a special thanks to Montgomery Ward - the giant retail chain that created Rudolph as part of a promotional gimmick one fabled Christmas season decades ago.

The warmth and purpose of the holiday extends to those who consider themselves unloved and outcast misfits.While the show might seem like a random series of nonsequitur adventures, they are all woven together by this overarching theme. The entire show is rightly regarded as a classic, and not just because it was made so many years ago. Musically, visually, thematically: it all hangs together.I'm telling you, it's never been outclassed.",5,best there ever was,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",0.4052
15,A35XUI9HGMAJEX,307514161,Carlisle Wheeling,"[1, 1]","Always a great holiday classic, this special strikes a chord with anyone who has ever been rejected for being different and longs for acceptance on their own terms. I should know, having been picked on most of my life for having undiagnosed ADD. Rudolph is the son of the famous Donnar, who is ashamed to find out his son has a red shiny nose that glows and gives off a horrific, wailing beep, so he tries to hide it by packing mud over it when a visiting, arrogant Santa disapproves. Well, shame on Santa, and shame on the others--especially the reindeer clique--who picked on him. They don't even take into consideration how well he can fly, or that he is a good person with a good heart. All they see is his nose. Fortunately, like any misfit, Rudolph has some allies in his mother, Clarice, Ukorn Cornelius, and Herbie the elf--a veritable misfit himself in Santa's workshop--who wants to be a...a dentist.Due to lack of acceptance, Rudolph and Herbie set off on their own to find their special calling, and meet up with gold prospector Ukorn and his pack of sled dogs. Ukorn knows no fear, and is the only one who isn't afraid of the Abominable Snowman. PCers lighten up! Herbie removing his teeth was better than killing him, and the Abominable was indiscriminate about where he got his lunch. Was Herbie removing his teeth awful in comparison? I think not.The group lands on the Island of Misfit toys, ruled by a great and kindly lion king who wants Santa to find homes for them, and rightly so. Everyone wants to be accepted and loved for who they are, don't they? That is the lesson in this wonderful yuletide story for young and old alike, and it always puts most of us in the Christmas mood. Did you ever notice how people are more accepting of those who are different around the holidays, and then they revert back to the way they treated them previously? This story is about how anyone can change--even the bumble--that acceptance is a worldwide theme, and that's what the lesson is in this wonderful old classic. It doesn't mean you should only make exceptions on the holidays, however, but you should be accepting all year long. The spirit of Christmas should last throughout the year in kindness and tolerance of difference, which makes this appropriate for children of all ages. It's a great lesson full of good old classic songs, and Burl Ives makes a great snowman narrator.It's obvious Rankin Bass put a lot of care into this one, and I also recommend Santa Claus is Comin' to Town along with it. They don't make specials like this anymore, and I know 3/4 of the dialog due to repeated watching! Good old Christmas classics never go out of style when they're done right, and that's the reason adults still love to watch this one with their kids. Pass this one on to your kids and emphasize the lesson here about being generous to your fellow man and animal. Also, have a happy holiday!Dedicated to the memory of my late brother Mark, who always loved this when we were kids and beyond.Sincerely, Carlisle.",5,Did I Ever Tell You About Bumbles?

21,A2O7XXGIOYVR8R,307514161,cousinpaco,"[0, 0]","Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer sends a Christmas message of acceptance, individuality, and the value of friendship. At least, it does after the last five minutes, when Rudolph saves everyone's butts from...er...fog.The story begins when Rudolph is born. To his parents' horror, he has a flashing red nose. When Santa, the cruel despot of Christmastown (seriously -- in this show, he's a jerk), makes no attempt to hide his disgust, Rudolph's father, Donner, displays some dubious parenting techniques by forcing the young deer to disguise his luminous snout. Unfortunately, Rudolph's shameful deformity is discovered by the other young reindeer, who laugh and call him names. One of these cretins is named Fireball - he's got a single wisp of blond hair and freckles, so he really shouldn't be one to talk.When Rudolph is cast out from Christmastown, he meets some new friends:Hermey - a toy-hating elf with an oral fixation, and a finger-wave hairdo that would make Conan O'Brien jealous. Hermey loses his job because he wants to live an alternate lifestyle. How PC.Yukon Cornelius - a burly prospector seeking to increase his personal wealth. Interestingly, he carries a gun. Yukon helps Rudolph defeat a giant snow-monster. The monster (who is white) represents The Man, crushing anyone who does not bow to conformity (by staying safely in Christmastown).Misfit Toys - a bunch of toys that nobody wants: a boat that doesn't float, a train with square wheels, a squirt-gun filled with jelly, etc. Frankly, I think Santa's workshop needs better Quality Control, if they're turning out junk like this. Besides, I can think of a few seventh graders who could make the most of a jelly-gun.Clarice - a doe-eyed...well...doe, with Revlon lashes and a bow in her hair. She's lovely and tolerant, and the most under-developed character in the story.While this enchanting tale is a family-favorite it fails as an origin story, neglecting to explain why Rudolph's nose glows. It's obviously a genetic mutation, but we never learn the mechanism behind it. Does it give off heat? Why does it make that feeble whistling sound? Is it any more horrifying than the fact that Santa can go from skinny to fat in the course of one day?It's also disconcerting that, by story's end, Rudolph has reached maturity (with tall, pointed antlers), but his voice has not changed. Perhaps reindeer puberty is unpredictable, but Rudolph is the only adult male who doesn't sound like J. Jonah Jameson.Still, I recommend this Claymation Classic for anyone. Despite the flaws, it just wouldn't be Christmas without Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!",5,Going down in history...,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",-0.0312
22,A1FDW1SPYKB354,307514161,David Von Pein,"[14, 14]","First televised on NBC-TV on Sunday, December 6, 1964 (but usually associated with CBS-TV due to that network's many airings of the program throughout the succeeding years), the animated color TV Special &#34;Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer&#34; has now turned forty years of age (as of this writing), and has endured for all those years as an annual staple in many American homes.The DVD edition I'm reviewing here is the one issued by &#34;Sony Wonder&#34; and &#34;Golden Books Family Entertainment&#34; (1-Disc version). It provides a very good-looking Full Frame (1.33:1) video image of the perennial &#34;Rudolph&#34; Christmas Special; with a Dolby Digital soundtrack recorded in 2-channel (original) Mono.This particular version of &#34;Rudolph&#34; is quite unique actually, in that it is the &#34;unaltered&#34; version of the TV Special, as it aired originally in 1964. Which means that one song which has been routinely cut out of subsequent broadcasts of the program is presented uncut within this DVD version. That song being &#34;We're A Couple Of Misfits&#34;, sung by Rudolph and dentist-to-be &#34;Hermey&#34; near the beginning of the show. This song was replaced in 1965 with the &#34;Fame And Fortune&#34; song instead.The alternate song used in that scene (&#34;Fame And Fortune&#34;) is included, however, as a separate Bonus Feature on this DVD. .... To tell you the truth, I prefer the &#34;Fame & Fortune&#34; number to the original &#34;Misfits&#34; tune. And I can see why the producers of the Special decided to make the switch during the second broadcast of the program in 1965. &#34;F&F;&#34; is a better ditty, IMO. And, obviously, others thought so as well. Hence, the substitution.This DVD contains the complete, uncut version of &#34;Rudolph&#34; (with a total run time of 51 minutes, 32 seconds). This is significant (and most welcome), because after the first few broadcasts on network TV, as we all know, many cuts and edits were made to the original print, so that more and more commercials could be jammed into the one-hour network timeslot over the years. It's doubtful we'll ever encounter this original &#34;51-minute&#34; version on network television again, due to the ever-increasing sponsors' demands for prime-time air time.All of the rarely-seen snippets of the &#34;Rudolph&#34; Special are re-inserted into this full-length DVD version -- clips like: the &#34;Peppermint&#34; scene at the tail-end of the special, where Yukon Cornelius discovers &#34;a peppermint mine! Yahooo!&#34; .... And: the complete musical numbers (&#34;Jingle, Jingle, Jingle!&#34; and &#34;We Are Santa's Elves&#34;) are fully intact on the DVD; whereas, in many chopped-up prints, one (or both) of these songs have either been severely truncated or cut out entirely. It's nice to be able to see the &#34;whole&#34; show via this nicely-done &#34;Sony&#34; DVD release.This disc has a few nice add-on bonus supplements, too. In addition to the aforementioned bonus song (&#34;Fame And Fortune&#34;), there's also a Rudolph trivia game, an original TV promo, some ads for other &#34;Golden Books&#34; holiday DVD titles, and a fun and informative 11-minute &#34;introduction&#34; by producer/creator Arthur Rankin.In addition, you can access English Subtitles in two different ways on this disc -- there are the traditional &#34;captions&#34;/(subtitles) that can be turned on at the bottom of the screen. Plus, this DVD offers what is called &#34;Read-Speak Action Captions&#34;, which show the words on the screen in a unique, 3-D kind of fashion, displaying the words in large print right beside the mouths of each character speaking, one word at a time. An interesting alternative to the normal captioning process.Chapter breaks are also included on this disc, with a whopping total of 27 &#34;Scene Selections&#34;! My goodness, some three-hour movie DVDs don't have this many Chapter Stops! :) combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt = NOTE: The &#34;Read-Speak&#34; Captioned version of &#34;Rudolph&#34; (which can be accessed via the Bonus Features area) does not have any &#34;Chapter&#34; breaks included.An added word or two about the &#34;TV Promo&#34; on this disc --- This is a nice little bonus, which runs for 59 seconds and exhibits very good color and overall picture quality. It's an original 1966 NBC-TV promo that informs the viewers that &#34;Rudolph is coming on Sunday, December 4th, on the General Electric Fantasy Hour&#34; program.A word about the DVD Menus ..... I'm not a big fan of &#34;Animated Menus&#34; on DVDs, but this disc's Menu system is an exception. For some reason, I really like these Menus, which offer up cheery music and cute animated sequences. The Main Menu puts the viewer right into the Christmas spirit, featuring falling snow, a decorated Christmas tree, and &#34;Rudolph&#34; looking skyward, complete with batting eyelids and a bright glowing nose. While the various Sub-Menus also have animated moving pictures and a &#34;falling snow&#34; background as well. Each Sub-Menu features a different character from the &#34;Rudolph&#34; Special.Some additional &#34;Rudolph&#34; Notes and Trivia and Miscellaneous Ramblings :-) ..................&#62;&#62; The voice talent for &#34;Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer&#34; was supplied by Burl Ives (Narrator/&#34;Sam&#34;), Billie Mae Richards (&#34;Rudolph&#34;), Paul Soles (&#34;Hermey&#34;), Larry Mann (&#34;Yukon&#34;), and Alfie Scopp (&#34;Head Elf&#34;).&#62;&#62; I hadn't realized this trivial tidbit until recently ...... Comet (the reindeer coach) was voiced by Don Adams (of &#34;Get Smart&#34; TV fame).&#62;&#62; I've often wondered how many little kids who have watched this &#34;Rudolph&#34; Special were suddenly scared to death that Christmas might be &#34;cancelled&#34; (as feared in the show due to foul weather). LOL!&#62;&#62; Has anyone (besides me) ever noticed with amusement that the gruff voice of the &#34;Head Elf&#34; dramatically changes, somehow, just before he begins to direct his &#34;Elf Chorus&#34; in the song &#34;We Are Santa's Elves&#34;? Throughout the majority of the show, Mr. Head Elf is the very coarse-sounding 'meanie' -- when he dishes out some of my favorite lines from the show, such as: &#34;Now you come to Elf Practice and learn how to wiggle your ears, and chuckle warmly, and go &#34;hehe&#34; and &#34;hoho&#34;, and important stuff like that! A dentist! Good grief!&#34; .... And yet, in the &#34;chorus&#34; scene, his voice changes completely. He sounds a bit wimpish when he utters: &#34;Now let's try out the new elf song I wrote; and remember, it's for Santa.&#34; (LOL!) This sudden and drastic vocal-cord switch always cracks me up when I watch this program.------------------------------The &#34;Rudolph&#34; TV Special is truly an American tradition. A must-see each December. And now, via this nice uncut DVD edition, the adventures of our antlered hero with the crimson-colored snoot should remain crystal-clear and in pristine condition forever.",5,Never Be Late For Elf Practice Again -- Thanks To This DVD!,1104019200,"12 26, 2004",0.3938

Rudolph leaves Christmastown with another misfit, an elf named Hermy, who wants to be a dentist rather than make toys. The pair team up with Yukon Cornelius, a wacky but savy prospector, to explore the Great North. The trio will dodge the Abomidable Snowman and find the Island of Misfit Toys. It will take a family crisis to bring them back to Christmastown, just in time for a big blizzard and a chance to save Christmas...Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has lost none of its charm and wisdom through an annual retelling.

Its sense of history, and sly use of metaphor, are unrivaled among holiday specials. Santa is a case in point: the brash young rebel of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town has aged, like so many real-life revolutionaries, into a complacent, jackbooted despot. He has mislaid the flame of revolution, which is now in the hands (or rather the nose) of young Rudolph.To some degree, the tale is predictable, with a familiar set-up. A rebel-hero requires that the status quo (or ruling party) be, if not evil, then extremely jaded and misguided. Santa, the tyrant of Christmas Town, who has Castro's beard and pomposity, has built an austere, Walachia-like kingdom on the sweatshop labor of elves in the unregulated North. He seems the ideal villain-a capitalist straw man from a Socialist tract-and you eagerly await his downfall.Of course, Jolly Saint Nick can never be deposed. As a young man, he once swept the Burghermeister into the flames like so much tinsel, but in the centuries since he has become the face of a nation and seems destined to fade, like Castro, into white hairs and senility. Thus, the tension-how will they resolve it?Rudolph, shunned in his homeland, reaches maturity (like the prophets of old) on the howling wastes, where he regards the hollowness of Santa's regime. Like Simon in Lord of the Flies, he realizes that the Abominable (the State bogeyman) is, in reality, just some harmless bugaboo, the product and victim of government hype. In a stirring climax, Rudolph the Red, assisted by an inner circle of misfits and weirdoes (including the defanged Abominable), returns to Christmas Town to confront Santa. He knows that the old regime, beset by storms and malaise, is doomed. What follows demonstrates his tactical genius: the venerable Santa will become the Revolution's impotent figurehead; Rudolph, its scorching beacon. The old king, recalling the glory of his own Putsch, hands the reins of power to the young firebrand, who quickly liberates the deformed misfit inmates of a floating Bastille (imprisoned for their own good by an imperious, leonine, eagle-winged warden) and unleashes them on society.

But when he meets Hermey, and outcast elf, and Yukon Cornelius, they escape from Christmastown, and the ridicule, and, while trying to avoid the Bumble (the Abominable Snow Monster), the three friends come across the Island of Misfit Toys, where they meet many toys who are looking for a person to love them. But one year, when Christmas has been officially cancelled, and Santa Claus can't find a way to guide his sleigh through the blizzard, Rudolph returns to Christmastown, where Santa Claus calls upon him to guide his sleigh, and where he becomes a world-renown hero.For everyone who has sung the song, the official story, and movie, is here. Fans young and old will relish in the exact similarities between the song and the movie; and the sweet relationship that Rudolph develops with his friends Hermey the Elf, Yukon Corenlius, and even the Bumble.

Taylor GFT,"[1, 1]","Founded in 1960 by Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass, Rankin/Bass followed in the footsteps of such stop-motion animators as Ray Harryhousen--but with less budget. Although the company made quite a few feature films over the years, with the 1967 THE MAD MONSTER PARTY probably the best known, they were most famous for their seasonal television specials. These included the 1964 RUDOLPH THE RED NOSED REINDEER, which has been televised on network television every year at Christmas since its debut.Obviously inspired by the song by the 1939 song, the story veers in several creative directions. Not only does Rudolph have a glowing red nose, his father attempts to conceal it, and even Santa rejects Rudolph because of it. This story line is combined with the tale of elf Hermey, who dislikes making toys and wants to be a dentist. Rejected for who they are, Rudolph and Hermey flee the north pole--and eventually stumble upon the Island of Misfit Toys, where unwanted toys are gathered and will remain until some little girl or boy actually wants one of them. Still later, the pair encounter Yukon Cornelius, who helps them defeat the Bumble, a version of the abominable snowman. Rudolph and Hermey return home, where both now find acceptance; Yukon Cornelius joins them, leading the Bumble, who he has converted into a helpful beast. When a violent snow storm threatens to postpone Christmas, Rudolph uses his nose to light Santa's way, and after a quick stop to pick up the misfit toys for a happily-ever-after Christmas delivery, Santa is on his way.The stop-motion is hardly on the same level as that of KING KONG or EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS, but it has a certain innocent charm, and the puppets are truly smile inducing. The show also includes a number of truly enjoyable Christmas songs, two of which are performed by Burl Ives as the narrating snowman and which went on to a broader popularity: Holly Jolly Christmas and Sliver and Gold. The DVD release is not pristine, but it is extremely good, and children of all ages will enjoy the show.

Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer was made in 1964 and I'm sure everything in it seemed perfectly acceptable back then, but by current standards, there are so many politically-incorrect aspects to this film that it is laughable. For example, all of the reindeers on Santa's sleigh are male and the sole purpose of the female reindeer is to stand around and look pretty; or my favourite part, at two points in the film, Mrs Claus tells Santa to eat more because children don't want a skinny Santa.Having said all of that, I do like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer very much. I saw this film many times as a child and loved it then (and no, I didn't end up becoming overweight nor did I end up believing that females are incapable of doing anything useful in life), and as a 27 year old, I still think that Rudolph is one of the cutest Christmas films there is. Songs abound throughout this film, and as a result, it may seem a bit slow-moving for this generation's children, but there are many far-worse Christmas shows out there.

Still the all-time champ, Rudolph is the longest-running holiday special in television history, running annually since 1964, mostly on CBS and NBC. You can get hung up on the modest scope of the stop-motion Animagic figures, elemental sets and limited effects, but you can't deny its power. There is simply an engaging quality about the production that charms every generation, regardless of how high-tech things become. Production designer Anthony Peters deserves more attention for his creations, which we see almost everywhere today -- even the lettering is widely imitated.At its core, the story is about being different, and how those differences become strengths. For a show aimed at children's, the characters can be downright cruel (this particular Santa, besides appearing to have an eating disorder, shows such displeasure he'd be right at home sitting next to Donald Trump on The Apprentice).If you view the special in its historic context, during the civil rights movement, suddenly Rudolph is a victim of prejudice -- Clarice's father won't let his daughter be seen with him. Maybe that's reading too much into the story, but it makes one wonder if some members of '60s households realized they were watching or just dismissed it as a cute kid's show. Probably the latter.As a cultural icon, you can't dismiss the influence this single special had on so much that followed it. Many of today's greatest names in animation have either cited it as a favorite (along with other Rankin/Bass films) or slipped its lore into their own work. Like The Wizard of Oz, elements of Romeo Muller's script have become part of our vernacular, from Charlie in the Box to Hermie the Dentist.On Blu-ray, of course you can see the handmade quality of the animation in all its glory -- as well as details you may have missed, like Clarice's touch of blush or Fireball's freckles. AND, the long-omitted Peppermint mine scene has been included. If you've ever wondered if there was more to Yukon Cornelius' quest for riches, you'll see it just before Santa goes off to pick up the misfit toys.For more about Rankin/Bass and Rudolph, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Rudolph, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.",4,"Rudolph, the Blu-ray Reindeer",1322352000,"11 27, 2011",0.4797

(Less well known--if not totally UNKNOWN--at that time would have been the orignial 1939 story by Robert L. May.) Nowadays, of course, kids grow up with both the song and the now annually broadcast special and probably don't really have an inkling of the history of the tale.But literal minded kid that I was, I remember being a little perplexed that Rudolph's father was DONNER in the animated version. Everything else I'd ever read (including the annual comic book edtions) suggested that Rudolph and Donner were simply, well, TEAMmates--and contemporaries. I recall, as well, having some ambivalence about the Hermey subplot. Yes, it drove home the misfit theme of the story by providing Rudolph with an actual friend and kindred spirit, but, I mean, c'mon, an elf who wants to be a DENTIST?? Shouldn't they just be magically protected from something as mundane as tooth decay to begin with?But like most 60s kids, I was still kinda taken with the production, whatever my reservations. However you tell it, the RUDOLPH saga is a classic Ugly Duckling story, a genre just about every kid identifies with on some level. (Who doesn't feel misunderstood and unappreciated?) And in an era when anti-bullying messages are proliferating (and, I sincerely hope, are being heard), it does a body good to remember one such classic tale from an earlier era.Some kids may be taken aback to learn that, in this version, even Santa is insensitive (AND, oddly enough, kinda SKINNY most of the time, 'til Mrs. Claus fattens him up anyway). Santa's initial reaction is to dismiss Rudolph as a potential drafts-reindeer, and rather summarily at that. But even in the original song, come to think of it, there's no indication that Santa's interest in Rudolph is anything but utilitarian. You never saw him scolding the other reindeer for not letting poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games. If it hadn't been for that foggy Christmas Eve...I've often wondered if the stop motion animation of this version of RUDOLPH might not seem too primitive and awkward for the current crop of tykes out there, weaned as they are on whizzbang computer generated special effects. Well, a few years ago, I watched the DVD with my niece and nephew, and they were captivated with it. That was heartening, RUDOLPH is a warm-hearted, compassionate tale.

In fact, I looked forward to seeing it on TV even as an adult!Wanting to share this great classic with my 7 year old son, I bought it for him a few weeks ago. Sure, I had it recorded on a VHS along with other Christmas classics, but the quality wasn't that great and we had to endure commercials.The DVD version seems to be cleaned up from the TV version in terms of quality. I seem to recall more background fuzzies when it was on TV (perhaps the DVD was re-mastered?)The Desinty's Child claymation video is basically worthless, in my opinion, unless you have a little fan of this kind of music (and I don't).With a run-time of 65 minutes, this DVD has hardly any extras. There's a lost scene which originally aired in place of the song Why Am I Such A Misfit? (an optimistic tune about striking out and finding your fortune). You can also view the DVD in Spanish, and my son gets a kick out of doing that once in awhile.The previews for other DVD's--including an annoying promo for one about Peter Rabbit/Easter--seems ENDLESS. It's a shame how they advertise to death on DVD's for youngsters!And as far as the Rudolph story: well, I was always bothered that Rudolph's Dad rejected him for being different--as well as Santa himself! Very disappointing, but isn't that like life--where people judge based on appearances?Still, I love the songs on Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, and Hermie the dentist wanna-be, Yukon Cornelius and the Bumble bring warm holiday nostalgia to our house. And my 7 year old son plays this DVD at least once a day! What more can you ask for? (except maybe some fun extras).",4,Great Memories!,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",0.0589

There's something especially touching in the craft behind the images: you can feel the resonance from the touch of each person who posed these figure, frame after frame.A beautiful story, a wonderful early-60s design aesthetic and a talented group of voice actors make this feel as important today as it did when I first saw it in 1964.This edition features a reconstructed broadcast version, including all the original scenes, plus additional material added a few years later. Most importantly, it restores the original We're A Couple of Misfits song to its proper place.

Pouliot,"[3, 3]","The unsurpassed Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer has it all -- innocence and menace, a coming-of age story, a riveting plot, terrific voicing and immortal songs by Johnny Marks.Released in 1964, Rudolph captured the issues of the black heart at the center of the bland conformity of the 1950s. In that age, those who were a little bit different did not fit in -- not to mention those who were a lot different! Neither does the film spare depicting less than admirable traits in beloved characters. It is most shocking to see Rudolph being oppressed, not only by his status-minded father Donner but by Santa himself!Rudolph continues to mesmerize because of its adorable cast of characters - including Herbie the Dentist, lovable Clarise, Yukon Cornelius, the Abominable, the Charley-in-the-box and a host of others. But its world-weary air, thanks to Burl Ives's voicing of Sam the Snowman, removes it from the realm of saccharin holiday tales. It would take a cold heart indeed to watch the story of the misfit toys and remain unmoved.Rudolph is a tale of social conformity, rejection, single-minded determination and eventual redemption and social reintegration. It is these large themes -- not the cuteness of the animals or colorful sets--that make the story a perennial favorite. But the animation almost steals the show. Every tiny bird and squirrel is lovingly crafted and animated. And Johnny Marks' tunes - Silver and Gold, There's Always Tomorrow I Am Not Just a Misfit and We are Santa's Elves among them - each add their own luster to the gleaming, heart-shaped Christmas ornament that is Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer. If you don't find yourself singing these adorable songs at odd times during the year, it's time for a rewatching!A must-have for any home!

May ... originally for a coloring book (for the kids) ... that accompanied the Montgomery Ward Christmas catalog of that year (1939). The song Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer was later (1949) written by Robert L. May's brother-in-law ... Johnny Marks ... and recorded (reluctantly) by Gene Autry.The first animated film Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer was a Max Fleischer cartoon of about 1951. In that one, Rudolph lives in a reindeer village far from the North Pole, and is discovered sleeping by Santa ... who wakes Rudolph and asks him to help. Rudolph saves the day, and is later honored in a stadium (in his home town) and named Commander in Chief.This version (the Johnny Marks one here) is about a hundred times better. I love the puppets here ... though they must have required a lot of work (and about a million photos) ... but it is the story that, I believe, captures our hearts.The credit for that (the story) goes to Mr. May, but also to a guy named Romeo Muller ... who filled out and embellished the original tale for this, the 1964 made-for-television movie.Having Rudolph be a heartbroken misfit ... who prevails ... is an excellent lesson for many of us who were (and are) in the same predicament as kids... and adding in Hermey and Clarice and Yukon Cornelius (and even the snow monster) ... just makes it a wonderful and meaningful story.And the songs are very excellent.

But where the 1964 production from Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr. achieved greatness was in the creativeness it showed with the supporting cast. The story is narrated by Sam the Snowman, voiced by Burl Ives (who sang the second most popular version of the song after Gene Autry's orignal), and Rudolph (Billie Mae Richards) becomes friends with both Hermey (Paul Soles), the elf who marches to his own drummer, and Yukon Cornelius (Larry D. Mann), the prospector. However, the most unforgettable characters in this story are the toys from the Island of Misfit Toys: Charlie-in-the-Box, the Spotted Elephant, and the others, along with their leader, King Moonracer.The result is a much deeper version of the story than was even hinted at in the lyrics of Johnny Marks' classic Christmas song. We all now how the story is going to end on that foggy Christmas eve, so it is everything leading up to that fateful night that is where this story gets its deserved reputation as Rudolph is not the only one who ends up having their life take a turn for the better, as even the Abominable Snowman finds he can put the finishing touches on a perfect Christmas. Besides, how often does a dentist get to be the hero in a Christmas story?Bass-Rankin took at similar approach in 1970 with Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, and while that animated holiday show is pretty good and worth watching each Christmas season, this one is better.

I will assume you have seen this before so my review will be limited to the video and audio quality of the transfer.Rudolph shows up on Blu Ray in a flimsy eco case (el cheapo, mostly air) with festive artwork. The disc itself is nicely silk screened in full color and mine came with a very pleasing slipcover over the main case. Despite the 25GB disc, the feature is presented in 1080p with a nice healthy bit rate, much higher than many big name movie releases sport. Since it is less than one hour long a BD 50 disc was not needed.This is one Blu Ray I was really looking forward to seeing and was hoping I would not be let down. I WASN'T !! Contrary to some other reviews I have read I am here to tell you that this Blu Ray transfer of Rudolph is simply beautiful. It is a MAJOR upgrade from the best quality DVD version you can find. The colors are gorgeous, vibrant and strong. Print damage is VERY minimal with my biggest complaint being a few stray hairs that show up for a few seconds perhaps 2 or 3 times during the almost one hour presentation.Remember that this was a Stop Motion Animation feature. This being the case you will notice the brightness flicker from time to time. This is NOT a defect in the transfer, it is an expected artifact from the process originally used to create this Christmas masterpiece. The same goes for minor color fluctuations. All the artifacts that occurred due to the now primitive stop motion animation process are amplified on this release but don't let that scare you off. It REALLY looks good folks. After seeing this year after year for 47 years , first in Black and White on our old Magnavox, later in color on our old Zenith, and lately upscaled to 1080p from my current DVD copy, I was THRILLED to see Rudolph looking this good. WOW!Rudolph is presented with chapter breaks (w/thumbnails) and a set-up screen that lets you switch between a few other languages. This is a bare bones release with NO extras at all. The English audio is presented in Dolby 5.1 TruHD. Don't expect an Avatar type mix here! Rudolph was originally mixed in mono and except for a few special audio effects (snow, wind, etc) most of the sound will emanate from your center channel. For this title I recommend switching your surround amp to Stereo and using the two front speakers for best results. Either way you wish to do it, the track is lossless, clear and as good as you will ever hear it. Dialogue is clear, songs all sound fine and it IS a noticeable bump in quality compared to my DVD version.If you are like me and have loved this film over the years then this Blu Ray release of Rudolph will not disappoint.

Written by Robert L. May and directed by Kizo Nagashima and Larry Roemer, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is just as engaging and entertaining for children today as it was when it was first released in 1964. The story is about a young reindeer named Rudolph (voice by Billie Mae Richards) who is teased and jaunted by other reindeer because he has a glowing red nose instead of a little black nose like every other reindeer. Seeing himself as a misfit, he decides to run away and is joined by an elf named Hermey (voice by Paul Soles). Hermey also considers himself a misfit because he wants to be dentist instead of a toy-maker like the other elves. They meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (voice by Larry D. Mann), unwanted toys on the Island of Misfit Toys, it's lion king named King Moonracer (voice by Stan Francis) and the scary abominable snowman. Other characters include the young reindeer Clarice (voice by Janet Orenstein), her father (voice by Paul Kligman), Comet the coach (voice by Paul Kligman), Santa Claus (voice by Stan Francis), the Head Elf (voice by Alfie Scopp), Charlie-in-the-Box (voice by Carl Banas) and a spotted elephant (voice by Carl Banas). The story is also narrated by Sam the Snowman, whose voice was done by Burl Ives (1909-1995).Songs in this adorable children's fantasy include:* A Holly Jolly Christmas (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)* Jingle Jingle Jingle (5 stars, performed by Santa Claus).* We Are Santa's Elves (5 stars, performed by Santa's elves.)* There's Always Tomorrow (5+ stars, performed by Clarice.)* We're A Couple of Misfits (5 stars, performed by Rudolph and Hermey.)* Fame and Fortune (4.5 stars, performed by Rudolf and Hermey.)* Silver and Gold (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)* The Most Wonderful Day of the Year (4.5 stars, performed by the misfit toys.)* Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (5+ stars, performed by Sam the Snowman: Burl Ives.)Overall, I rate Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with 5 out of 5 stars.

Rudolph's journey is just fantastic. What the producers have also done with this show is expanded on the misfit theme and added other characters not in the song to obtain a reasonable length show. There's a misfit elf and a wonderful collection of misfit toys on the Island of Misfit toys. I especially like the train with square wheels on its caboose. The idea for the misfit toys was bloody brilliant! And then there's the music. All the music throughout this show is wonderful. But I especially love Holly Jolly Christmas and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer Not many people know that Holly Jolly Christmas was originally written for the purpose of being included in this show and it's still one of the best Christmas songs there is. And Burl Ives's performance of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is far superior to the Gene Autry version of the song. Everything about Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is wonderful and classic. I watch this show 2-3 times every December,including every Christmas Eve night. And last November I purchased the mp3 Versions of Burl Ives Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and 3 mp3 versions of Holly Jolly Christmas,including Burl Ives.

Barred from attending reindeer school because of this difference, he ultimately discovers an island where 'misfit toys' with various deformities (a choo-choo with square wheels..etc) have been involuntarily isolated.Technically they are among their own kind so they should be happy, but they are instead gloomy. Unable to fulfil the role of what a toy SHOULD be doing, they instead feel lonely and punnished--wanting to escape the island and travel with Santa. They know that if they were like 'normal' toys, children would play with them.Joined by an elf-dentist named Hermey and a prospector named Yukon Cornelius (who does not add much to the story), Rudolph himself saves the day. And he maintains the love of a doe named Clarice who had always loved him for who he was, even when his own family was publically ashamed of his difference.Finally, it's important to note that Fireball and the other reindeer who teased him as 'children' could not even make Santa's prestigious team.

111,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,307514161,Simon Davis,"[2, 2]","A true treasure, is really the only way to describe this legendary Christmas television special that originally premiered in 1964. Arthur Rankin's totally captivating stop motion animation was a bench mark for everything that has come since and even with all of our modern computer technology nothing could come close to the beauty of the creations here. The story of that most famous of reindeers, the one and only Rudolph who's initial drawback of having a shiny nose eventually becomes his chief asset, is beautifully told in a music filled special narrated by Burl Ives in a perfect piece of casting as Sam the snowman. This special has quite rightly become a Christmas instituation every year since its initial release and appeals equally to both children and adults with its timeless message of tolerance and acceptance of all who are different. It has happily now been given a deserving release onto DVD back in its original form complete with deleted songs and a superb restoration.Based on the immortal Christmas song by Johnny Marks who was also responsible for all the lyrics in this television production, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, tells us the entire story of this most famous reindeer and how he became Santa's best helper. Born with a strange glowing nose that invites the ridicule of all who know him, Rudolph sees his whole position in life ruined when he is passed over to become part of Santa's team of reindeers. Despite having the affection of young Doe Clarice, Rudolph sets out to find a proper life for himself and along the way not only meets some colourful characters but also encounters some real danger. Rudolph teams up first with Hermey, an elf who like Rudolph is considered an outcast in his community as he doesn't enjoy making toys and wants instead to become a dentist. The pair soon join up with eccentric prospector Yukon Cornelius on his travels which involve escaping the clutches of the Abominable Snow Monster and visiting the strange island of misfit toys who are waiting for Santa to find homes for all of the unwanted toys gathered on the island. Rudolph however returns to the North Pole just prior to Christmas to find Santa in an absolute state about not being able to do the present deliveries on Christmas Eve as a terrible blizzard has blown up making conditions impossible to travel in all over the world. For once Rudolph's shiny nose is viewed as an asset and Santa finally sees that only with Rudolph's help guiding his sleigh will his deliveries be able to be made. Rudolph thus wins total acceptance with Hermey also finally getting a chance to do what he really wants in dentistry with even the Abominable Snow Monster finding himself a useful role in being tall enough to place the Christmas Star on Santa's Christmas tree at the happy conclusion.Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, has been the inspiration for countless animators since 1964 with Tim Burton in his latest effort The Corpse Bride, being the latest to pay homage to the genius of Arthur Rankin's work. I personally feel Rudolph, is the crowning glory of the many fine animated specials produced by Rankin and his team. The characters in the story all have their own distinct personalities from the timid Rudolph, to the colourful Yukon Cornelius, through to the harried Santa and Mrs. Claus. Despite the limitations of this early animation it is a supreme achievement that these characters are able to convey identifiable qualities to the viewing audience. Particulary endearing are of course Rudolph's character who only yearns for the acceptance of his peers which I'm sure we can all identify with, and Hermy who is also in the same situation. It was a wonderful idea to have the character of Sam the Snowman (who seems to have been the inspiration for the later Frosty the Snowman), present to narrate the story and they could not have found a more perfect performer than singer/actor Burl Ives to take on the voice of this jolly character. Ives at the film's conclusion gets the opportunity to sing the immortal title song which I feel is synonymous with the Christmas season and for which he as a performer would be forever after associated with. As befitting a family Christmas special Rudolph, contains some other charming musical numbers as well such as Holly Jolly Christmas, and Silver and Gold, that are sure to delight old and young viewers alike.Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is such a Christmas fixture that I couldn't imagine the festive season without a screening of this television classic. I find the special so enchanting not only because of its breathtaking animation and lovable characters but also by the charming innocence of the whole story, something which is sadly missing in much of our present day television programming. Outstanding Christmas specials that still entertain forty one years after they first appeared are few and far between and if you haven't had the joy of seeing the story of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer in Arthur Rankin's television masterpiece then do yourself and your family a favour and treat them to a screening of it next Christmas.",5,Immortal Christmas Classic Featuring The Most Famous Reindeer Of All,1136332800,"01 4, 2006",0.4287

Hermy is a great elf, and Yukon Cornelious is hilarious, when he looks for silver and gold. Rudolph is an enjoyable outcasted character. Bumble the snow monster is also a silly monster, and I do like how he reforms in the end. I always thought that maybe Bumble might have been a misfit, himself.

This 1964 classic carries a special message of forgiveness and kindness, as a tormented Rudolph finds his place in the world after having run away from his peers. Seeing what their actions did to poor Rudolph, they come to accept him as an equal, and perhaps admire his gift of a shiny nose that saved Christmas. Burl Ives is the perfect narrator, who sings two signature Christmas songs, SILVER AND GOLD and HOLLY JOLLY CHRISTMAS. This special has all the right sights and sounds for its kind.

The unforgettable characters and memorable music make &quot;Rudolph&quot; one of the videos my family never fails to watch each winter.

For the longest time I watched &quot;Rudolph&quot; every Christmas and &quot;Peter Cottontail&quot; every Easter, but didn't know the wealth of other wonderfully great shows awaiting me.

Sam the Snowman does (voiced by the unforgettable Burl Ives) and he tells us the unknown story behind the legendary &quot;Rudolph Song&quot;: When the other reindeer won't let him play in all the reindeer games, rejected, red-nosed Rudolph goes on a quest to find himself. He meets up with another misfit, Herbie the Elf, who leaves Santa's reknown toymaking elves to pursue his life-long career in dentistry (&quot;You wanna be a what? &quot;). Together with the help of the affible gold miner, Yukon Cornelius (who's on his own quest to track down the Bumble - that's the Abominable Snow Monster to you and me) they find the island home of the Misfit Toys who just want to be loved (hey, before there was &quot;Toy Story,&quot; there was the Island of Misfit Toys. ) Rudolph and friends return to the North Pole in time to find a frantic Santa ready to cancel Christmas on account of a blustery storm. But Rudolph's &quot;shiny nose, so bright&quot; helps Santa guide his sleigh through the fog...and rest, as Sam the Snowman says, goes down in his-tor-y.Christmas just ain't Christmas without watching RUDOLPH, THE RED-NOSED REINDEER. This is my favorate Holiday cartoon (closely tied with Santa Clause is Coming To Town). This stop-motion animation classic paved the way for more recent animators like Tim Burton to flesh out the medium, so to speak. But nothing touches the heart and soul of Christmas like this story does. I'll admit it, I still wait for it to come on every year just so I can sing along and hear some of my favorate lines again: &quot;I'm cuuuute. She said I'm cuuuute!&quot; , &quot;Bumbles bounce!&quot; and &quot;Eat. No one likes a skinny Santa&quot; to name just a few. Am I glad it's out on DVD? Yes!

Well, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer does exactly that by using the misfits theme to appeal to such a wide audience.For a basic plot summary, Rudolph sees the young reindeer with the glowing red nosed mocked for his differences and unable to join in any reindeer games. Without any chance of joining Santa's sleigh team, Rudolph (along with fellow misfit Elf Herbie, who wants to be a dentist instead of making toys) embarks out into the wilderness himself, encountering an Abominable Snow Monster and a hearty prospector who helps him survive. Along the way, Rudolph and Herbie find themselves on the Island of Misfit Toys, an experience that encourages both of them to return home.Because every child (whether perceived or otherwise) goes through that ugly duckling stage in life, the themes in this little special are indeed timeless. The children who watched it originally back in 1964 and the following years grew up, but never quite outgrew its classic holiday themes, passing it on to their own children until it now has become a holiday tradition.What also helps Rudolph stand apart from the rest of the holiday specials is its Claymation format. There is probably a reason why Claymation is no longer used today in Hollywood on this sort of scale, but that rarity only enhances this show's appeal.Overall, there are three holiday media events that I try not to miss each December: It's A Wonderful Life, Frosty the Snowman, and this Rudolph. I can watch them with a sibling/child and introduce a new generation to the old traditions, or I can watch them by myself and rekindle those Christmases long, long ago.",5,Absolutely Timeless,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",0.4504

Now, with this DVD, I can put away my &quot;taped from television&quot; copy and enjoy the complete, fully-restored splendor of Rudolph.For the first time since 1964, the complete, unedited version can be seen on this DVD. Throughout the years, the special has been trimmed to allow for more commercial time, including the removal of a longer version of &quot;We Are Santa's Elves&quot;, a duet reprise of &quot;We're A Couple Of Misfits.&quot; The edits where made as long ago as 1965, so getting the complete version is a real treat. It even restores Rudolph's Elf friend's proper name, &quot;Hermey&quot; as opposed to the edited &quot;Herbie.&quot;Burl Ives has perhaps his most classic role as Sam the Snowman, singing many now-classic songs that were written for this program, such as &quot;Holly-jolly Christmas&quot; and &quot;Silver and Gold.&quot; (Of course, he also sings Johnny Marks wonderful &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer!&quot;)The Animagic puppets are never more welcome than at Christmas.
