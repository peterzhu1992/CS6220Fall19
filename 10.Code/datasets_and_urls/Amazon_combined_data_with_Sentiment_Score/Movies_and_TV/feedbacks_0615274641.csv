And I am so thankful that Hollywood has produced numerous factual documentaries and fact based films exposing the horror of the Nazis and the Holocaust. It strikes me as strange that there is no similar size body of work by Hollywood exposing the 20 million murdered by Soviet Communist leader Josef Stalin or the 40 million murdered by Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong or the other atrocities of Communism. While precise figures may never be known, it is estimated that as many as 259 million people were murdered under Communist regimes between 1917-1987.With a growing number people from labour leaders to politicians to those who consider themselves the intellectual elite openly endorsing socialism and communism as a model for America, this film together with Faith of the Century: A History of Communism and Socialism A Clear and Present Danger are films every American should watch. The promised utopia has never been realised by any socialist/communist country and communism has been responsible for more death and suffering in the last 100 years than any other single system of belief. Even today, political prisons operate in countries like China, North Korea, Vietnam and elsewhere.

I am only too aware of how many Lithuanian people were deported to frozen outlying areas of the Soviet Union in an effort to recolonize their country with Russians from other parts of the former U.S.S.R. Two of my mother's cousins, in fact, froze to death in Siberia dying of exhaustion, starvation and overexposure. It has been a source of pain for me and my family for decades. What is MORE painful, however, is to realize that the West, as depicted in this film and as it truly is, has done NOTHING to call to account the atrocities done to millions of innocent people in Eastern Europe before, during and after the Second World War. While there is an overabundance of literature, movies, books, etc. on Nazi crimes very little exists about what the Soviets did in their murder of 20 million people. This film was very unique in that you could choose to have subtitles in any number of languages. I chose Lithuanian because this is the language I grew up speaking. I also agree with the creators of the film and the author ofFROM IMMIGRANT TO U.S. MARINE:Kaunas-Dresden-Quantico-Da Nang-Tam Ky-Potsdam-Santo Domingo, LTC Dominik Margele, USMC, Ret who quite clearly asked the question: WHERE ARE THE NUREMBERG TRIALS OF THE COMMUNIST WAR CRIMINALS? They murdered many more people than the Nazis EVER did. The footage in this film is powerful and dramatic.

7,A65AF4E1N6GUO,615274641,Damon Enola,"[11, 20]","This documentary does demonstrate the many evil deeds enacted by Stalin (and could've added more) and I'm glad there is a documentary that demonstrates some level of parity between the more obvious evil Adolf Hitler and the less obvious evil Josef Stalin. It also does a great job at exposing the way-too-comfortable relationship between the Nazis and the Soviets during 1939-41. And it definitely demonstrated that there was anti-Semitism in both the Nazi and Soviet camps.All that being stated, I have 3 problems with this documentary.1) In terms of just providing balance, it would've been worth noting the heroism of the Red Army between 1941-45 in stopping Nazi aggression and providing a solid Eastern Front (at the cost of over 14 million soldiers) that helped the Allies as a whole defeat Nazi Germany. Even the most right-wing person could recognize that the Allies' task of defeating Hitler would've been much harder, if not impossible, without the tremendous help from the Soviets. Yes, the Red Army committed atrocities too (as did the other Allies to a much smaller extent) but it was part of the necessary war to defeat Hitler.2) The idea of the Nazis being just junior Communists is just ludicrous. Yes, both believed in totalitarian systems. Yes both believed in murder and repression in order to maintain rule. However, the Nazis were Socialist in name only (and that was to acquire votes in German elections prior to 1933). Hitler despised Bolshevism (and what he called Judeo Bolshevism). Hitler's idol was Frederick the Great (hint, not a Socialist) and Hitler wanted a return to a Prussian empire. He considered as friends Mussolini and Franco and backed Franco and his Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. The Soviets supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War. If the Nazis and Soviets were so chummy, then how come Hitler decided to launch Operation Barbarossa in the first place (the documentary completely neglects this)? Why did Stalin respond with such ferocity (the documentary completely neglects this too)?3) Marx/Engles may have called for mass executions and Lenin did order executions be carried, but neither one is on the scale or ideology of Stalin. Stalin was his own creature and not a blind follower of Marxist-Leninist ideology. In fact, while Stalin claimed to support the beliefs of the Marxist-Leninists, he had no problem ordering the executions of many of them including Trotsky, who denounced him, and Kirov, who supported him but was too much of a threat. Stalin has more in common with Ivan the Terrible than he does with Lenin. It's quite telling that all the original Party members ended up dead under Stalin's rule (with Trotsky, I believe, being the last holdout). The documentary paints the picture that it was the teachings of Marx-Engles and Lenin that drove Stalin to cause the deaths of over 20 million Russians which denies Stalin's own psychological makeup as the true cause of this scale of death. It's quite telling that when Khrushchev took power after Stalin's death, he set out to de-Stalinize the Soviet Union but kept Marx and Lenin in, implying just how rogue Stalin was.This documentary would've been more credible if it just focused on Stalin, his atrocities, and the troubling thought that there are people in Russia (including its leaders) today who are willing to ignore these atrocities altogether and focus on how great Stalin was. Blood on the Snow is a much better documentary for this. Linking all these deaths to the Communist Manifesto is just intellectually dishonest.",4,Why 4 stars?,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",-0.2384
8,A2JCDEK5UVKU1Q,615274641,D. Demro Vietnam War and WWII historian,"[0, 0]","As someone who has extensively studied WWII history, I was well aware of the millions of murders committed by the Soviet Union against its own citizens. But until one watches a documentary such as this does the horror and gravity of Soviet evil hit home. I think few people are aware of the fact that it was Russia who initiated gassing of the unwanted by running the exhaust pipes of trucks back into the truck so all aboard would be dead by the time of its arrival. Likewise, it was Russia that initiated the extermination of certain races and it was Germany who merely perfected it. It was Karl Marx who professed we must rid ourselves of those who don't produce, and it was the Soviets who put this into practice long before Germany. Thank you Edvins Snore for shining a light on one of the best-kept secrets. I only wish I had seen this documentary prior to 2008 when I travelled to Ukraine to teach a semester at the University of Science and Arts in Kiev. I would have liked to question the Ukranians about the massive starvation of 1932-33 when Stalin ordered the removal of all food from Ukraine, resulting in the starvation of SEVEN MILLION people in one year! Russian history is something few people in Ukraine cared to discuss due to the level of suffering that was enduring by so many. There are still many wounds left open in people whose parents or grandparents were victims of Stalin and Lenin. My personal library has many documentaries on Nazi atrocities, but this DVD adds to a very small collection of those related to Soviet atrocities. Due to the allied ties to Russia, much of the horror documented in this DVD sadly went unpunished or even reported. In contrast, those who were responsible for these atrocities were ultimately decorated for their actions. This is something that should be shown in all colleges and universities along with all the other critical history that is tragically ignored.I also recommend watching the DVD Katyn which tells the story of how Russia murdered over TWENTY-TWO THOUSAND polish soldiers and educated at the beginning of WWII, then tried to frame the Nazis for this atrocity.

I would also recommend to reviewRussia's War: Blood Upon the Snowalthough it does give a white-wash at the introduction pretending Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky were innocents, when in fact they laid the foundations for communist atrocity (Marx, Engels) or implemented the betrayal of the Russian Revolution's democratic aspirations, as well as initiating the first stages of the massive genocides to follow (Lenin and Trotsky). Also seeWorld War II: Behind Closed Doorsfor coverage details on the Hitler-Stalin pact not found so much in Soviet Story nor in Blood Upon the Snow.But I should point out there is a confusion on the citations given for one of the most damning quotations presented in the documentary, where the terms Revolutionary Holocaust are presented, along with the term racial trash. Because of the citation errors, people go looking for the original and don't find it so easy. This is reflected in the two negative reviews, and should be corrected by the producers. The original quote appears to be from Friedrich Engels, The Magyar Struggle, Neue Rheinische Zeitung, January 13, 1849. This paper appeared, according to citations, in the book Karl Marx, The Revolutions of 1848, Political Writings Vol. 1, London, Penguin Books, 1973. So it sometimes gets attributed to Marx. Here's the quote:Among all the nations and sub-nations of Austria, only three standard-bearers of progress took an active part in history, and are still capable of life -- the Germans, the Poles and the Magyars. Hence they are now revolutionary. All the other large and small nationalities and peoples are destined to perish before long in the revolutionary world storm [revolutionary holocaust] For that reason they are now counter-revolutionary. ... these residual fragments of peoples always become fanatical standard-bearers of counter-revolution and remain so until their complete extirpation or loss of their national character... [A general war will] wipe out all these racial trash [V&ouml;lkerabf&auml;lle - original was given at Marxist websites as petty hidebound nations] down to their very names. The next world war will result in the disappearance from the face of the earth not only of reactionary classes and dynasties, but also of entire reactionary peoples. And that, too, is a step forward.See the full article text at [..] website, but with the toned-down language. The term world storm is a literal translation, but in the context, the term holocaust is a reasonable translation also. Note how the [..] website -- run by dedicated communists -- deliberately softened the really ugly word V&ouml;lkerabf&auml;lle (racial trash) into revolutionary hidebound nations, whatever that means. Something like running dogs I suppose, whatever that means.But it is not as if Marx is let off the hook. Both of them have numerous quotes advocating genocide, wiping out whole ethnic populations, exposing terrible racism against blacks, serbs, Poles, and with intensive Jew-hatred.

18,A4ECYB20UWH3N,615274641,R. Bono Riccardo,"[75, 88]","Occasionally there are films of such import to historical understanding that they stand out head over heels over all else...This is one such film. It supports the thesis that, not only was Nazism the heir to Communism, but that its leaders, Hitler, and Lenin, and Stalin, substantially cooperated with one another and learned from one another. Nazism was only different from Communism is that it was ethnically and racially based...whereas Communism was economically and class based. Philosophically, as Goebbels publicly wrote, they were the same, in their employment of repression, and mass murder, and fear to achieve their idealistic aims.The romantic leanings of too many in the West, then as now, always seem to pit early Communism against Nazism....one being good and idealistic, and the other being pure evil. This DVD demonstrates like no other film, that nothing could be further from the truth...for Nazism and Communism, aside from occasional distrust, from the beginning, were bound together with bonds of friendship, affection, and cooperation. That alliance ceased when Hitler broke his written pact with Stalin in their common plans for dividing a post war Europe....as had ALREADY been achieved with their joint invasion of Poland. It's often portrayed that it was Hitler who began WW II. True, as far as it goes...But the full truth is that, in fact, it was both Hitler and Stalin who planned and executed the 1939 attack on Poland.In addition, this DVD is an excellent antidote in smashing the illusions of all too many North American liberals, and Euro and South American leftists...who still believe that somehow...it was only Stalin who abandoned the ideals of Communism....to become one of the two bloodiest murders of the 20th century. These illusions still exist today, in the all too gentle reminder, that Lenin was somehow the good communist. In fact, this DVD documents Lenin's class warfare and mass murder of ten million, as the ideological solution paving the way for his ideal communist state...and the New Soviet Man. This Hitler directly copied with the New German Man. Nazism also emulated the concentration camps, which were FIRST established in Lenin's regime....BEFORE Stalin....and served as the Nazi template for the Holocaust....20 years before it occurred.The Soviet Story is a powerful documentary...for it speaks the truth with first person interviews, and weaves a quite convincing review of the Soviet era historic documentation...key parts of which, were smuggled out of today's new Russian state apparatus. In fact, it's well to remember Putin's absurd statements about the fall of the USSR being one of the great tragedies of the twentieth century. This is why this DVD remains timely...as the new Russia still retains significant elements of the old USSR. It remains timely, because the same coterie of delusional western intellectuals still remain fuzzy about the harsh reality of Russian history. As the reviewer for The Economist wrote, this film is a powerful antidote to the sanitization of the past.For Americans, history will show a period of hesitation about the post war intentions of Stalin. But by 1948, those intentions were abundantly clear to all but the most willful deniers. The key roles of George Kennan, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower defined our initial responses to the USSR. Containment in it's peaceful impulse, and in its defensive impulse, in NATO and MAD, BOTH played their role in the evolution of the leadership of the USSR. The world did avoid a nuclear holocaust. And, as an addendum on the ending of the Cold War, it's well to note that it was the big tent Republican, Ronald Reagan, who opposed his own right wing, to negotiate with Micheal Gorbachev. Both, along with Lech Walesa and the Pope, with the big exception of the old Yugoslavia, paved the way to the relatively bloodless denouement to the Cold War.I can therefore also highly recommend:The Rebellion of Ronald Reagan: A History of the End of the Cold War, by Jim Mann.",5,The Harsh Reality,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",-0.0308
