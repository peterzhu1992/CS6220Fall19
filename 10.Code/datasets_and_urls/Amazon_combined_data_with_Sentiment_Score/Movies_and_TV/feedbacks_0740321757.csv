2,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,740321757,Harold Wolf Doc,"[14, 14]","Great story, low budget. Don't expect perfection in acting when multi-million dollar acting leads are not possible. Get over that and you find a great story, with remarkable work done well enough to encourage a purchase. 'HOMELESS for the HOLIDAYS',written-directed-produced by George A. Johnson, was reported in the news to have received a TV syndication deal. Perhaps even greater things ahead for this do-all Johnson and his wife Karen, who seemed, according to the credits, to have even more jobs than George.The story is very timely. An up-and-coming marketing expert, Jack Baker, is forced to take the blame (unfairly) for an error in product labeling which sent a couple hundred uses to the hospital. The error: Do NOW inhale fumes placed on a cleaning product. That's a bit unbelievable, but the rest of the story is very convincing. It was based on a true story. Of course, with no income, the affluent family struggles, and is destined to be homeless by Christmas Day. The Wooded Falls community (actual filming taking place in several towns of northeast Indiana) has unemployment at 7% (low for 2010 reality). In the end this family of 4 learns what is truly important about Christmas and even more about caring for others, giving, and peace. A very good ending. It earned a 5 DOVE rating.Matt Moore (actor turned Indiana pastor) plays Jack. Matt is an Adam Sandler look-alike sound-alike person who does a great job. Wife Sheryl (Crystal DeWitt-Hinkle) is more convincing in her lovable scenes than her troubled moments but still gets the job done. Siblings Adam (Cole Brandenberger) & Michelle (Gabrielle Phillips) seem to know their way around the film, even looking good in the auditions bonus feature. David Sisco played Wesley & Brad Stine a grocery manager; both doing so well you found them totally annoying, as you were supposed to. In general, the acting seemed a bit forced, but yet not so bad as to destroy the great story, so typical of what is happening in the 2009-10 economic times.Feature 105 minutesBonus material includes deleted scenes, a VERY interesting production diary, audition highlights, commentary option on the feature, discussion guide, and subtitles (but subtitles ran about one dialogue line behind the audio).Bottom line, not your blockbuster, but worthy of 4 stars and I'm glad I bought it.After viewing, you may find yourself more generous to the needy.",4,A GOOD CHRISTMAS STORY DONE OFF-HOLLYWOOD,1290902400,"11 28, 2010",0.2551

A big fancy house and a high paying job might seem important, but nothing is more important than family. This is the lesson that you learn in Homeless for the Holidays.George Johnson is a big executive who loses his job right before Christmas. The only employment he can find is an embarrassing job where he has to dress like a penguin. But that isn't enough to cover his high mortgage. He finds himself in danger of losing his home. But in the mist of this financial crisis he learns what's really important. He builds a better relationship with his wife and children, and they find that even if they are homeless for the holidays, the most important thing is that they are together.Homeless for the Holidays is a wonderful family film. Its based on a true story and one that many people are going to relate to in these tough ecominc times. The performances of Matt Moore and Crystal Dewitt-Hinkle are flawless. This is a movie that will make you laugh and cry, and in the end, appreciate all the gifts you have. Its a great choice to add to your holiday film collection and something the whole family will enjoy.**Complimentary copy received in exchange for an honest review**",3,Cute Holiday Film,1370649600,"06 8, 2013",0.1669
5,AAV3HU72C3R3G,740321757,Picturesque Music,"[0, 0]","Okay, let's get started: a lot of reviews for this movie are quite silly/not credible. This isn't a 5/5 movie, no matter what anybody tells you.The simple truth of the matter is that, overall, this movie had some of the worst acting of any movie I've ever seen. The camera work was also poor (faces regularly filled the entire screen, for example--and I do mean the entire thing). A couple of scenes were absolutely ludicrous. One such scene is 3-4 minutes long and consists of a very weird store manager just being overbearing. It added nothing to the story and was very strange.This said, I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1 because I managed to finish it, despite it being quite long. The story itself was really not bad, and the writing wasn't even that bad. I must be honest in saying around Christmastime I have a very high tolerance for cheesy movies, though. This kind of thing I wouldn't tolerate outside of December, but I regularly don't finish movies if I don't find any value to them and for some reason I kept going with this one.",3,Here is a genuine review (not one from a cheer-leading shill),1386720000,"12 11, 2013",0.0052

I don't feel comfortable with the joke in the NLCV, but the story in this Homeless Holidays is so good and hit close to home. It is good to see a family pull together and re-evaluate what is important to them during tough time. Where do you find a good guy like the main character here? I like the support actors as well. The kids are great. Glad I had a chance to see it.",5,A good clean family movie,1332115200,"03 19, 2012",0.576

This film is about a young family enjoying the American Dream until it goes bust; however instead of finger pointing at political figures, or scrambling for help from government or extended family, this family discovers there is sound reason a certain historical figure from Nazareth is called Saviour, Mighty Counselor and the Prince of Peace - peace for the soul. This film poses the question, As America descends into the abyss, what can you place your trust in - promises of politicians, the life savings and benevolence of friends and family, or the living Lord?",5,Timely Message,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",0.8052
