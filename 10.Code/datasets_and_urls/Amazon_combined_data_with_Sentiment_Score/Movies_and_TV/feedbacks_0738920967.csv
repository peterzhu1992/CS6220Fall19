This is your Gloria Estefan-type music. Kathy Smith has done it again, reinventing standard exercise programs. Here, the Latin rhythm workout takes place in the Los Angeles Conga Room dance floor and with the backdrop of a complete live latin band.... now that's different! She encourages one to wear smooth sole shoes and to do the exercise minus carpet. Smooth shoes enhance those dancing pivots you will make; again, you need smooth surface you you must pivot.You will be dancing here, yes, So hone up on the cha cha and get ready to dance the salsa, merengue and the cha-cha.Surprisingly, Smith does very little instruction BEFORE the workout starts. She will briefly demonstrate, but I believe it is helpful to show us different angles of the leg positions, and we don't get that here. There aren't any demonstrations on these steps offering side views for us to follow. Even when the dance changes frequently, there isn't time to learn, you just go into these steps. If anything, dance steps will take time to learn.At the end is an instructional bonus on partner dancing; two dancers teach the steps to each dance with a partner. But as I say, it is at the end of the tape. Oh well, you may just learn to do these for the local dance clubs.Workouts I and II. The workouts are 20 minutes each, and if you work straight through, you will be doing the 40 minute heart pumping full power workout.The Band - The live band is mild, not penetrating, energetic and easy on the ears. They don't take from the workout at all, as they are strategically placed without close-ups.This workout is fun, different, challenging. When you are able to follow the instructors, you are doing great, it will be an accomplishment. I encourage this videotape. As always, Kathy Smith videotape workouts have all been top quality. She hasn't let me down yet. .....MzRizz...",5,A departure from the usual! Musically energizing!,1017446400,"03 30, 2002",0.2756

However, there are sections in the middle and in the second half that didn't flow well. It seemed that she was not in synch with the music at times, which was distracting. The music isn't that great either. Also, if you've ever tried the awesome Latin Xplosion with Carlos then you know, this just doesn't even come close.In the bonus partner dance section (without Kathy), one of the male and female exercisers demonstrate how to dance Salsa, Merengue and ChaCha.

I am a good dancer so I found the steps very easy to learn. You just have to let yourself go and get into the enthusiasm of the dancing. I find it to be an intermediate kind of aerobic workout. beginners can just do the first 20 minutes. I do work up a sweat. Do it in work out clothes you feel kind of sexy in, not lumpy sweat pants. It seems to help me get into the spirit of the video which is definately sexy! I gave it 3 stars because Kathy Smith herself looks a little awkward to me doing this video. She is not wearing the right outfit for it either. She looks like she is going on shopping errands in her modest sweater set. The dancers around her look much more natural and sensual as they dance. But, that's just my opinion. Her moves are stiff compared to the other dancers, so I prefer to follow the other dancers. They are more fun to watch. Other than that, it is fun to do as a break from my other videos.",3,Shake those hips!,1051574400,"04 29, 2003",0.3105
3,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,738920967,Beth Cholette doctor_beth,"[15, 16]","Kathy Smith's Latin Rhythm Workout is a fun, cardiovascular fitness routine which combines latin dance moves with a few more traditional exercises. Kathy works out with two dance instructors, Clara and Ashley, in front of a class of about 10 additional participants. The setting is on a dance floor in front of a band on a stage, although the camera occasionally shows the group in a smaller, carpeted room. Prior to the start of the workout, Kathy provides a brief overview of the three main moves that will be used: the salsa, the merengue, and the cha-cha.The video is actually broken into two separate workouts, although they flow together nicely for a longer session. Workout 1 starts with a 5-minute warm-up consisting of simple steps to get you moving; you'll really shake your hips and begin to raise your heart rate from the start. Next, you'll focus on each of the three dance moves in turn, spending approximately 5 minutes on each segment. Because you are just learning the footwork, Kathy does not specifically teach any upper body moves, but I found that by involving my shoulders and hips in the movements, my heart rate was really getting up by the end of this workout, which lasted about 19 1/2 minutes total. Workout 2 starts right up with a slow merengue segment that serves as a kind of warm-up. Following this, the workout again focuses on each of the three dance moves in turn, starting with a fast merengue, moving to the salsa, and ending with the cha-cha. This time, you'll add some more traditional exercises to the dance steps--eg, there are lunges, knee lifts, etc. You'll also do slightly more complicated versions of the basic steps as well as add a bit more upper body into the movements. The second workout is about 18 minutes long, and then Kathy leads you through a short series of stretches to cool-down, bringing the entire workout in at about 41 minutes. As a bonus, the the video ends with a brief segment where Clara and Ashley display how to perform each of the three dance moves with a partner (this was the only part of the video that was true dance instruction).After doing both workouts in one longer session, I wasn't quite sweating, but I definitely felt like I got a good, low-impact cardio workout. I'm not a fan of complex choreography, but I found the dance moves to be simple to learn and fun to perform. At times, I'm sure I was moving in ways that didn't quite match what Kathy and the others were doing, but the great thing was that it didn't matter since I was moving, keeping my heart rate up, and having a good time. I thought that Kathy cued well as always and that she did a nice job with the dance moves--she certain danced better than I did! She provided mostly live instruction, but there were also occasional voiceovers in which she gave additional cueing and form pointers. Overall, I found this to be a fun cardio workout which I know I will use frequently, especially when I don't feel like doing a more traditional aerobic workout.",5,Lots of fun and a good workout too!,1111449600,"03 22, 2005",0.2341

Kathy does introduce the dance steps quickly, and sometimes you might feel a bit lost. However, BE PATIENT. It will only take you a few viewings to get the moves, as they really aren't very complex at all. The pay-off is worth the effort. I'm 53 years old and have been doing step aerobics for over 20 years. During the past 4 years I've had some injuries that have prevented me from doing the high impact step DVDs, so I had turned to Leslie Sansone's walking videos. These are okay for days that I don't want to get too sweaty, but I wanted a REAL workout that would get my heart rate up in a FUN way. This Kathy Smith Latin workout is just the right thing for me.

To keep my review as to the point as possible, this looked like an amature video. First of all, they are wearing black pants in a dim studio so therefore it is really hard to see exactly what they are doing with there legs and feet. Secound, Kathy is all over the place with her movements and not in a benificial position for the viewer at times. There were times where she would introduce a new movement, and the camera wasn't even on her. She almost at times looked like she had forgotten that she was suposed to be teaching this routine. There are also moments where she had forgoten in the original taping to que a new movement, so you will here an overhead of her voice, which is just so amature and cheap.

Both my parents have been dancing salsa for years, the old traditional style, that is, not the new age salsa based on the Latin Hustle of the 80s.Kathy does a good job, and so do the two very professional people framing her. I must say that I've read some of the other reviews and I simply can't understand why somebody would say such insulting things about Kathy's dancing, and even about the others. I understand people are entitled to their opinion but to say things like robotic dancer, clueless, don't buy this DVD, a total waste, and worse things....

This is a 40 minute LOW IMPACT work-out that is broken into two 20 minute segments to be done together or on their own. What you will be doing is essentially dancing to infectious latin music and having 40 minutes of fun. If you are like me, good music makes working out easy. Have you ever run on the treadmill listening to the radio and suddenly started working out faster and better when your favorite song came on? Well, this work out is a great choice if you love latin music and you love dancing.I bought it in order to have a fun alternative cardio routine and I'm very happy with it. I cannot say this is the most intense cardio workout on the planet - but it does not have to be. Even for advanced exercisers, there are days when you just cant force yourself to perform to super-human limits and this is a great work-out for that day. For beginners, this is a FUN work-out and you will work up a pretty good sweat just following the moves. To get an idea of how intense the workout is, just imagine dancing non-stop in a club for 40 minutes.The steps are easy to follow for beginners - although if you find it hard to follow dance moves or hate dancing all together please don't bother picking this video up and then critisizing it. Similarly, if you are an advanced salsa dancer and impress the crowds with your dance moves at clubs, this work-out will be boring for you - unless of course you do your own thing to the music.This work-out is ideal for beginners who need something simple to get them started, for kids, for people of all fitness levels who just want to have fun dancing. This is NOT a workout for strength and muscle building - you should have a separate routine for that to alternate with this one for good overall fitness. You will learn the basic steps to the cha cha, the merengue and the samba and you do not need any equipment except for a moderate area to dance in.The setting is in a club with a live band and no-one is even wearing tradional work-out clothes. Kathy is fun and motivational as usual and having lots of fun! I did not think her cueing was bad and she did not struggle with the moves in my opinion. She was not trying to teach an advanced latin dance class - she was just leading an exercise class with simple dance moves for fun and she did that VERY well. A member of the cast was a more advanced dancer and often demonstrated more advanced moves to the dance. But overall, no-one should buy this tape in hopes of learning to become a professional dancer - take it for what is is - a simple cardio work-out with basic moves to latin rhythms and you should be very happy.",5,Fun for all fitness levels!,1025568000,"07 2, 2002",0.5245

I assumed that this DVD would actually be suitable for a beginner to get the simple steps and then move along with; that they;d start with an introduction and then start an easy routine and move up to something more complex but still suitable for a beginner.Their review on the steps were 3 small sections in the beginning that just slowed the video down (good luck basing your dance routine off of a slow down if you're brand new to it) and then jumped right into the routine. For someone like me, who doesn't have much self esteem and feels stupid dancing alone in her room with the blinds shut...this doesn't help you feel more comfortable. It makes you feel more klutzy.The warm up is easy enough though.And if you give yourself a few weeks to get the routines down, you'll probably be OK.It just wasn't for me though...",3,"If you have self esteem, this is for you.",1249603200,"08 7, 2009",0.4988

I just tried the Latin Rhythm Workout, and it was great...all I need now is a partner! I would say that I am an intermediate in aerobics, and believe it or not, I was having such a good time (as were my animals watching me!) the time flew by and the first section was finished before I knew it. My heart rate was mildly elevated, but as with most aerobics, once one knows the moves, or keeps it up, one can pump it up, so to speak. I went right into the second section, and could not finish because the dancing kept up-tempo, and as I really got into it, I felt that I had had it, so to speak. If you are looking for something a little different to add to your aerobic routines, try the Latin Dancing...the dancers are very good and seem to be having a good time; there are a few individuals standing along the upper side of the dance floor dancing along, and there is one dancer in the back who seems to be making silly faces every so often (which is noticed after working out several times!) I will give Kathy Smith an A for keeping her workouts fresh, plus she's actually pretty good! She also gives Clara Basset, the very excellent dancer who assisted in choreographing this video, some time, since I have noticed that in most of Kathy's videos, she does not like to give time to others if she can help it! In this case, it is quite appropriate to let the very lively Clara show off some of those latin moves! A live band (well, it says live, but I wondered how much was actually live music, and how much was canned) really adds to the atmosphere, and one can make the most of this workout. I also found it a bit odd in the beginning, I could not quite figure out what was strange, but the video cuts from the dance floor to a blue carpeted, enclosed room that has painted conga and bongo drums on it, and back to the dance floor in sinc with the moves, music, and commentary! Mainly, this workout is fun. One can learn the basics of some of the most popular latin dances and really get those hips and legs moving! It is perfect for beginners, and as one progresses, one can really get into the moves and dance to the whole tape. What is even better, if you are ever invited to go clubbin', you will NOT be left behind since you are learning some of the most popular and fun Latin dancing steps: The Merenge', the Cha Cha, and the Salsa. Very fun, effective, and truly an added spice to any workout for beginner's to intermediate. Just be ready to get those hips and legs movin'!",4,THIS IS FUN!!!,1088640000,"07 1, 2004",0.347

18,A2TTG7PPYZUV0N,738920967,Thalia del Fuego Bellydance performer/ instr...,"[2, 2]","I began using this DVD at the same time that I was taking Latin dance classes and struggling with the fine points of Latin rhythm and hip motion. As a belly dancer, I had no problem with the concept of hip motion, but my teacher frequently told me I had to tone it down a bit, and I was also finding the salsa rhythm particularly hard to follow. All of that changed as a consequence of using this DVD.Like any other aerobic dance workout, this one may be a bit challenging for beginners with no dance background. You will simply have to be patient, do a little bit at a time and backtrack on occasion. However, this workout will soon become effortless for you if you have any dance background at all.Kathy's transitions are smooth, and her choice of steps is very appropriate for a lightweight, fun workout. By the fourth or fifth run-through with this workout, I found that the time was just flying by and I was doing the movements more and more automatically. One day, I finished the workout and realized that I hadn't thought at all about doing the steps correctly. They had simply happened naturally as I followed Kathy's lead and listened to the music. It dawned on me that I understood the salsa rhythm perfectly well on an intuitive level, and that Latin dance would come natrually to me if I just relaxed and stopped obsessing about every step.Another reason that I enjoy this DVD is that it is SOLID Latin dance. Personally, I don't go along with the current trend toward mix it up workouts with 15 minutes of Latin, 15 of Hip HOp, etc. When I'm in the mood to do Latin, I find it very frustrating to have to switch to jazz or Hip Hop right at the point where I'm just getting in the groove.It's like shifting gears to go up a hill when you are having a nice smooth bike ride.

The camera was only on her when it had to be when she spoke since she can't dance (Sorry, but it's true). The two acompanying teachers are sweet & enthusiastic, but they also seemed very stiff/robotic considering even though they are professionals. I kept focusing on a blond in the back (at least I can kinda see her between Kathy's & the other teacher's heads) who had more style, skill, technique, fluidity & enjoyment for dancing then all of them put together.At the end there was a bonus dancing with partner and the woman professional was still giving instructions & berating the male teacher about how to move & when he didn't spin her on cue. The only plus I can give is they did teach you how to flick your foot. (That subtle extra light kick forward step before you step back that looks stylish when dancing.)I liked the ZUMBA DVDs much better. They taught the steps very slowly, patiently and well even for the most uncoordinated person. Without using those DVDs first, I would have not been able to follow hers at all. I also give an unexpected two thumbs up for Jamiaca Me S'wet DVD. I learned fluidity & to just follow the beat more, even though it is Reggae music.Working out while overly stiffening muscles = overly tight contracted muscles, poor use of body mechanics, poor posture & you're more likely to injure yourself. At first you'll just have very sore muscles (not the normal healthy tear/rebuild kind, but you'll have very sore joints which is never healthy.
