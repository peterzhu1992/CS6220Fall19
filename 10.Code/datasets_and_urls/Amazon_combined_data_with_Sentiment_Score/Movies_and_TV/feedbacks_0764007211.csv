Like Jimmy Stewart before her, worn-out wife and mother Mary Steenburgen wishes that she'd never been born. And like Stewart, Steenburgen is visited by a guardian angel, in this case the western-garbed Harry Dean Stanton. Instead of granting Steenburgen's wish, Stanton shows her what life would be like without Christmas-and that vision is as grim as anything you're ever likely to see in any Holiday film. Throughout the horrendous tragedies heaped upon Steenburgen, we are comforted in the knowledge that Stanton is working in concert with Steenburgen's young daughter. Steenburgen learns her lesson of course, but what a ride!",5,EXCELLENT!!,1119744000,"06 26, 2005",0.1858

Its very dramatic for a Disney family film, but comes out with a happy ending. Mary Steenburgen plays a mom who has completely lost the whole Christmas spirit in her. It takes the help of her six year old daughter along with a guardian angel and Santa Claus to change her mind about Christmas. Great moments in this film portray a slight realistic approach about a family trying to cope with what they can spend on Christmas gifts. As said earlier, this movie also comes with some very dramatic moments in it. Get this film for the whole family and enjoy it for years to come!For some odd reason, this film has been out-of-print on home video for a while, but has been made available again in 1999 on home video thanks to Anchor Bay Entertainment. Its available on standard VHS version, widescreen VHS edition, and also on the DVD format as well.

For adults, there's the grim, ultra-real what-if story that forces viewers to discover what is really valuable in life (in this case, husband and children). For children, there's lots of Santa-magic, trips to the north pole, a guardian angel in Western clothes and more. Some of this is a bit over-the-top even for children (except maybe for the under-fives), and some of it just isn't that good. But there's a lot to like here, and one can be thankful that the filmmakers didn't ruin the movie with casting: the child actress here is adorable. The over-long fantasy parts tend to weaken the effect of the adult story, but it is a story that makes its point and one that can be watched at any season of the year. If you like stories that make you value family, there is (besides It's a Wonderful Life), the movies Mary Christmas, Little House Christmas Special, A Season of Miracles and the novel A Thanksgiving Miracle.

Pretty much the first half hour is nothing but sorrow and misery with one horrible event after another taking place. You start to wonder exactly when it's going to get better.......Not until almost the very end. Maybe the last 10 minutes or so is good. I love Christmas movies, and have seen almost every plot to them out there, but this one still stands as probably the most depressing one ever made. It's like the writers didn't know how to make the ending seem like a big enough turn-around to happiness, so they threw in all the ideas that they had on the table for someone's nightmare Christmas. That's pretty much what happens. The mom (Ginny) is having a hard time getting into the Christmas spirit, so in order to make the ending the happiest possible, they first have to strip her of everything in her life she holds dear; i.e. her husband, son, their home, their livelihood etc. Just way too sad for me.

27,A3LART1Q4VFC2F,764007211,gellerfan gell3334,"[2, 2]","I am going to forego a synopsis of the storyline, which is found on the Amazon and IMDB.com websites for this film.Instead, I want only to share how I found this film transforming and endearing, possessed of heart and thought and what it meant to me; why it has become a must see for me each Christmas.When this Disney film was released in 1985, I thrilled at seeing an unheralded treat (or so I thought)- one to be added to my list of annual Christmas treasures for viewing.Needless to say, I (figuratively) crawled from the theater- stunned by the overall gloomy tenor of the film. Had Disney gone dark? Were the reviews I later read confirming the depressing nature of the film valid, or was I missing something.For a few years, the haunting tale of Ginny Grainger's downtrodden existence, lack of hope and joy at the holiday season, her loss of faith, facing one heart-wrending calamity after another (only at last to be renewed) gnawed at me.And then it was released on videotape, so I went to my nearby rental store and took the movie home to give it another chance. (let me tell you, my wife thought me insane - and still to this day does not get it - refusing to watch it with me).I put it into the VCR on Xmas eve, sat back with a glass of wine and lo and behold! became entranced by the subtle beauty of the performances, the deep spiritual magic of the story and the emotions it brought forth.Somehow, I had earlier missed the tale of faith born anew in the face of one catastrophe after another by Ginny, the central character` of the film.Mary Steenburgen, as the matriarch of a family beset with severe financial problems, struggles against the feelings of joy and hope exhibited by her husband and children, who in spite of everything, believe in the magic of Christmas.Harry Dean Stanton as the angel Gideon, contrives with Ginny's daughter to renew Ginny's Christmas spirit, with the aid of probably the greatest Santa Claus ever filmed on screen, as played by the actor Jan Rubles. If ever there was a Santa Claus, he is it- and the artistry and majesty of Santa's workshop at the North Pole is only as Disney could create it - this is not your Tim Allen in Santa's workshop to be sure.Enduring Ginny's pessimistic outlook on life, and struggling with her as she faces one tragedy after another as engineered by Gideon to help her reach the ultimate crossroads in a crisis of faith takes a measure of patience and strength for the viewer and yet, the ultimate reward, the restoration of her belief in the magic of Christmas is enchanting and heartwarming.As bleak as the canvas of this story is painted, until it's redeeming conclusion, it is wholesome and spiritual, without being overtly religious. It is as dark as the depths of despair suffered by George Bailey in It's a Wonderful Life and ultimately as life assuring as well. If you are not altogether soul-less, you will gasp and sob and come away glowing with sentimentality of it's virtue.

At Xmas her kids and husband are excited but she only worries about money and is brought down even further by people treating her badly.An angel shows up and encourages her young daughter to help find 'the true meaning of Xmas' (a theme which is quite common in Xmas movies). The film then plays out as a cross between It's a Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol. It's effective, but it's not for everybody.

Somehow One Magic Christmas slipped passed me until it was packaged with The Santa Clause/Santa Clause 2 through the Disney Movie Club. Seeing the price for three movies as a bargain, I purchased all three. Now I'm very familiar with the Santa Clause movies, but I knew absolutely nothing about this film. When I finally sat down to watch it, it put me in a comfortable holiday mood that only a choice few Christmas films can do to me. Mary Steenburgen headlines a solid cast of characters as Ginny Grainger. She's a mom who's whole family is down on their luck for Christmas. Her husband has lost his job and with it, their home. Her boss at the supermarket hounds her despite doing everything for him and to top things off, she seems to be the only person not happy that it's Christmas time. Enter Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), a Christmas angel sent by St. Nick to remedy the problems of Ginny Grainger. How does he do it? Through her Santa-believing daughter, Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois). As the story rolls along and more terrible things and one rather traumatic event occur, Ginny loses all hope for Christmas. Can Gideon and Abbie (with a little help from ol' Kris Kringle) save the family's Christmas. You'll have to watch to find out.As stated before, the cast is solid. Two standouts are Gary Basaraba as Ginny's optimistic husband and a young Elias Koteas as a family friend. Special effects are minimal and haven't aged well, but do not distract the viewer from the story.As another reviewer stated, Santa Claus does take on a few god-like qualities, and the magic at the end of the film may turn off some viewers. However, I see this character's development and the events that occur as nothing more than another take on the Santa mythos. A few people might also be turned off by the creepy guy factor of Harry Dean Stanton's Gideon. He hangs around in trees playing a harmonica, dressed in a dark duster and a cowboy hat. The reasons for this are explained in the film, but he does cast quite the shadow as a friendly stranger that may bug some parents. Not talking to strangers should be a well developed concept for children who see this film, but it never hurts to refresh your child once in awhile. There is also a very traumatic event that occurs near the end of the film that is dealt with very tenderly, but may be too intense for very young viewers. Just know that it involves a shooting death of a primary character that is resolved eventually.As for the DVD itself, there is one compilation of movie previews, a Spanish language track, and French subtitles. That's all. There's no extra cartoon or trivia games, so if that's your bag, you're out of luck.So, despite a few minor details like the creepiness of Gideon at times and what some see as the godliness of Santa, One Magic Christmas is a solid family film that I'm sure will be cherished by many for years to come. Sure, it's no A Christmas Story or It's A Wonderful Life, but it's still worth repeat viewings during that most wonderful time of the year.

The main character, Ginny, is caught up in her her own problems and worries. She has lost her Christmas spirit and has forgotten how important her loved ones are to her. On a cautionary note, this film is different from other movies such as &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;The Preacher's Wife&quot; in that the angel seems to be a representative of Santa Claus, setting up good 'ol St. Nick to be a God-like figure. When tragedy strikes the family (not too much detail here so as not to spoil the movie if you haven't seen it yet) the angel takes Ginny's young daughter to Santa Claus. He tells her he can't solve her problem, but that her mother has the power to do it herself.

Its up to Christmas angel Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), Santa Claus, and Ginny's own children to help her recover what she has lost.The movie's plot is certainly dark, and a box of kleenex may be necessary for some scenes. The writing is superb and the acting first-rate throughout.The alternate-reality loop (from when the lights go out to until the lights go back on) is a fairly unique device in mainstream Hollywood films (especially Disney ones).Despite the rather dour situation the Granger family finds themselves in during most of the film, their series of unfortunate events has a very heartwarming - even triumphant - ending.
