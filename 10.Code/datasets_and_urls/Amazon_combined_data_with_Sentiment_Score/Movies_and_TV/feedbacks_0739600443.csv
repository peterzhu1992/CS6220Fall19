Hoping to spend as little money as possible while purusing a local video store, I happened upon this one. All it is, is a narrator with an incredibly boring, insomnia-healing voice give a 35 minute account of Andy's life. While there are several hilarious clips featuring Kaufman, his voice is nearly always drowned out by the super-boring narrator. Considering the pranks and antics of this unpredictable showman (who did not like to be referred to as a comedian), he probably would have laughed his head off at the people who actually bought this video. This video ranks right up there with Andy trying to get ABC to purposefully screw up the reception for his Special. Please, especially if (like me) you're a newcomer, stay away from this one. Go with the &quot;Midnight Special&quot; instead. It's great Kaufman humor and also very clean humor (something you just don't find nowadays).",1,Terrible waste of time and money!,970876800,"10 7, 2000",0.2352

And I'm not blaming them...It's a 35 minute documentary recorded at 6 hr. speed with no hi-fi and looks as if it has been put through a lo-fi inducement device. The material appears to be taken from an NBC special on Kaufman from a few years ago, slightly rearranged and combined with some hideous and inaccurate narration. Also we get to see more Howdy Doody footage that is probably in the public domain, then we do of Kaufman footage. This tape even lifts promo material from the forthcoming Jim Carrey biopic. By all means avoid this tape and stick with something legitimate. I hope the people who made this thing get sued by the copyright holders (NBC, ABC, etc.) so at least I have a collectors item when this thing gets forced off the market. BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK, OR BETTER YET, THROW YOUR 9.95 IN THE GUTTER, YOU'LL GET MORE FROM THAT!",1,NO Tenk You Vedy Much!,944611200,"12 8, 1999",0.0698

And what are you talking about this guys voice I was expecting some weird voice its god dam normal. Plus its worth the price.,3,GOOD NOT BAD,1013558400,"02 13, 2002",0.0895
4,A3PGNYZJXTYBKQ,739600443,Morris B,"[10, 14]",Maybe this is all part of THE JOKE; to get people caught up in the reemergence of Kaufman fame and then to purchase a totally CRUMMY product. HAHAHAHA! I bet Bob Zmuda (Andy's best friend) was a behind this. HAHAHAHA! Just reading the reviews got me to laugh. Part of Andy's act was bombing on purpose. Go back and watch this again or compare the part in the movie when Kaufman wanted the ABC special to look as if it was messing up.
