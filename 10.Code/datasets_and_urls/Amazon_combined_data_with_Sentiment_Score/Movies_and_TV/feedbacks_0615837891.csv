1,AM0Q2JUS910ZQ,615837891,"JEROME W, MARTIN","[0, 1]","THIS FILM IS UNLIKE MANY ONE MIGHT SEE IF ONE IS INTERESTED IN THE CIVIL WAR. THIS 3 DAY BATTLE SOMETIMESIS THOUGHT TO BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE WAR; PERHAPS FROM A PRACTICAL VIEWPOINT (AND PROPAGANDA)IT MIGHT BE, THOUGH I THINK ANTIETAM WAS REALLY THE TURNING POINT BECAUSE SOME WEAKNESSES OF LEESSTRATAGIES SHOWN THRU THERE. LEE WAS LUCKY TO GET HIS ARMY AWAY INTACT THANKS TO A SPINELESSMCCLELLAN. ANYHOW THIS DVD TAKES YOU ON AN JOURNEY ABOVE AND AROUND THE FIELDS OF BATTLE AS THEYARE TODAY, WELL PRESERVED ALLMOST UNCHANGED FROM 1963. THE SKY VIEWS FLYING OVER A FOGGY MORNINGMIST IS EERIE AND YET MESMERIZING. WHEN I VISITED THE PLACE SOME YEARS BACK AND WALKED OVER THEVERY GROUND WHERE SO MANY BRAVE YOUNG MEN GAVE THEIR LIVES FIGHTING FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVED, I FELT A SADNESS CREEP OVER ME; HOW MANY YOUNGSTERS IN THEIR PRIME DIED HERE AS I TROD OVER THESACRED SOIL. I COULD ALMOST HEAR THEM TALKING ABOUT GOING HOME AFTER THE WAR. MANY NEVER DID.FOR SOME REASON I FIND MYSELF EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO THIS PLACE, THOUGH THE WAR WENT ON 2MORE BLOODY YEARS.AS LEE WAS PULLING OUT, THE WORD CAME THAT VICKSBURG ON THE MISSISSIPPI HAD FALLEN, GIVING CONTROLOF THE MIGHTY MISS TO THE UNION, DIVIDING THE CONFEDERACY FOREVER. LEE MUST HAVE SENSED THE WARWAS GOING TO BE LOST. A GOOD MAN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY.THE PHOTOGRAPHY IS BEAUTIFUL; THERE ARE NO RE-ENACTORS HERE. YOU ARE TAKEN AROUND THE BATTLEFIELD AS THE NARRATOR DISCRIBES WHAT HAPPENED AT EACH PLACE. WELL DONE, PRODUCERS, WELLDONE INDEED.

The visuals in the film do look fantastic, but please be aware that this is inappropriate for the hearing impaired.",1,Inappropriate for the Hearing Impaired,1377561600,"08 27, 2013",0.1735

8,AQQLWCMRNDFGI,615837891,Steven A. Peterson,"[2, 2]","Actually, I would give this two scores--a 3 for those already familiar with Gettysburg and a 4 for those not. I can't give a score of 3.5, so I have rounded to 4 stars.For those familiar with the battle, little will be gained by viewing this--other than the very welcome bird's eye view of the battlefield. For instance, the coverage of Pickett's charge doesn't mention the involvement of Trimble's and Pettigrew's forces on the third day.For those not so familiar with Gettysburg, this will be a good introduction. A lot of details are left out, but the basics--from Buford's stand on Day One to &#34;Pickett's Charge&#34; on Day Three--are presented. The stories of Wesley Culp and Jennie Wade provide a certain poignancy to the DVD.So, nice cinematography, a plus. Basic description of the battle--a plus for neophytes and not so much for those familiar with the battle.",4,Good introduction to the battle--from a bird's eye view.,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",0.128
