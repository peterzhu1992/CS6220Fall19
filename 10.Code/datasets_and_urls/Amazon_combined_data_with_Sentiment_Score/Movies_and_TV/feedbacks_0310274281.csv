37,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,310274281,Harold Wolf Doc,"[23, 23]","GIFTED HANDS: THE BEN CARSON STORY could be reviewed as a documentary or at least contemporary historical/nonfiction because of the content. A young boy grows up to be a surgeon. He becomes a gifted doctor at a high profile hospital dealing with the toughest of cases. He performs miracles, and much can be attributed to the encouragement and mothering he received while he was growing up. Mom never gives up on her sons.GIFTED HANDS could also be reviewed as a story where the underprivileged and low achiever makes good. He builds within himself, with much reinforcement from his mother, an ambition and desire for learning. He accomplishes all that is within himself. He surpasses by light years what some expect from him being a fatherless, minority, wrong-neighborhood, disadvantaged sort of kid that is expected to become a burden on society, not a Johns Hopkins pediatric neurosurgery specialist. Boy makes good times ten.IS IT A LOW KEY CHRISTIAN DRAMA? It could be considered that because this boy uses his personal faith, and seeks God's help in overcoming his childhood frustrations and anger. As a neurosurgeon, he continues to use his faith, even admitting to the parents of his patients that he prays daily. No Bible pounding, or heavy handed preaching. As a matter of fact, most of the staunch religious will say this movie is not revealing faith at all. I disagree. It is the faith of a young boy, which grows into a man's inner strength of knowing God as a helper, and in an assuming way, not flamboyant and boastful.REALISM--HONEST IN THE TRENCHES LIVING is what this award worthy story is about. Ben Carson, even with his skills with a surgeons knife, also knows failure, struggle, and life sorrow that comes from a human inability to control every aspect of living. But he never stops trying, and he gets support from some teachers, mom, brother, wife, classmates, and many others along the way. But in the end, it is one man's choice to do his very best, make his life shine and sparkle just like his mother did to floors while scrubbing and cleaning for others.This is one powerful, inspirational, biography of one life overcoming hardship and of becoming an overachiever. Dr Carson has a goodness within always striving to help others.

This question was raised during the interview for one of the two spots (out of some 125 applicants) at John Hopkins University. He added that few doctors are people of faith. He especially found remarkable how the mind could create Handel's MESSIAH, and to do so in two weeks. Carson got the slot. Later, he told a patient that he prayed every day.Carson's work as a pediatric neurosurgeon faced many challenges. At first, his colleagues, animated by prejudices, did not want to greet him. A receptionist suspected that he, an African-American, must be an orderly. The head doctor mistook Carson's medical insight for the stereotyped African-American insolence.The surgical challenges were great. At one time, owing to an absence of critical personnel (and ability to get permission), he had to conduct a lifesaving surgery that, if unsuccessful, would have cost him his career and exposed the hospital to a lawsuit. In another surgery, he had to remove the entire hemisphere of a girl who had uncontrolled epilepsy. He had never done this before, and no one knew the outcome in advance.

The film chronicles key events and influences in his rise from humble origins to professional excellence as one of the world's best surgeons.Carson's life was marked by serious adversity and disadvantage. He overcame these obstacles in the same time-tested manner that all people discover who aim for virtue and accomplishment--the loving encouragement and direction of others, in Carson's case his mother and wife, good choices, hard work, self-denial, and, most important, a reliance upon God.The film depicts a pivotal period in Carson's life during which his explosive and violent temper nearly destroys him. Recognizing his own inability to tame and master his destructive impulses, Carson admits his need for divine help and healing. He remains a committed Christian to this day.While a normal length film like Gifted Hands cannot do justice to the richness and detail of Ben Carson's life, leaving the interested viewer with many unanswered questions, the film does provide insight into the inspiration for Carson's remarkable medical successes and his exemplary character. His life also reminds us that as far as we may get through our own efforts and the support of others (and these are very important factors of course), we need the help, guidance, and wisdom of God even more.",5,Truly inspirational,1337299200,"05 18, 2012",0.4388

Hendrex Rubicon,"[1, 1]","This review is for the movie, GIFTED HANDS, starring Cuba Gooding Jr.I wanted to make that clear because for some reason Amazon has mistakenly grouped all of the reviews for GIFTED HANDS (the movie) with all the reviews for GIFTED HANDS (the docummentary). I think I even saw some reviews here for the book. Just for the record, both the Feature Length Film AND the Documentary of the same name are excellent and both deserve 5 stars. The documentary stars the real Dr. Ben Carson as himself, while the Movie stars Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dr. Ben Carson. Apparently, a number of people have ordered the documentary thinking it was the movie, and others have ordered the movie expecting the documentary. I am suspect that the trouble with these two products is even messing with the ordering process causing people to receive an item they didn't order. This confusion has resulted in a lot of people receiving the wrong product and are therefore dissatisfied - leaving unwarranted bad reviews. I really hope Amazon gets this mistake straightened out because there are a lot of people upset about this and they don't know what is happening.That being said, the FEATURE LENGTH FILM is an inspiring story that is well acted, moving and as far as I can tell, reasonably faithful to the truth. This is saying a lot because movie makers and screenplay writers are notorious for changing the facts to make a story more &#34;interesting&#34; . With a few minor exceptions, the spirit of Ben Carson's personal account of his life is pretty much what really happened. I am glad to find the real story more or less intact here.I would highly recommend this movie, AND THE DOCUMENTARY to anyone who likes a good TRUE story. I completely enjoyed watching this.

65,A1FNW6H983I87V,310274281,Loves To Read Lu,"[0, 0]","This is the life story of Dr. Ben Carson, chief of pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins University and considered the world's best pediatric surgeon. The story begins with Dr. Carson being asked to consider operating on the two sons of a German couple who are joined at the abdomen and skull. No one has ever performed this surgery successfully with both children surviving. The film then flashes back to the childhood of Dr. Carson. He was raised by an illiterate but very loving and determined single mother who married at the age of 13 and was divorced soon after when she discovered her 'husband' was married at the same time to another woman with another family. She was determined that her two sons would not turn out the same way she did. It is an amazing story of this mother and her love and determination. Ben, not realizing he needed glasses, consistently performed way below the other students in class until his mother used all their savings to get him a pair. That, along with her firm hand in making the two boys read two books a week from the library (along with written reports) as well as limiting TV watching to two programs a week turned Ben into the 'student of the year' in 8th grade. Even that, however, was tainted, as a teacher at the award ceremony berated the other students for letting a 'boy of color' with serious disadvantages and a single mother outperform them. The story continues with his achievements and struggles through high school and his scholarship years at Yale and on to his residency at Johns Hopkins. The story then takes us back to the conclusion of the decision whether or not to operate on the German twins. It is an incredible story of someone who not only had the 'gifted hands' needed to be a great surgeon but also the determination, humility and faith to make a life of great service to his fellow humans against great odds. The acting is outstanding. I would encourage everyone and every family to make this a 'must watch'. I would also highly recommendSomething the Lord Made, another story about a great African-American surgeon, Dr. Vivian Thomas, who was born 30 years too early to be able to have the same opportunities as Dr. Carson, but nevertheless made a great contribution to medicine that is still being used today.

His divorced mother dropped out of school in the third grade, works constantly to support her family, suffers from depression, and has to check herself into a mental institution. Upon her return, she sees her two sons' success as hindered by too much TV, and so greatly limits the time they can watch. She also requires that they read two library books/week and give her a written book report. After moving to a better school and getting glasses, Ben becomes a solid-A student and is third in his high school class.

The acting here is emmy worthy from everyone involved. The actress who plays the mother was so outstanding that I forgot that she wasn't really her character. It's a complex role and a important one too. It shows how she escapes her past and helps her children to become something great. Her husband, a drug user is not seen but all to often that is the plague that lays waste to families in this country. Cuba Golding is at his very best here as Ben Carson.
