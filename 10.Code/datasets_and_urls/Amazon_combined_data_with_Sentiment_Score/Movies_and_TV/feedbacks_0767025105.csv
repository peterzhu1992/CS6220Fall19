0,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,767025105,Bruce Rux,"[3, 3]","The best thing about The Avengers is that the series is so diverse, a random grab of any half dozen episodes is sure to bring up at least three you're guaranteed to enjoy. With seven available in this set, the odds increase that you'll pull up four.For those who miss the earlier Honor Blackman crime melodramas in the series, The Murder Market, Two's A Crowd and Dial A Deadly Number will fit their bill. A Surfeit of H2O, The Hour That Never Was and The Man-Eater of Surrey Green provide a bit of sci-fi and action/adventure, and Too Many Christmas Trees - a favorite in anyone's book - is a wonderful psychological suspenser in the espionage/murder vein.But better than all of that is simply the magnificent chemistry between stars Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg, which livens-up even the weakest episodes in the series with wit, humor and a great abundance of charm. Rarely has any show been so graced with two such appealing actors, let alone writers sparkling enough to make adept use of their native talents. There is a depth of feeling, commitment and moral fortitude, in the characters of John Steed and Emma Peel, that is rarely seen anymore, and is sorely missed.Enter the world of The Avengers - or reacquaint yourself, if you're already a fan - and immerse yourself in excellence.",5,Steed Pours Champagne - Emma Sparkles,1020729600,"05 7, 2002",0.6025

Behrens Frank Behrens,"[19, 19]","It is so very good to be able to see the &quot;old&quot; &lt;Avengers&gt; with Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale, not only for its own sake but as an historic document (so to speak) and as a foreshadowing of the greater things to come the very next season when Diana Rigg continued to make television history as Blackman's replacement.First the negatives. These are &quot;live,&quot; studio-bound productions in which lines are flubbed, jailers have all sorts of trouble opening the doors to cells, gun shots do not convince, and fights are obviously tame to prevent injury in these days before films, stunt-doubles, and retakes. Now and then the sound gets fainter as characters move away from the mikes, now and then the film jumps just a bit, and in at least two sequences a pesky fly seems to have been caught by whatever process was being used to reproduce the original image onto tape/DVD.Neither positive nor negative but merely interesting is that Steed has not picked up his ultra-refined characteristics by way of wardrobe, umbrella (until the last episodes), and steel-coated bowler hat. His relationship with Cathy varies from amused tolerance on her part to such manifestations of her annoyance as throwing things at him. She takes things a lot more seriously than Emma will. In fact, there is little of that Avengers banter we so enjoy in the later episodes and consequently not so much of that chemistry between the two.In one surprising moment that Emma would never tolerate, Cathy asks Steed what he wants from the army stores, and he replies, &quot;Nothing you would be willing to issue.&quot; Here she gives him a &quot;you bet your life&quot; smile. (Emma would have killed him, I think.)There are three episodes on each DVD and twelve in all in this '64 series. Set II starts off well with a sci-fi &quot;Build a Better Mousetrap,&quot; pre-echoing many plots to follow. &quot;The Outside-in Man&quot; has a good twist ending and a &quot;Man from UNCLE&quot; place to meet the Top Man. &quot;The Charmers&quot; is the best so far, humorous, having a good plot and the wonderful Warren Mitchell who would twice play the same bumbling Russian agent in the Rigg episodes; and in fact it was remade as &quot;The Correct Way to Kill&quot; with several interesting changes. &quot;Concerto&quot; has the soon-to-be overdone plot of someone trying to ruin East-West relations. &quot;Esprit de Corps&quot; also has a predictable plot but given some broad humor by funny man Roy Kinnear, who plays his scenes with Steed quite well. &quot;Lobster Quadrille&quot; ends the series on a not very glorious note; but it does finish with Cathy going off on vacation, refusing to take on an assignment there, and Steed phoning a female replacement. I believe they knew by that time that Blackman was leaving the series.Please watch these without the foresight of what is to come and try to keep a 1964 frame of mind when this was the hottest stuff on the telly and a female character never had it so good before Cathy Gale blew into town.",4,Historic and most entertaining,953510400,"03 20, 2000",0.2299

The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed's first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed's new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest. These DVD copies are gorgeous.",5,Build a Better Mousetrap and see for yourself,984441600,"03 13, 2001",0.4148

7,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,767025105,Patrick W. Crabtree The Old Grottomaster,"[2, 2]","These are 1960s-era black-and-white British television episodes which much of the contemporary world would surely scorn to watch... but personally I love them.*The Avengers*, essentially a British spy-versus-spy production with certain deviations from that realm, first came to America in 1965 with more highly punctuated action scenes (going to color in 1967) and invested with a new partner for the primary character, John Steed [played by Patrick Macnee] -- that would have been the role of Mrs. Peel magnificently played by Diana Rigg, ergo:Avengers '65 - Set 1, Vols. 1 & 2. But before that, the somewhat less turbulent British TV years had evolved through a cycle of Steed partners, the last of whom came to be the sensual Honor Blackman as anthropologist Catherine Gale, ultimately a 007 *Bond Girl* inGoldfinger... yes, *that* one!I watched every episode of *The Avengers* from 1965 forward as they were originally broadcast (and many times afterwards), and all the 1962-1964 episodes as the videotapes and DVDs have since become available, (and I've reviewed most of them as well.) I am a *The Avengers* nut, to put a point on it. Here are the primary episode details, (each one running for about 52 minutes), for this two-disc set:VOLUME 3*Build a Better Mousetrap* -- Two aging spinstresses don't like it one bit when a (very mild) motorcycle gang (of which Cathy Gale is a member) attempts to use the property next door for some racing fun. Even though the group had obtained the landowner's permission to carry out their foray, the two old women spin a curse on them and their motorcycles subsequently shut down! ...or, is there more to this apparent sorcery? Meanwhile, an atomic scientist and Steed meet in the nearby Hunter's Horn Pub to determine what secret device might be causing some electronic mayhem throughout the district -- murder follows. This is clearly the best episode of the set.Cynthia [Athene Seyer], Ermyntrude [Nora Nicholson], Harris [Harold Goodwin], Colonel Wesker [John Tate], Caroline [Alison Seebohm], Dave [Donald Webster], Jessy [Marian Diamond], Stigant [Allen McClelland], and, Gordon [David Anderson]. The screenplay was by Brian Clemens and the director was Peter Hammond.*The Outside-In Man* -- Steed is assigned to a security detail where he's to guard a former British traitor who now sports diplomatic protection as he represents another nation and is in England to facilitate an important agreement with the British government. A British agent in Steed's organization who had been imprisoned by the traitor for the previous five years has unexplainably been released and now chooses to go after his nefarious adversary -- Steed and Cathy have to prevent this likely assassination.Mark Charter [James Maxwell], Jenkins [Ronald Mansell], Sharp [Philip Anthony], Quilpie [Ronald Radd], Ambassador [William Devlin], Major Zulficar [Basil Haskins], Helen Rayner [Berl Baxter], Michael Lynden [Arthur Lovegrove], Alice [Virginia Stride], Edwards [Anthony Dawes], Guards [Valentino Mussetti and Eddie Powell], and, Butcher [Paul Blomley]. The screenplay was written by Philip Chambers and the director was Jonathan Alwyn.*The Charmers* -- (This episode was later re-made with Diana Rigg under the title *The Correct Way to Kill*.) Both Soviet and British agents are being assassinated in England and Steed suspects that a third party is at work to stir up trouble between the two nations. Subsequent to an agreement initiated by Steed, hostages are exchanged and the two adversarial spy contingents combine resources during a truce of sorts in an attempt to reveal the perpetrator. This is a somewhat frivolous episode which represented a notable shift in the writing themes for the series.Kim Lawrence [Fenella Fielding], Keller [Warren Mitchell], Harrap [Frank Mills], Mr. Edgar [Brian Oulton], Martin [John Barcroft], Betty Smythe [Vivian Pickles], Horace Cleeves [Malcolm Russell], Sam [John Greenwood], and, George Vinkel [Peter Porteous]. The screenplay was written by Brian Clemens and the director was Bill Bain.VOLUME 4*Concerto* -- A Russian concert pianist is sent to London to unofficially break the ice for a trade delegation. The international agreement is jeopardized when the pianist is nefariously framed for murder. This is a good story but it was poorly directed... dull. At least you'll get to hear a bit of nicely-played Chopin and Beethoven.Zalenko [Nigel Stock], Stefan Velik [Sandor Eles], Darleen [Dorinda Stevens], Peterson [Bernard Brown], Burns [Geoffrey Colville], Receptionist [Carole Ward], Polly White [Valerie Bell], and, Robbins [Leslie Glazer]. The screenplay was written by Terrance Dicks (ofDoctor Who: The Brain of Morbius (Story 84)fame) and Malcolm Hulke (an early mentor to Dicks and another major *Doctor Who* screenwriter.) The director was Kim Mills.*Esprit de Corps* -- A rogue faction of Scottish Highland Guards plot to take over London and to rule Great Britain through the revived Monarchy of the Royal House of Stuart! Cathy Gale infiltrates the group after it becomes known that they have executed one of their own. Steed poses as a Brigadier whose interest ostensibly lies in documenting guard history.Private Jessop [Roy Kinnear], Captain Trench [John Thaw, who later starred inInspector Morse - Complete Collection], Brigadier General Sir Ian Stuart Bollinger [Duncan Macrae], Lady Dorothy Stuart Bollinger [Joyce Heron], Mrs. Craig [Pearl Catlin], Sergeant Marsh [Douglas Robinson], Admiral [Hugh Morton], Private Asquith [Anthony Blackshaw], Signaller [James Falkland], Piper [George Alexander], Drummer [Tony Lambden], and, Highland dancer [George Macrae]. The screenplay was written by Eric Paice and the director was Don Leaver.*Lobster Quadrille* -- One of Steed's fellow agents is killed by a crime syndicate of lobstermen. The dead agent left behind an ornate chess piece as a clue to his demise which steers Cathy and Steed toward an Oriental chess-master who appears to be a key member of this smuggling and murder ring. This was Honor Blackman's final episode of *The Avengers*.Mason [Burt Kwouk], Captain Slim [Leslie Sands], Bush [Gary Watson], Katie [Jennie Linden], Dr. Stannage [Norman Scace], Quentin Slim [Corin Redgrave], and, Jackson [Valentino Mussetti]. The screenplay was written by Richard Lucas and the director was Kim Mills.If you happen to be a fanatical enthusiast of *The Avengers* as I am, or even if you simply enjoy older British television presentations, this is a great set for viewing.
