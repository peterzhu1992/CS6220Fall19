0,AQ6J4B5WLGRJ5,738919012,Abert AMY,"[2, 2]","Karajan had an early recording of Bach's Magnificat on CD, with Schwarzkopf, Gedda, Dominguez et al. That was a mono historical recording.In this 1984 New Year Eve Concert, we have a DVD of this piece performed with modern instruments. The soloists are American soprano Judith Blegen, German bass baritone Michael Holl, Mexican tenor Francisco Araiza and Italian mezzo-soprano Irene Molinari, all top soloists of the 1980's.Many reviewers have complained against Amazon for not listing this work in this recording but introduced the Second Violin Concerto as the sole piece of work in this DVD.I report that in a new version of this same release, the cover even escalated this aspect by showing Anne-Sophie Mutter and Karajan, without any marked reference to the Magnificat.I watched the Concerto part with considerable fast forwards, as the performance isn't really as riveting as other Anne-Sophie Mutter recordings (I don't know why).I had to agree that the major artistic and entertainment attraction of this release lies in the Magnificat in D, BWV 243.The soloists are all wonderful - Blegen with an angelic tone, Molinari with an earthly plaint, Araiza firily energetic with Holl sounding plangent and authoritative.The chorus sung tremendously well under Karajan, who conducts from the keyboard.If I had not watched excerpts of this part on Youtube, I would NEVER have known this jewel of a performance hidden in this DVD FOR THE NO 2 VIOLIN CONCERTO.Who would have guessed that it was there?",5,Who would have guessed it was there - look out for Karajan's SECOND Magnificat BWV 243 here!,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",0.322
1,A2OOXUXSS03V3X,738919012,David M. Goldberg,"[1, 1]","My heading refers to the violin concerto and not to the glorious Magnificat. What I find intoxicating about Ann Sophie Mutter's performance is its utterly powerful mediocrity: so potent in fact that it seems to have driven the current Amazon reviewers into a state of intoxication that eliminated their last ounce of critical judgement. I simply would not have recognized this overweight pudding of a sour-puss girl as the ravishing svelte virtuoso whose charismatic personality and unsurpassed musicianly virtuosity has brought me to a state of ecstasy on very many occasions in the concert hall, with an orchestra or with an accompanist. By the time of this performance, she was already 21, eight years after her debut at the Lucerne Festival and 6 years after her first recording with Karajan and the BPO. It is not just that she plays badly here; the fact is that she hardly plays at all. Or putting it another way, what she produces is indistinguishable most of the time from the sounds of the other string instruments in the ensemble, and anyone listening to this with their eyes wide shut and not conversant with the music would guess it to be a suite or a Brandenburg Concerto rather than a full-fledged violin concerto, and a lovely work at that. Are the sound engineers to blame? If they are, then they managed to fool my drunken co-reviewers, as nobody commented on it.Further, the performance of the Magnificat is recorded with what passed for the perfection of the times, although it is a little fuzzy by contemporary standards and lacks Surround Sound. Every instrument and every vocalist is captured with commendable clarity; the orchestral tutti have a gorgeous velvety texture; and the large chorus sounds like a flock of nightingales. I love big-orchestra Bach, and this performance should convert aficionados of minuscule ensembles who scrape and blow at period instruments. The soloists are joyfully competent and clearly love what they have to sing, Their breath control is sorely tested by the drawn out tempi chosen by Karajan for the slow movements, but Araiza and Molinari (who have to bear the brunt of this idiosyncrasy) do a splendid job. Don't misunderstand me on his latter point: what the great conductor does throughout is in harmony with the spiritual and intellectual aspirations of the composer, and I have never heard a finer interpretation of the work in any medium. This is clearly a 5-star performance that, balancing out the 1-star rating of the concerto produces and average score of 3-stars. The triumphal applause that greeted the former and the lukewarm response to the latter says it all.",3,An intoxicating performance,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",0.4167

If you are one of those people who need to have 300 year-old music performed on 300 year-old instruments by 300 year-old people (OK, I exaggerate), you will hate this performance. The Berlin Philharmonic at the peak of their &quot;Karajan sound&quot; capabilities throw the full weight of their symphonic splendour at this Bach program. I love it in its own right. Karajan was never known or liked for his baroque conducting, in fact he was despised for his interpretation of the Brandenburg concertos, but this is still a great, great recording, especially with the exceptional Rias Rundfunkchor performing Bach's Magnificat. Real goose-bump stuff. And we need not talk about the untarnished skills of the young Ann-Sophie Mutter playing in perfect harmony with her great menthor's conducting. If you have a Gardiner or a Hernoncourt or a Herrwhege recording of these pieces at home: go ahead, get this one, it's a guilty pleasure, but it works.As for sound and video quality: all DVDs from this Karajan series are exceptionally good considering that the original material was recorded 20some years ago. They leave nothing to be desired.",5,guilty pleasure,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",0.3202
