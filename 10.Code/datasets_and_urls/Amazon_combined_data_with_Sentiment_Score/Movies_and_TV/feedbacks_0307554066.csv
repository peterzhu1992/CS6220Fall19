This especially prevails in an under girding of belief that integrity, faithfulness, determination and upright morals can result in achievement of goals and overall success in life's pursuits. Although this assertion may be scoffed at or chuckled about, every child needs to see righteousness clearly demonstrated, even if clumsily or in fantasy.",4,UnderDog succeeds,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",0.3085

2,A3S4ISGMFJA2VI,307554066,Fred Roberts,"[8, 10]","Underdog was one of my favorites when I was five years old, and watching the DVD reissues brought back wonderful memories. I ordered these for my son who is five years old as a means of obtaining quality programming in the English language. We are living in Germany where Underdog is relatively unknown. My son was fascinated by the episodes, watching them with wonderful childlike awe, not bored at all. And I enjoyed the occasional references to the adult world (Lucitanic, Hopeless Diamond, etc.). I'm glad I ordered this set.Before ordering I checked the Amazon customer ratings of the individual DVDs. I, too, think it's a shame that the cliffhanger episodes were spliced together. This takes away some of the series' charm, for those familiar with the original format. But there's so much charm going around in this that it almost doesn't matter. Therefore I chose to give five stars. If another packaged set comes out next year I'll probably order it, as well.",5,"Getting the word to Boston, Buffalo and Binghamton!",1030233600,"08 25, 2002",0.3281

I had the VHS videos of Underdog and they were a mishmash of episodes along with what the box notes called cliff-hanger cartoons.The problem with cliff-hanger cartoons is that they continue in multiple episodes or shows (Rocky and Bullwinkle followed that format). So VHS tapes were too short to show entire story arcs. Not so with these DVDs, which combine 'toons from the various VHS videos. Because the art looks similar, viewers often mistake Underdog for a Jay Ward cartoon (Rocky and Bullwinkle, George of the Jungle), but it was made by Total Television.Tennessee Tuxedo, probably Total's second most successful cartoon series (with Don Adams of Get Smart and Inspector Gadget voicing the scheming Penguin, Tennessee) also appears in the cliff-hanger 'toons bonus section of the DVD. At one point Total joined with Leonardo Productions to package their cartoons together for syndication, so you also get the rare King Leonardo Show with Odie Coloney, Biggy Rat and Itchy Brother, Commander McBragg and The Hunter.Three DVDs were produced in this series, and this is a great deal with all three in a box set. They include some of the best episodes like the multi-part Great Zot, presented in its entirety. Underdog featured a narrator and great voice actors, including Wally Cox as humble, loveable shoeshine boy AKA Underdog. Simon Bar Sinsister serves up an endless parade of diabolical devices, along with other aptly-named villains like Riff Raff. An all time classic and regardless of its deviations from the TV format, well-worth owning.",5,Have No Fear,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",0.3018

Apparently, the cliffhanger endings that were in the original require too much of an attention span for today's Ritalin addicted audience, and so these segments have been deleted. Other parts of the cartoon have also been tampered with. And what happenend to Tennessee Tuxedo and other characters that I could have sworn were part of the original show?I love classic animation, but because of the various alterations that were made for this DVD, I cannot recommend it to anyone, in any way, for any reason.",1,A great cartoon has been ruined.,978220800,"12 31, 2000",0.1362

From lovable, humble shoeshine boy to dynamic flying hound, no better television show for childhood could be found. Now that I am older, I find (oh happy glee) that Underdog can once again be seen on my TV. This Collector's Set Edition, so carefully restored, can once again be purchased, to view or just to hoard. But I have a niece and nephew, ages four and six, just about the age to love this canine's cartoon tricks. I think that they will be amazed and find it quite sublime to make friends with an Underdog who lyrically fights crime. So let's lift a toast to Underdog, a hero for all time, and I hope you will forgive me for reviewing this in rhyme.",5,There's no need to fear! Underdog is Here!,1070928000,"12 9, 2003",0.6319

This set would have been alot better if Classic Media kept Underdog as the original TV series. Each Underdog episode was initially shown as a serial with cliff-hangers. In between each cliffhanger was a short like Tennesse Tuxedo. What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The &quot;Cliffhanger episodes&quot; are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father, Ben. Instead you get co-creator Joe Harris' creepy account of a never before seen Underdog episode written for two girls.",2,A Great Cartoon Butchered by Classic Media,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",0.0981

It's been decades since I've seen or heard anything about the show. As such, I was surprised at all the little gems hidden in these classic shows. I loved seeing things like Simon Barsinister The meanest man in the world, creating machines to help him rule the world. Do you remember some of them? Like his machine designed to shrink everyone in the world to 6 inches tall?

9,AA3EC3LKOBD80,307554066,Jonathan Cohen,"[24, 26]","Underdog was one of my all-time favorite cartoons back in the day, and this DVD trio has a nice sampler of the canine crusader's finest. From the three-eyed aliens on Planet ZOT to the metal-munching cloud-men in Silver Thieves and, of course, regular bad guys Simon Bar-Sinister and Riff Raff, nothing ever beats Underdog: I am the hero who never fails/I cannot be bothered with those details! Kids who appreciate a tongue-in-cheek superhero will love Underdog, and adults will go for the Jay Ward-style humor and animation (with that pleasantly-crude look courtesy of the Mexican Bullwinkle artists). Eight Underdog episodes- shown as full 15-minute segments, not the original four-part format- are paired with mini-adventures and the oft-forgotten supporting shorts from the unsung Total TV stable. Of these, I loved both Tennessee Tuxedo- with Don Adams as the plucky penguin and Larry Storch as absent-minded professor P.J. Whoopee, plus quick-and-witty science/history lessons to boot- and Go Go Gophers, a neat little Western spoof with the two brave braves, Ruffled Feathers (he's the one who talks in whoops) and Running Board, as the un-PC Indian heroes. (Was this the inspiration for F Troop?) Presented in surprisingly-good color, with a great cast of New York-accented voices including Adams, Storch, Wally Cox (of course) and Allen Swift (check out his Jimmy Durante voice on King ZOT!), and featuring the most rousing theme song in cartoon history, you'll learn why I've had an Underdog magnet on my fridge for 20 years.This is classic guilty-pleasure stuff for big and little kids alike: It's a bird- it's a plane- it's a frog! (A frog?)/ Not plane, not bird, nor even frog- it's just little ol' me (crashes into airplane)...Underdog!",5,IT'S HIP-HIP-HIP AND AWAY HE GOES!,1103587200,"12 21, 2004",0.4112
10,A2IS1BTDQ6MGX,307554066,Kyle,"[17, 18]","The title of the product gives the impression that the contents will be the complete series of Underdog. Afterall, is that not what the collector would want? However, all in all, it is about 11 episodes, which is sadly disappointing.There is no continuity between the episodes, no obvious reason for the grouping, nothing but a quick assembly and package job in hopes of suckering an old fan into buying just a piece of what he really wants.As has been stated here, there are none of the cliffhanger episodes, which is both a plus and a minus. The little cartoons were most enjoyable, and the handful we are given is a sad sampling and a sorry excuse. However, on the other hand, it is nice to be able to watch an entire episode of Underdog without being interrupted.But again, beware of this product, as it is nothing more than a tease. I suggest not buying it now, but rather waiting until the whole series is released on DVD, to save having to pay for the same thing twice.",2,"Sadly incomplete, another worthless best of",1152662400,"07 12, 2006",0.2131

Yes, the cartoons look fine, if a bit soft. Actually I wasn't bothered as much by the alteration of the cliffhanger endings as I was by the utter ABSENCE of the intros to the other cartoon features. The Commander McBragg episode is MISSING the intro and song. Tennesee Tuxedo is MISSING the intro and song. Go Go Gophers is MISSING the intro and song, etc. For cryin' out loud, what gives?! I can only imagine that the original &quot;title cards&quot; included names and dates that were not deemed acceptable, perhaps due to copyright reasons. Maybe the current owners of Underdog don't have rights to the King and Odie theme music, etc. It's really a shame.This reminds me of the big Disney laser set called Mickey Mouse: the Black and White Years from the mid 90's. Some great cartoons but they are ALL missing their title cards.
