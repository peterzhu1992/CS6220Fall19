0,AIK3W2WFINVZH,310285569,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","This is one of the best films I have seen on God. I can not see how a Atheist can watch this film and still keep to their faith that there is no God. Well I guess... if they just watched the movie with their eyes closed and talked through out the movie and didn't listen, sure, then...I love the part about the Science of Fine tuning. How the Genesis Poem completely fit in with Science and how we are all here is total is a total miracle.Excellent Delivery Rob Bell! Also I just purchased the DVD: The God's Aren't Angry another excellent movie!May God Bless you all!",5,Scientific Proof that God Exists - What do Atheist say now? :),1315785600,"09 12, 2011",0.4047

2,A3O2A2SVT49541,310285569,James Ziessler trebleman,"[0, 0]","This is one of the best, and I mean the best explanations of creation without getting mushy religious and anti-scientific. Often Christian views of creation are so anti-scientific and so prejudice that anyone truly wanting a balanced Chrisitan view that includes your mind is left out. This is the DVD for you. Challenging, thought provoking, even funny and entertaining at times, Rob Bell presents to you the best presentation for creation I've ever viewed. You won't be disappointed.I am presenting this material for viewing in a mini-series to and for non-Christian, seeking-the-truth people. I'm not ashamed to present this DVD to these people seeking God, yet skeptical and cautious of the Christian perspective.",5,Absolutely a must see.

This was a great lecture but what helped make it so effective was his use of the white board. Great stuff, highly recommended.",5,Great lecture,1226793600,"11 16, 2008",0.6901
