I first saw it just a few years after it's release, before I was even 10.Scared the hell out of me! I was DEATHLY afraid of that car.Even now, well over 20 years later, I still love it. I would like to own it someday. While some reviewers have told some of the best scenes, I'll just leave that out for those who haven't seen it yet.I can definitely say kids will probably get scared over it. It might even give them nightmares. That car is VERY creepy and the sounds it makes...oh my god.Terrific job with the car and the suspense.

In my perusal of horror flicks here on Amazon, I happened across this particular little bit of cinema and was taken aback: My subconscious childhood memories stirred with recognition of a black, evil-looking car and James Brolin on a motorcycle. Was this really the same movie?Of COURSE it was...and I was delighted to see it on disc...I ordered it immediately (expedited shipping, of course) and gleefully watched it as soon as it arrived.THE CAR and DOGS, running their courses through late-night double features throughout my childhood, are largely responsible for my love of horror films. It's in several ways what you expect from a low-budget, 70's horror film, but this one in particular had a little extra panache, some undefinable trait that makes you (or, upon viewing as an adult, made ME) recall it when you're driving alone on some deserted stretch of highway.I believe this movie is very underrated, and that belief is strengthened by the following that it has. The acting is solid, with a good cast of known (or at least up and coming at the time) performers, the cinematography is excellent (I do agree with another reviewer: SEE IT IN WIDESCREEN), the music lends just the right amount of atmosphere without overpowering, and the overall feel of the film is just...well, it's spooky.You can't beat the combination of an unexplained predator terrorizing a small, isolated town where the local law must circle the wagons and deal with it...especially when the predator is supernatural in origin, and the script cleverly weaves religious undertones into it's mystique, as well as a goodly amount of characterization for those challenged to combat the evil...all excellently acted and played out for us in a different but very relatable version of good vs. evil.Whereas it may not be on anyone's top 50 greatest horror film list, I would highly recommend THE CAR to anyone who wants to have fun watching a movie, enjoy a good story, and have that little creepy feeling at the back of their neck.",4,Never thought a blaring air-horn could conjure such memories...,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",0.2428

Now that was the &quot;edited for tv&quot; version. This IS WAY better, still love the horn, and the roar of the engine as it speeds by. Now if you are a Knight Rider fan, the cars &quot;ending&quot; was used in the first apperance of &quot;Karr&quot; (Knights All Roving Robot). They used the stock from this movie, to represent Karr flying off the cliff to his end to his destruction as well.I am glad to see The Car on video, outstanding quality. I prefer the &quot;wide screen&quot; because it shows more of what is going on around in the scene. Huge difference then the one I saw on TV.Anyways, this is a great movie for all you &quot;Machines vs. Man&quot; horror movies.

4,A2582KMXLK2P06,764006770,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Car is about, well, a mysterious black car out in the desert that comes out of nowhere to terrorize people. Apparently this car doesn't come with a driver. Believe it or not, despite my love of horror movies, I somehow went through life never having heard of the Car until last night. Now I believe for the most part this movie has dated horribly and isn't nearly as frightening as it once was (with several moments of overlong dialogue usually taking place inside the police station) but there are a few scares that are entirely worth it.One is easily when the woman returns home, walks inside, and you see the headlights of the black car outside the window preparing to plow through the house and create what to me is clearly the most exciting moment in the entire film, and two is when the one cop played by James Brolin enters a garage and is surprised to see that the black car somehow got inside, and when he goes to unjam the doors the car gives chase. This is sort of a hilarious moment too. Of course, without spoiling it, the way the car is eventually destroyed and the rather frightening devil-like image we see in the smoke is another highlight. Oh and of course the suspense that occurs whenever a gust of wind mysteriously comes out of nowhere... we know what this means! Better run!!!Also, gotta love the way people talked back in the late 70's always finishing sentences with why dontcha! which reminds me of a certain rock album by West, Bruce and Laing from the early 70's. Sometimes the car picks up speed in a way that I believe is unnatural, and this occurs in a few other instances as well, but I'm not 100% sure it's fake since it's possible the car really is picking up speed in such a way and it's legitimate.The only thing I hate about this movie is when the car chases people around, but instead of seeing them dying, the film skips over the actual suspense so all we see are the people lying in the dirt when we *should* be seeing the dramatic suspense of them getting hit, flying in the air and then hitting the dirt which is a LOT better, not to mention more realistic. I guess this is entirely due to it being a late 70's movie, who knows. It makes for some unintentionally funny moments, such as when the teens riding their bikes get hit by the car and fly off their bikes. The moment you see people getting hit compared to what happers afterwards in the very next scene with them hitting the ground never quite matches up.Overall, well to be honest I like the Car, but thank goodness the second half shows a drastic improvement with more car chases and less talking, otherwise I wouldn't have been so generous with my 4-star rating. I do feel however, that James Brolin would go onto better roles such as in the Amityville Horror (one of the best horror films of all-time) and that this is more like a stepping stone for him.",4,James Brolin battles a car,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.2311

One of which, I suppose, was that I first saw this &quot;B&quot; horror flick at the neighborhood theater as a child. Yes, it scared me then and makes me smile now.&quot;The Car&quot; is so extravangantly cheesy as to be almost surreal. To really understand the greatness of &quot;The Car,&quot; one must compare it to John Carpenter's &quot;Christine,&quot; another haunted car film based on one of Stephen King's weakest novels. I've seen &quot;Christine&quot; once and really don't care to view it again. I've seen &quot;The Car&quot; many times and will watch it every chance I get.Accurately noted by several reviewers, &quot;The Car&quot; is really &quot;Jaws&quot; on land. This souped up automobile is a sleek black Lincoln possessing a fog horn and a bumper the size of Wilford Brimley's mustache. It runs over bikers, hitchhikers and tuba players with hungry ease, tormenting the local yokel police force with demonic glee. The cast is the key here, with small town policemen James Brolin, John Marley and Ronnie Cox joining forces with dynamite expert R.G. Armstrong to corner The Car and blow it kingdom come. These actors have been around the block a few times in films far better than &quot;The Car,&quot; but their experienced presence adds a note (albeit a small one) of respectability to the precedings.But before this salty crew goes after the metallic Beezlebub beast, The Car must terrorize a high school band, Brolin's hometown squeeze Kathleen Lloyd (whatever happened to her?) and several unlucky travelers in the wrong place at the wrong time. Needless-to-say, car insurance companies were left mightily frustrated after The Car paid a visit to Santa Ynaz.I don't know why The Car likes to drive in the desert, just as I don't know why it seems to have a crush on James Brolin, teasing him unmercifully while slowly picking off his crew one by one. I do know that the car chases in this film are tremendously exciting. The direction and editing is crisp. Leonard Rosenman's musical score is above average. And the final confrontation, while laughable in its epic excess, is memorable.&quot;The Car&quot; is a fun movie, glorious in a &quot;B&quot; movie comic book kind of way. It's &quot;Creature From the Black Lagoon,&quot; &quot;The Omen,&quot; &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; all rolled into one hilariously transcendent package.

14,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,764006770,Daniel Jolley darkgenius,"[1, 1]","Every so often a movie comes along that is just better than it has any right to be. The Car (from 1977) is one of those movies. Summary-wise, it doesn't sound like much at all. Basically, you've got a killer car haunting the streets of a desert town, and James Brolin stars as the law man who has to find a way to end the car's reign of terror. That's it, really. You also have the fact that no one could come up with a less mundane title than The Car. It turns out, though, that the title suits the movie quite well, as this film really is all about the car (a custom Lincoln Mark III). It's a sleek, seductive, darkly charismatic, made-in-the-USA monster of a vehicle. The king of 1970s cinematic automobiles, it could eat Herbie for lunch and scare the wax right off of Christine.A couple of bikers are the car's first victims, but word doesn't really spread until the car takes out an annoying French horn-playing hijacker. Local explosives dude and wife-beater Amos Clements (R.G. Armstrong) is the first to witness the vehicle in action, but it isn't long before most of the men on the police force have seen it, as well - with an increasing number of them not living to tell about it. When Wade Parent (Brolin) has to step in to the shoes of the sheriff (who won't be needing those shoes anymore), it's up to him to devise some plan for bringing the unknown driver to justice. Yeah, an elderly Indian witness says that she saw no one driving the thing, but that couldn't be true, now could it? With his second in command choosing that time to fall off the wagon, Wade definitely has his work cut out for him. Among other things, he's got a local school marching band out practicing on the town's parade route. Personally, I don't think it's a good idea to march dozens of kids up and down the middle of a public road at any time (even though Lord knows they need the practice), but it's especially dangerous when your town is completely at the mercy of a killer hot rod Lincoln.There are an awful lot of things that go boom in this movie. Apart from blowing up one car before it hardly has a chance to even hit anything, the special effects are pretty darn satisfying (especially given the film's age). Through it all, the killer car shows no sign of a single scratch. Heck, you can't even shoot this thing with a shotgun and leave a mark - this is one tough horseless carriage. Cursing the car out seems pretty effective, but believe me when I say this is only a temporary solution. What's a person to do when even the comfort of your own home doesn't guarantee your safety? Personally, I would recommend moving to the left or right when being pursued by an evil car, but everyone in this movie seems to think their only choice is to try and outrace the vehicular behemoth (whether on foot, on a bike, or in a car).The ending is a little cheesy (surprise, surprise), but I actually enjoyed this film quite a bit. James Brolin actually turns in a decent performance, you've got a fairly significant body count, and the car is just relentless in its attacks. How do you stop something like this, especially when you begin to suspect the driver may be more than a normal man (and that's assuming the car actually has someone at the controls to begin with)?

I think the scariest scenes are these: First, the part where the police officer is guarding the parade and you see a brilliant flash in the distance, indicating the car's windshield (funny, being that the windshield didn't appear to be glass). Second, the part where James Brolin's girlfriend talks on the phone is chilling. She just keeps talking while the minute headlights just keep getting bigger and bigger until it plows through her living room, killing her.I'm surprised a sequel was never made so we could find out where this car came from.

Instead of piling on the blood and gore, like too many horror films after HALLOWEEN would do, THE CAR is more of a suspense shocker based on supernatural themes, predating the Stephen King-based CHRISTINE by six years.As has been mentioned, THE CAR is a long, black, and quite frankly evil limousine that has its sights set on the town of Santa Ynez in southwestern Utah. James Brolin is the town's deputy sheriff who must cope with and stop this limousine before it kills any more people (in the film's opening sequence, it actually kills two cyclists in Zion National Park). What he WON'T believe in, despite the imploring of his fellow deputy (Ronny Cox), is that this car doesn't have a driver but rather is possessed by a demonic force. When it chases a local schoolteacher (Kathleen Lloyd) into a cemetary, it won't barge through (it nevertheless succeeds in killing her in her home). Brolin still doesn't believe in it even after the film's fiery climax.Though not necessarily blessed with originality, being as it is a combination of THE OMEN and DUEL, THE CAR nevertheless moves with velocity, thanks in large part to an ensemble cast that includes John Marley, R.G. Armstrong (a Peckinpah regular), Roy Jenson, and John Rubinstein. Director Elliot Silverstein, whose credits include CAT BALLOU and A MAN CALLED HORSE, makes the most of the plot with very good special effects, including the explosive finale; and he is helped by a good score from Leonard Rosenman (Oscar-winner for adapting music for Kubrick's BARRY LYNDON in 1975), which incorporates the ominous Gregorian chant Dies Irae.Though not a masterpiece per se, THE CAR is nevertheless far better than some might give it credit for.

It was captivating then, and it grasped my attention when i watched it today. The Car is a suspenseful little film, with quite solid acting, and an eerie atmosphere although 90% of the action takes place in the daytime, when the vast skies are bright, blue, and clear, and the dirt, and desert cinematography are brilliant and picturesque... maybe thats what gave me an unsettling feeling, that somewhere in this small, slow paced, quiet, desert town, something indestructible, fast, and evil appeared, in the daylight...The Car is, in my opinion, what a good horror flick is about; suspenseful moments, good music, acting and camera angles, and especially in which that it frightens us without the overwhelming use of purposeless shock- violence that overflows the majority of modern day horror films. Now, i really dig horror films and all genres of film, but nowadays i really look forward to being scared by atmosphere, concept, story-line, and a build up of suspense, kinda like a Steven King short story..No CGI here, no explicit gore, just conjured up notions that some possessed car is running over people, (all we usually see is white sheets with some blood on them) and that makes it more frightening, but we do see the car killing people... the fact that this vehicle, which physically looks evil, is tearing through this town unmercifully. The killer in this movie is solid steel, gas and rubber, and it makes you think, that as human beings we are just mere flesh and blood, and that it's pretty hard to fight a crazed vehicle..HaHaHaHaThere are some pretty good performances here, actors with expressive, facial expressions like James Brolin and his girlfriend, and supporting roles with Ronny Cox, and John Marley from the Godfather, plus, some really cool stunt scenes, great sound effects... and that damned horn!!!If you like atmospheric, creepy 70's horror films, i recommend The Car... it's a film classic.",5,Nightmares on wheels...

I still know garbage when I see it, but some things just do not have the same feel anymore either. Such is the case with The Car. I suppose that's natural, but I still have somewhat of an affinity for this movie. When I was kid, I was scared of The Car. It seems rather bland now, for sure, but back in the ole days....The Car is about a mysterious car that kills people for no apparent reason whatsoever. In the same vein as Duel and Christine, The Car comes across in a mysterious fashion in the sense that we do not know who is driving the car, and we do not know why the killings are taking place. Then again, does it matter? Isn't that the point? No motive makes it scarier that way and it's better theater. After all, when things get spoon-fed to us and explained to us, what's left for the imagination? Just take Rob Zombie's inferior Halloween remake for example. Who cares why Michael Myers acts the way he does? Who cares why he marked Laurie Strode for death? Does it make it better for us to know why? No, it just takes the horror right out of it when this happens. The Car does not have this problem, and even though it is confined by its own self-imposed limitations, it has a certain charm that allows the movie to work on some levels.Indeed, The Car does a pretty good job of letting the imagination run wild, at least to a certain point. True, it doesn't take long for the savvy horror movie fan to figure things out, but there's often a kind of beauty in the simplicity of it all. I do not want to make out that The Car is some kind of superior horror movie because it's not. I'm sure as hell not drunk enough to give it five (5) stars. Yet, it stills has a certain identity that makes it worth watching. You could do far worse than watching The Car on a late Saturday night. The acting is okay, and the production values are good, but if for nothing than the nostalgia of it all, there is a reason that I like The Car. Does it scare me now? Certainly not, but it takes itself seriously, and there is a certain degree of suspense and style which is about all you can ask for anymore when it comes to horror movies nowadays...hell, you can't even get that in today's horror movies.In conclusion, I affectionately give The Car 2.5 Stars although it probably deserves only two (2). Of all the automobiles run wild movies, I'd rank them as follows: (1) Duel, (2) Christine, (3) The Car and (4) Maximum Overdrive. Still, with that being said, I'd rather watch The Car any day of the week than any of today's trash. I don't know what that says for today's movies, but it aint good, and I'm certainly not the only one.

Heck, its ranked high with me when it comes to 70's Cult Horror. The main reason for this, its mysterious. Plain and simple. You never know where the car comes from or why 'IT' does what it does. I stress the word, 'IT', because I'm not even sure if 'IT' has a demon driving the car. My guess is that the car IS the demon. A demon disguised in the form of a car. How awesome is that! You only know that it's purely and simply evil. It kills because it can. It is if Michael Myers were to be reinCARnated, he would be THIS car. 'The CAR' might not be every horror fans cup of tea; maybe because these days, it just seems everyone has to have all the answers. Everyone needs a backstory to everything. Well, sorry, that's not what Horror is always about in some cases. The mystery to a scary story is what makes it horrific! 'The CAR' is perfect for building tension, too.

No one was able to understand how it sliced a home in half 5 feet off the ground with no apparent ramp. At another point in the movie it does a fishtail turn to the side and rolls over two police cars flattening them and kills the cops inside, only to wind up back on its wheels and it keeps going down the road, with barely a scratch. In the end they decide to blow up a whole canyon to burry the thing since it has killed off most of the cops in the sleepy little town.

So many victims and so little time, kind of reminds me of an old computer game called Carmageddon.This was a movie that was made back when big budgets were not always needed to make a good movie. The movie does not clearly dictate if anyone is in the car or not, but kinda hints that no one is. This movie might even be what inspired Steven King to write Christine.

Teenagers Pete Keil and Suzie Pullbrook's leisurely early morning bike ride is rudely interrupted by a spectral black sedan which crushes Suzie against a guardrail and knocks Pete screaming off of a high bridge. Subsequently, it also brutally runs down a hitchhiker.The local police, led by Sheriff Everett Peck, attempt to deal with the situation. But when Peck becomes the car's fourth victim in a hit and run right outside of the police station, Deputy Wade Parent must step up to the challenge. As the son of a sheriff himself, Wade has a lot to live up to. He's a recent divorcee, with custody of his two daughters and is also dating their teacher, Lauren Humphreys. Everyone takes Everett's death pretty hard, and with Wade as sheriff-by-default, he makes it the personal mission of Santa Ynez's police department to bring the mysterious motorist to justice.But the intimidating sedan is more than meets the eye (and no, that doesn't mean it's a Transformer). After terrorizing Lauren's class and chasing them into a cemetery, where it refuses to follow, a high-speed police chase ensues wherein the car proves not only bulletproof, but apparently indestructible, as it takes out two police cars using its own momentum by doing a barrel-roll over them and crushing them. Wade himself becomes convinced there may not even be a driver in the thing after all, especially after he and he alone gets a glimpse past the car's tinted windows...The Car is what modern horror movies wish they could be. Now, granted, the idea of an evil, driverless car (a customized black Lincoln Continental) running around killing people is more than a bit silly. But what made me really like this movie was the manner in which the human characters confront the situation. Naturally, they initially assume the car has a human driver, and go about attempting to stop him as they would any other lunatic with vehicular homicide on his mind. But after evidence surfaces that this car isn't what it seems to be comes to light, they change their tactics drastically.There's no Nudge nudge, wink wink self-referential humor or even any real comic relief characters (except for the hitchhiker at the start, who is actually funny and exits the picture before he has a chance to become even the least bit annoying), and everyone generally plays it totally straight, making the absurd plot work.

The plot device of the possessed vehicle has been handled better in several films, most notably &quot;Christine&quot;. &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;The Wraith&quot; and &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; also offer up better thrills-on-wheels than &quot;The Car.&quot;The cast is fair, and the sets either shot on location or non-existant. In other words, the lion's share of the movie's meager budget obviously went into the construction of The Car and its stunt doubles. The Car itself is in intriguing design, and could qualify as a demonic ride, but ultimately one must wonder at how dangerous The Car really is. Sure, it's indestructible. Sure, it drives over people. But is it really any scarier than the wheelchair that chases Trish van Devere down the stairs in &quot;The Changeling&quot;?Bottom line, The Car, as a villain, is about as scary as a Dalek. Sure, the Daleks could kill people and battle Doctor Who, but they couldn't climb stairs. At the end of the day, they were just funny robots with a plunger for a hand. As for The Car, it seems to me that most of its victims could've just jumped behind a tree or something, or otherwise just GOTTEN OFF THE ROAD.And when it comes to motivation, the movie is all at sea. The Car comes out of nowhere, and attacks for no reason. The only real motivation we see is when The Car runs over people who yell or shoot at it. Beyond that, there is no reason in evidence for The Car to be picking on the inhabitants of this rinky-dink little podunk town in Utah.As for suspense, the filmmakers did fairly well. The chases are nicely done, and The Car is made as menacing as possible. I did particularly like that The Car is not seen fully until it's attack on the parade grounds. Up until then, we only see glimpses of The Car, or static shots that do not show the whole vehicle.

57,A190KRNWI4E0H,764006770,Michael Ciardi,"[2, 2]","1977's The Car is a peculiar film, but I mean that in a good way. First of all, there's no denying that Jaws played a huge role in the theme of this picture, right down to the da-dant, da-dant, da-dant cadence to the music. Okay, it's not a shark that's devouring unsuspecting people, but the car has an even more nefarious agenda--it kills for pleasure, and for revenge. James Brolin stars, and although he's undoubtedly responsible for some of the worst perfromances in modern cinema (take a look at his acting in The Amityville Horror if you don't believe me), his acting here suits the film's overall mood. Ronny Cox also delivers an unusual performance; he seems to be sullen and brooding in almost every scene, even when being filmed in deep focus.The star, of course, is the car itself, who seems to be driven by an unknown entity from hell. Is it the devil? Or perhaps one of his minions? The film never tells us, but we know that the car doesn't like hallowed ground, nor does he appreciate getting flipped off by drifters who play the French horn. The car's obsession with Brolin is never quite explained. I mean, the vehicle has an opportunity to do away with the sheriff more than once, but instead decides to taunt him. Well, these plot holes represent minor bumps in the road for the car. It's difficult to pinpoint why this little film resonates in your mind after you've viewed it, but it's one of those films that actually improves upon multiple viewings.

I missed this film when it was first released, but it was apparently overshadowed by STAR WARS. THE CAR is nevertheless one of the great movies of the 1970's, up there with JAWS, DUEL, THE BIG WEDNESDAY, and APOCALYPSE NOW.This film has a tense quality throughout, with many scenes shot in complete silence, keeping the viewer in anticipation as to where the car will strike next and who will be its next unfortunate victim. There is no back story; no-one knows where the mechanical fiend originated from. It just appears one day, bent on the destruction of a small desert town, casually picking off its inhabitants and any hitchhikers passing through.James Brolin plays the New Mexico town's sheriff, Wade Parent, who relentlessly pursues the car, trying to obtain a licence plate or a description of the driver. Roadblocks are set up, but the car dissappears without a trace following each bloody incident. The question on Wade's mind is: are they dealing with a homicidal maniac - or some dark phantom, a demonic otherworldly apparition?Of all the horror films based on 'killing machines', THE CAR (1977) is one of the best. Perhaps not as good as DUEL (1971), it ranks alongside CHRISTINE (1983) and MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (1986)). Closely following are THE BLACK CADILLAC (2002), THE AMBULANCE (1990), TRUCKS (1997), THE WRAITH (1986), and ROADKILL (2001, aka JOYRIDE).Disc features: Widescreen Presentation; Full-Frame Presentation; Theatrical Trailer; Talent Biographies.Cast: James Brolin, Kathleen Lloyd, John Marley, Elizabeth Thompson, and Ronny Cox (DELIVERANCE).Director: Elliot Silverstein (A MAN CALLED HORSE).",4,Relentless Machines,1083888000,"05 7, 2004",-0.337

69,A2QDD6OWIAEBED,764006770,Paul Aragon krakatoa1883,"[0, 0]","Up yours with a splintered fiddle!The Car is the Quintessential mid 70's monster movie, it's man verses thing done in such a way that it could only have come out in that tiny window of great transition in American cinema. Finally dead was the last golden era of Hollywood where the directors had free reign, killed by a social culture that no longer wanted to do much more then cheer for a winner. The shame of Watergate, and Vietnam had caused the thinking persons film to become little more then an afterthought while a world of escapist fantasy took over the pulse of American movie going culture. The three nails in the coffin were Rocky, Jaws, and then finally Star Wars as a coup de grass. The car rose out of these ashes not so much as a phoenix, but more as a mocking bird emulating the staggeringly successful plot points of Jaws tooth and nail, up to and including a climatic finish in which a giant fire devil envelopes the sky when the car explodes at the ending. The big problem of course is that the fear of sharks is a very universal primal fear shared by all of man kind across the globe, whereas demonic driverless cars is probably a fear shared by a mere handful of souls on Earth, and even these people would be mentally fragile to say the least. Nonetheless, The Car has just enough atmosphere and quirky charm that it remains til this day, a highly entertaining film to watch. Now in rating a film like this one, it is best to realise exactly what it is going in. You should not rate it along side cinematic masterpieces like Ben Herr, The Godfather, or Gandhi. The Car is a pure straight line horror film in which the monster is the main character, and outside of the obvious heroic alpha male lead, we get to sit back and watch all the other side characters get taken out one by one. It is therefor a film that unpretentiously aspires to be nothing beyond pure bubble-gum, and as such, the taunt 92 minutes is peppered with 13 deaths, giving the viewer the enjoyment of watching an average of one person get ran down every seven minutes. Along with all this fast paced action, there is some painfully funnly looking sped up Laurel and Hardy like car chase footage, kooky characters with silly dialog, really aweful looking high waist polyester pants, and a Marshall drumming saturated soundtrack which barrows its main melody from Hector Berlioz Symphony Fantastic. ( Just like with The Shining ) The main things going for this movie are the great New Mexico desert location, the use of great character actors like R.G. Armstrong, and Ronny Cox, but mostly, the coolest looking car ever put on film. The Car itself uses the body of a black 60's Lincoln Continental with a cropped and lowered roof, dingy orange tinted windows, and a rounded two fanged bumper that looks like it was lifted off of a 1930's pick-up truck. Unfortunately the US version of The Car is quit pricey, that is why I suggest getting a zone-free DVD player and buying the British copy of the film which plays on PAL 2,4,&5 signals. I own this British copy myself and can testify that the picture quality looks great. Since films like The Car, The Stepfather, Hardware, Innocence, Last House on Dead Ends Street, Santa Sangre etc. either cost too much to own an American copy of, or flat out do not exist in NTSC, owning a region-free DVD player is a must for any discerning film lover. Finally I suggest watching The Car with Race With The Devil as a double bill, or to play The Car at any gathering including as background footage at a party.P.S.

While the movie faded into obscurity pretty fast after its release (I remember seeing it on network TV in '77), it deserves to be rediscovered by a new generation of indie horror fans.On one end of the battlefield here we have the title character, a Satanically-possessed auto bent on causing destruction and mayhem in a small desert town. Arrayed against it are a number of townsfolk, led by Wade Parent (James Brolin), as well as a just-passing-through hitchhiker (21 Grams' John Rubinstein) who's in the wrong place at the wrong time and almost gets run down. Yeah, that's pretty much the entire plot, as the townsfolk try to think up inventive ways to outsmart the car, while the car comes up with increasingly clever ways around the townsfolk's ideas.With a plot this simple, it's all about character and script, and writer Michael Butler (The Gauntlet) delivers with style. Witty, fast-paced, and action-packed, Butler's script gives Silverstein (Cat Ballou) a whole lot to work with, and he does what he can given the flick's basement-level budget.

84,A384P5XYDRGBCF,764006770,Sherlock,"[1, 1]","This review is for:THE CARStudio: Universal StudiosDVD Release Date: May 6, 2008Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1Run Time: 97 minutesI've just seen this 1977 movie for the first time and must say that it is fun, exciting and suspensful to watch. It features a demonically posessed car attacking travelers along roads in the Southwest desert, so there is a lot of action and several tense scenes. Many people die but there is not explicit goriness like there is in today's films. The victims' bodies are found and James Brolin stars as a cop trying to get to the bottom of this and apprehend the culprit. Soon he, his loved ones, and the local police are also attacked, and they come to realize that they are dealing with something that is supernatural.Some things are cheesy and unintentionally funny for people in our day, the acting isn't always the greatest and not everything makes logical sense, but this is still a good story and a fun action movie and worth watching again when in the mood for such.The video and audio quality of this DVD are OK but the only extra is the theatrical trailer.",4,Fun movie that is re-watchable,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",0.0189

The main reason for my review is to dissuade people from buying the 70+ dollar rip-off DVD offered here. It's burned from the VHS version and not worth 1/100 of the asking price. I'm sure the studio will get around to releasing this on DVD for real, it'll be worth the wait.***Update*** 11-17-07Buy the real DVD from Amazon.UK for about $15.00 US!http://www.amazon.co.uk/Car-James-Brolin/dp/B000C4ETBU/ref=pd_bbs_1?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1195298793&sr;=8-1It will be region 1 but you can get a region free DVD player for between 30 and 60 dollars.Philips DVP5140 Multiformat DVD Player with DivX, MP3, Windows Media SupportYou'll still be ahead of the game compared to buying a DVD here, of dubious origin.

I watched the DVD from under a blanket as well. Despite bad acting, a dumb script, and some looooong parts with no action, the movie really manages to create a sustained feeling of dread that never lets up until the (admittedly hokey) end. The cinemetography and special effects are great, and George Barris' Car is really menacing looking (See Barris TV &amp; Movie Cars in books- it has a short section on it), and a better actor than most of the stock cast.

89,AG4OWT0G254FH,764006770,Tom Potter,"[0, 0]","This has always been one of my favorites from when I was growing up. For some reason, I've always had a ball whenever I've watched this film over the years, enough that I purchased one of the ERTL die-cast 1:18 replicas sitting on the bargain clearance shelf at Target some years ago. The replica still sits on my desk to this day, almost staring at me as it did at James Brolin in their first confrontation.The summary of this particular gem of a film is particularly simple. To paraphrase a local TV listing from a recent airing some months ago, A driverless car terrorizes a small town in its thirst for helpless victims.Is it oscar-worthy cinema? Not at all as I've always felt this film is a wonderful example of what suspension of disbelief at the movies is all about. Is it worthy of a Mystery Science Theater 3000 follow-up movie or TV episode? Considering its overall cheesiness and dopey cast of characters, absolutely!Seeing as this campy classic is making a re-emergence on to DVD, I hope that it's given a good treatment. Anchor Bay did a really nice job with their long out-of-print release (particularly with the 5.1 sound mix) so I hope this release gets similar treatment with both picture and sound.In my opinion, this is one to get if you're a DVD collector. Purchase it and enjoy the fun as it's a fun glimpse at the '70's, not to mention it's one heck of an amusing ride (pun intended).",5,An old favorite soon to re-emerge on to DVD,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",0.3706
