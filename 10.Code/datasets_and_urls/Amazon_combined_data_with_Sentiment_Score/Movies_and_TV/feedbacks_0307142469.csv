But when Frosty explains to him that he will melt if it gets too hot, they decide that it's up to them to help him get to the North Pole, so he won't ever melt. On their journey they meet many new friends, and adventures, but they also have to avoid the evil magician, for he has decided that he wants his magic hat back, even if he has to melt Frosty to get it.While the other Rankin / Bass holiday movies such as RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER and SANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN, are filmed with clay-type animation, FROSTY THE SNOWMAN is not. It is done simply in the form of a regular cartoon, and even so, it is still one of the most enjoyable holiday movies for children of all ages. Frosty is a kind snowman who wants to please the children more than anything. Karen (the main child chracter) loves Frosty so much, and will do anything to help him. And Hocus (the rabbit who belongs to the evil magician) is very imaginative and intelligent. As well as a hilarious addition to the cast.

When the temperature starts to rise, Frosty hitches a ride on a freight train bound for the North Pole.

17,A2UBSGFCP2QFNV,307142469,Greg Ehrbar 'MouseTracksOnline',"[1, 1]","For more about Rankin/Bass and Rudolph, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.Frosty the Snowman came along in 1968, when the small New York-based Rankin/Bass production company was proving itself in a marketplace dominated by Hollywood animation giants with Saturday morning series (King Kong), feature films (The Daydreamer, Mad Monster Party) and other specials (Cricket on the Hearth). Like all of their weekly series, Frosty was done in what is now called 2-D or cel animation. Almost all of their animation was done in Japan, and this was one completed at Mushi Studios.The animation isn't much more fluid than in their Animagic productions, but it works very well even by today's standards, in which flash is becoming so prevalent in TV cartoons. What makes it stand head and shoulders over most specials is its unerring simplicity, the voice cast (led by Jimmy Durante, Jackie Vernon and Billy DeWolfe) and the rich musical house style by Maury Laws. More than anything else, perhaps, the design by Paul Coker, Jr. comes across most dramatically in hand-drawn animation and makes Frosty look like a Christmas card come to life.Watching the crisp, linear Coker images (which resemble his work for countless greeting cards and especially MAD magazine) in Blu-ray is a treat. This was either beautifully preserved or painstakingly restored or both. By daughter remarked that it looks like it was just made yesterday!The bonus on the disc is Frosty Returns, the 1992 special CBS commissioned years later (though the 1974 Rankin/Bass 'Twas the Night Before Christmas special usually held the ratings in the second half hour following Frosty), was directed by Peanuts legend Bill Melendez. CBS may have also requested that the special resemble a Peanuts special because Frosty Returns looks almost identical to a show with Charlie Brown and Snoopy.Frosty Returns is notable for several reasons, including the voice of a very young Elisabeth Moss (Peggy Olsen on MadMen) when she was a child actor, a witty script by Oliver Goldstick and Jim Lewis, and a nice supporting cast, especially if you're a SCTV and Saturday Night Live fan (the executive producer was SNL's Lorne Michaels, whose Broadway Video controlled the Rankin/Bass video library at the time).My only quibble is that Frosty Returns either never got the loving care in the vault as it animated predecessor or there was a mastering problem, because there is a lot of line noise throughout, almost as if it were a VHS tape instead of a Blu-ray! I might guess that since this show is not the main attraction, it didn't matter as much, but you can't miss the flaws when you can see the images so clearly.Other than that, Frosty the Snowman itself on Blu-ray does indeed look like it was made yesterday, rather than over 40 years ago.For more about Rankin/Bass and Frosty, check out the books and blog of author/expert Rick Goldschmidt, who helped save the peppermint mine scene.NOTE: If you have the original DVD of Frosty, you may want to hang onto to it, though, because the Blu-ray contains no extras.",4,Frosty the Blu-ray,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",0.6122

24,A3SGBLYWBCXJRW,307142469,Keith A. Mather,"[3, 4]","**SPOILER ALERT**I'll bet just about everybody has seen Frosty the Snowman at one time or another, and I can see why it's a classic. The animation may not exactly be top-notch (let's face it, Disney's animation was far much better; even in those days), but that's not really what matters. What really matters is the music, the acting, and the story behind the animation.It's the day before Christmas, and a bunch of children get together to make one big snowman. After some debating, they all agree on the name Frosty. They top their wintry creation off with an old top hat discarded by the magician Professor Hinkle, who is just about the worst magician in the world. (He can't even perform a simple card trick, or get a simple rabbit to come out of his hat.) The very second the hat touches Frosty's head, the snowman instantly comes to life. When Professor Hinkle sees that there is some magic in his hat after all, he decides he wants the hat back. The children are simply delighted to be able to talk to and play with their new friend, but when the temperature starts creeping up, Frosty realizes he must go to some place where he will never melt. And what better place to not melt than the North Pole?So, the children take Frosty downtown to the railroad station, and he and one of the children (a small girl named Karen) secretly stow away on a refrigerated box car on a train heading north. Now, a refrigerated box car really is a wonderful place to travel in--but only if one is a snowman. For Karen, who is made of human flesh, it doesn't take long at all for her to start shivering and sneezing with cold. Frosty knows that Karen can't stay in the car for much longer, so he quickly gets the both of them out the second the train comes to a rest stop.But even after they're out of the car, it still does not do Karen any good, for they are now out in the middle of the wilderness, where it is bitterly cold. Frosty realizes that he must get someone to help them out--someone who can get Karen home before she freezes to death, and him to the North Pole before he melts into a puddle. Hocus Pocus (Professor Hinkle's pet rabbit, who decides to tag along with Frosty and Karen) suggests they get Santa Claus to assist them. But Santa doesn't show up until nightfall, and aside from making sure that Karen is warm enough until Santa arrives, Frosty also has to worry about Professor Hinkle, who will stop at nothing to track the travelers down and reclaim possession of his hat.After temporarily giving Professor Hinkle the slip, Frosty and Karen manage to come across a small greenhouse, where a whole bunch of poinsettas (tropical Christmas flowers) are growing. Deciding that it must be very warm and comfortable inside the greenhouse, Frosty carries Karen inside. Karen protests that Frosty will melt if he goes into the greenhouse, and Frosty assures her that he'll only stay inside for a minute. But once they're inside, Professor Hinkle, who by then has caught up with them, shuts the door behind them and locks it. Now all the fiendish magician has to do is wait for Frosty to melt.Eventually Santa Claus shows up, and Hocus Pocus persuades him to help Frosty and Karen. While searching for the two of them, Santa and Hocus Pocus come across the greenhouse--the very same greenhouse in which Frosty and Karen are trapped. Santa quickly unlocks the door, but once he gets inside, a terrible sight meets his eyes: Karen is down on her knees, crying her eyes out, and all that's left of Frosty is an old top hat and a shapeless puddle of water on the floor. Everything looks hopeless at the moment, as you can very well imagine. Santa, however, assures Karen that all is not lost. He tells her that Frosty is not gone for good; for he is made out of Christmas snow, and Christmas snow can never disappear completely. When Karen protests that Frosty was her best friend, Santa surprises her by using his special holiday magic to restore Frosty to the way he was before.Before they can actually bring Frosty back to life with the hat, Professor Hinkle puts his foot down and demands the return of his hat then and there. Santa warns Professor Hinkle to stay away from Frosty, and to never lay so much as a finger on the brim of the hat, otherwise he'll permanently delete the magician from his list and never bring the magician another Christmas gift for the rest of his life. This insinuation hits Professor Hinkle hard, and he complains bitterly that it's not fair, for even evil magicians have to make a living. Santa then tells Professor Hinkle to go home and write I am very sorry for what I did to Frosty a hundred zillion times, and then maybe (just maybe) he'll find something in his stocking the following morning. Professor Hinkle agrees, and takes off for home as fast as he can, so that he might be able to complete the assignment before the night is over. Santa then places the hat on Frosty's head, and he immediately awakens, much to Karen's delight. Later, Santa takes Karen home, and then he takes Frosty away to the North Pole. Karen hates to say goodbye to Frosty, but Santa promises that he will bring Frosty back to the city every Christmas, and so he does. And every year from then on, Frosty's return is always celebrated with a big Christmas parade.I've watched this movie almost every Christmas for as long as I can remember, and I don't think I'll ever get tired of watching it. It's really an awesome movie, one that the whole family can enjoy. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do so.
