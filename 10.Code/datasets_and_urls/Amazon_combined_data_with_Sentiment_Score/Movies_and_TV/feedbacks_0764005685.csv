0,A30QSLHX2HC9GE,764005685,Aaron Von Raschke,"[3, 4]","PHENOMENA is also known asCREEPERS, except CREEPERS is the cut version of the film. PHENOMENA is the original, uncut version of the film directed by Horror legend Dario Argento (SUSPIRIA, MOTHER OF TEARS, etc.). It's basically about a girl named Jennifer (played by a young Jennifer Connelly) who is sent to a boarding school in Germany while her father is filming a movie in the Phillipines. While there, a bunch of murders take place involving young girls, some of whom are her schoolmates. Turns out she has the ability to communicate with insects and she utilizes her weird talent to help track down the killer, thus leading her to something truly evil and disturbing.There were two things that made me love this movie: the beautiful cinematography and the music. The cinematography in this film is gorgeous, especially for a Horror movie. Dario Argento is known for using color schemes in his films (SUSPIRIA and INFERNO are two that come to mind) and PHENOMENA is no different. A lot of whites and blues and greens are used early on in the film to create a calm, dream-like atmosphere, and then as the film draws to a conclusion, a lot of reds are used to create a nightmarish setting. The visuals in this film are just awesome. The music is also great. It's total synth-heavy 80's style music with even some Heavy Metal thrown in (Iron Maiden's Flash of the Blade is used prominently in the film as the killer's unofficial theme song). I also liked this movie for a lot of other reasons. Jennifer Connelly being one of them. I've always been a big fan of hers and it's cool to see her early on in her career in a film like this. When most people think of young Jennifer, ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA and especially LABYRINTH come to mind and this Horror film is often overlooked. Donald Pleasance stars in the film as a wheelchair-bound man who studies insects who is sort of a mentor to Jennifer.As far as the story, it's just crazy. It's a Giallo style killer movie with supernatural elements thrown in. Without spoiling anything, let me just describe the ending. Basically, it's one of the craziest endings I've ever seen in a movie. There's a homicidal deformed little boy, a straight-razor wielding chimpanzee, a giant swarm of bees, a disgusting pit of corpses and maggots, a scene similar to the ending of the firstFRIDAY THE 13THmovie (remember young Jason jumping out of the lake?), a decapitation, and numerous false endings. And that's only in the last ten or fifteen minutes!I highly recommend PHENOMENA. It's just a good, old school Horror film with a lot of good, cheesy 80's music, a lot of cool visuals, and some pretty gruesome scenes. It even has some unintentionally funny dialogue and overdubs (it's an Italian movie... they filmed it in English but they still overdubbed the voices for some reason). I'm still exploring Dario Argento's filmography, but I have yet to come across a bad one and PHENOMENA is definitely my favorite so far.4.5 stars",5,Jennifer Connelly communicates with insects to help find a maniacal killer... need I say more??,1229644800,"12 19, 2008",0.0839

2,A2UQJK29MKIPGM,764005685,Allen Bowers,"[0, 18]","I just simply cannot believe that a serious genious/meister of horror, shock, and mystery such as Dario Argento would even have the slightest gumption to stamp his name on this Air-Borne Disease! I mean what could he have been possibly thinking!! As a established big-time fan of his work and vision this movie was without a doubt the BIGGEST MISTAKE OF DARIO ARGENTO'S CAREER! When I had heard about it being the one of the few chances I would get to see his lesser-known daughter Fiore Argento, Also when I heard that Stunningly Beautiful, Ageless, and JUST PLAIN HOT!! To say noyhing of very talented Jennifer Connelly was going to be in it as well as Halloween star Donald Pleasance all starring in it plus an original concept like someone who can communicate with bugs telepathically I thought how could Dario possibly go wrong here?! Well guess what He did everything horribly wrong! First of all we only see his other daughter Fiore for like maybe the first 4 minutes of the movie,when her character misses some tour bus or something and comes by some waterfall outlook point,has no real lines, and to make matters worse gets to be the murderers first victim!(some part she had!) Well anyway I tried to shrug it off and go on. So from there we meet Jennifer Connelly's character who's name is also Jennifer(GEEZ! how creative, LOL!)And is some rich attorney's princess whom he sends to some Swiss boarding school. And to make an long story short she meets her roommate who secretly has a boyfriend and is not the nice excepting friend she believes her to be 'cause behind her back her roommate and her roommates boyfriend laugh at her! And for what it's worth I feel that this outcast who has a special secret be it a supernatural power or whatever is something that's becoming quite tiresome! Not to mention that the part of the other girls being snobs against her(in particular when they and the B***h on Wheels teacher snoop around and find out her secret via a letter intended for her father)didn't even come up until considerably later! Anyway for some reason she has this ability and isn't quite sure how to use it or control it right. Eventually she meets and befriends Donald Pleasance's character who's a wheelchair bound scientist who studies bugs. As they get to know eachother more he somehow(of course)understands her bug telepathy better than Jennifer does! WHAT?!! And he allows her not only the knowledge of how the bugs can help her find the murderer but also a fly to help her(of which for some reason he refers to as The Great Sarcophagus!) Again What?! A Sarcophagus is an Egyptian Mummy's coffin.What the HELL has that got to do with a fly! If it was a beetle that would make sense but not a fly! So the wicked boarding school teacher tries to commit her because she I guess doubts her ability to commune with bugs. Which presented the only cool scene as far as I'm concerned where she has a lot flies come to the windows and doors of the boarding house and with an angelic glimmer and the keen theme tune playing utters the words I Love You All to the flies and then faints! Needless to say after she has a completely corny easy time escaping she attempts to get a plain ticket out of Switzerland and upon failing to do so the only person at the school who was nice to her played by Argento's now ex-wife Daria Nicolodi giving Jennifer somewhere to stay at her house! I won't bore you all with too many details only that to my chagrin it wasn't bad enough Donald Pleasance's untimely death at the hands of the killer but to make matters worse get this DARIA NICOLODI's CHARACTER WAS THE KILLER THE WHOLE TIME! Not to mention Daria's character ending up being dull, bland and ONE-DIMENSIOAL! On top of that you already know she's the killer 90 minutes into the movie when there's still 15 minutes to go! Not to mention her deformed son(who quite frankly looked like a pig on acid)had some part in it!Gosh what an ugly FREAK! One bigger problem here is that that guy she left chained to the wall was neither explained nor developed as a character!I mean who was he? I also hate that Jennifer Connely's character has this control over bugs yet when Daria attempts to poison her and also when she chases after her she stupidly does not use her powers until the deformed son corners her on the motor boat! And a bigger shocker is Donald's lab monkey saving her by insanely slashing at Daria with an old fashioned razor blade which was quite disturbing! Anyway other than that I got sick and tired of looking at maggots all the time!I hate them! So in closing this movie lacked miserably in nudity,pretty colors like Dario has used in his other movies and it had a couple of annoying aforementioned plot holes! So in closing if you enjoyed Dario Argento's other movies such as the Three Mothers Trilogy(Suspiria,Inferno, and Mother of Tears)Do You Like Hitchcock? or Tenebre as much as I did then definitely skip this morbid Half-A***ed diarrhea on celluloid like the plague!",1,Phenomena wasn't terribly PHENOMENAL!

I watched this late one night thinking that I was getting something different and I was not disappointed. Argento is known for his gross out horror and he goes full out with this one. The music is heavy metal and the visuals beautiful such a combination is pretty interesting especially once the killing begins.The extras on this are very informative and just as off the wall as the movie.

I'm a big horror fan, I like &quot;weird and offbeat horror&quot;, and have enjoyed other Italian horror films by such directors as Mario Bava. Based on the great reviews of this movie on this site, I decided to pick this one up and was I ever disappointed. It's not scary and you'll see more gore in a Friday the 13th or Freddy Kreuger movie. The plot is so incoherent that the film becomes absolutely tiresome to watch. The only good things about it are seeing Jennifer Connelly run around in her nightgown, and the heavy metal soundtrack (which actually sounds very misplaced in parts of the film). The best part of the DVD is listening to the commentary by the filmmakers, who actually seem to think they've made some great piece of art with this film, when it's really just high-budget amateur hour. The only reason to watch this film is if you want to see a slightly weird, bad horror movie.

6,A2UKC6QFG9L5GV,764005685,Anton Ilinski,"[1, 1]","Phenomena is my personal favourite Argento film. It has practically all the elements that form other movies of Italian maestro: boarding school for girls, mysterious murderer, dreamy atmosphere, beautiful music (although I thought the soundtrack could do easily without Iron Maiden and Motorhead), hidden rooms and passages in the houses, some unexpected and unthinkable plot lines, like Jennifer Connely's character being able to communicate with insects...It's difficult, maybe even impossible to explain the beauty of Argento's pictures. I think whether you see it or not. It's like whether you love fantasy genre or not. Phenomena is extremely picturesque, enchanting and dark if you get into Argento's work. If you don't I guess you wouldn't be reading this. So if you enjoyed his other films like Opera, Inferno or Suspiria you'll get a lot of pleasure watching this one.Now a few words about editions: there are about 15 different releases of different countries, and Anchor Bay one is rather good - it has commentaries and some extra features. But my pick is German 2-disc limited edition by Dragon entertainment. It has loads of extras and some additional dialog sequences missing in AB release. This edition is rather hard to find nowdays.

11,AMYWL00JMEZXA,764005685,bugman,"[1, 2]","ever since i can remember, i have loved animals, with a special extra level of adoration existing for insects, arachnids, and other arthropods. so, when i read about dario argento&#8217;s new movie &#8220;creepers&#8221; in fangoria (issue #49 to be exact) back around 1985, i was quite excited. then, whatever summer that followed, in a video store in birmingham, alabama, i convinced my friend that we should rent it, we did, and we were on our way.from the very beginning, &#8220;creepers&#8221; pulls you in, with its' gorgeous, lush photography, revealing wind-blown trees and grass moving like water. when bill wyman and terry taylor&#8217;s haunting &#8220;valley&#8221; begins, we know we&#8217;re in for a creepy, beautiful, totally crazy ride. the story of a young girl consigned to a boarding school right out of a roald dahl story, who befriends a scientist and a chimpanzee en route to discovering her latent telepathy with insects and uncovering the trail of a mutant, serial-killer cannibal, is just a delight that permanently engraved itself in my brain...AND in my heart, as well.my friend and i enjoyed the crazy, 82 minute film, which exposed our young brains to something that was both sophisticated in its' visual set-up, and dark and disturbing on its&#8217; insides. &#8220;creepers&#8221; really appealed to me, most especially because jennifer connelly didn&#8217;t just tell insects what to do, but she communicated with them. this meant a lot to me, because insects are rarely regarded as individuals with their own interests and proclivities. but still, the movie seemed incomplete. there were scenes that seemed to end abruptly, or have gaps in dialogue. the movie seemed impatient and impulsive. beautiful, but uneven.imagine my joy when i discovered the full cut, two hours, almost 40 more minutes than &#8220;creepers.&#8221; even the title, &#8220;phenomena,&#8221; made much more sense to me; despite being a movie of great intensity and disturbing sequences, it is also a fairy tale, beautiful and heartfelt, filled with magic and mystery. &#8220;creepers&#8221; was clearly an effort to play up the more exploitative elements of the movie, while &#8220;phenomena&#8221; is a complete film, both horrible, and dramatic, like a good fairy tale ought to be. i realized what a different ball park we were in when jennifer first gets to the school. in &#8220;creepers,&#8221; she and sophie talk for like thirty seconds. in &#8220;phenomena,&#8221; they have a full conversation, sharing aspects of their lives and developing a friendship. &#8220;phenomena&#8221; also gives us more of donald pleasance&#8217;s wonderful entomologist john mcgregor. it&#8217;s this forensic entomological aspect that makes &#8220;phenomena&#8221; extra cool. it&#8217;s such a perfect, crazy movie.there is much debate, it seems, about the soundtrack. some seem to find it jarring, unnecessary, and generally out of place. personally, i think it's perfect. the claudio simmonetti operatic tune is just gorgeous. songs by iron maiden, motorhead, and the andi sex gang contribute to the movies tempo and atmosphere, and they modernize a movie that is otherwise set in the rustic alps or whatever. and, of course, let us not forget about sturdy, gorgeous goblin.jennifer connelly is excellent, being at once youthful, and also very determined. her alliance with mcgregor and his chimp, inga, played excellently by tanga, gives the movie a nice sense of community. these three are able to find one another--and support one another--when the community jennifer belongs to at the boarding school, is combative and unbelieving. when watching this movie, pay close attention to inga in each scene; she is hysterical, and very engaged in what is going on.funky, weird, beautiful, passionate, personal, and totally nuts, &#8220;phenomena&#8221; is one of my favorite movies, and a pure, nightmarish delight to watch every time. i&#8217;d love to read a thorough retrospective (or a book) about this sublime film, far and away my favorite argento. i&#8217;d be especially curious to hear jennifer connelly&#8217;s recollections of making this movie, as well as her thoughts on it today, especially as an oscar-winning, &#8220;major&#8221; actress.i think the beauty of this movie is summed up nicely when, after being abused and taunted by her schoolmates, jennifer has an episode that draws a zillion flies to the windows of the school as her classmates start to freak out and think that maybe this gal can talk to insects, and she looks at them and says &#8220;i love you. i love you all,&#8221; and then faints to the ground. perfect.",5,"argento's personal, magical horror: insects, apes, total insanity",1382918400,"10 28, 2013",0.4645

I will say that I don't mind the heavy metal soundtrack at all. Nothing wrong with Goblin, but I also like Iron Maiden. If you like Bruce Dickinson/Iron Maiden, you'll do fine. Ignore the complaints about the soundtrack. I just wish the high-end wasn't rolled-off on the English soundtrack. It sounds clearer on the Italian soundtrack.I am comparing this with the first Anchor Bay release being sold for $39 on here now (Egads!) The video quality on this Blu-Ray is much improved over the old non-anamorphic Anchor Bay version. HOWEVER, the Blu-Ray dropped the 5.1 surround sound, and we are only left with stereo. More importantly, the Blu-Ray also dropped the commentary track!! This was a major disappointment for me, and means that now I must hold onto my DVD (which is apparently getting rare now, anyway). It also drops the 3 music videos, which I didn't care that much about but were nice to have. IT ALSO drops the Dario Argento interview on the Joe Franklin show! Even if that interview wasn't anything spectacular, it's still Dario Argento being interviewed on an American television show, and therefore a piece of history worth keeping. Most Americans still don't know who Dario Argento is. There's so much room on Blu-Ray I'm sure they could have fit compressed versions of the other extras on this.The 5 stars is for the movie itself, and for being able to watch a young Jennifer Connelly in a movie that most people who aren't fans of the genre will never even have heard of.

PHENOMENA lacks much of the stylistic flare that can be found in the director's earlier efforts, save for a few beautifully-shot yet brutally violent death sequences. Although it cannot technically be classified as a Giallo, many of the traits do resemble this Italian form of suspense thriller. Jennifer Connelly plays our young heroine in one of her earliest starring roles. She is convincing enough as Jennifer, but not nearly as enthralling as she could have been in the lead. Donald Pleasance also appears in a small but vital role as entomologist John McGregor, who provides several key pieces to the puzzle. PHENOMENA's greatest misstep is in its arbitrary ending, which really has no bearing on the events that preceded and hardly answers any of the motivations behind the first several murders. This detracts from an otherwise engaging and suspenseful murder mystery. PHENOMENA does provide a fair share of revolting gross-outs and shocking deaths, and while it may not be the best representation of Argento's work, it has certainly earned its place as a fan favorite for many Italian film buffs.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",4,Phenomena,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",0.0096
14,AUDIJM3VUULS7,764005685,Charles Tatum,"[0, 0]","I want to start this review with a personal story. When I was in elementary school, I saw Looking for Mr. Goodbar starring Diane Keaton. Keaton was naked, I was in love. I was a movie buff, even back then, so I decided to write my own movie. It was called Looking for Mr. Goodbar 2, in which Keaton's character survived her stabbing, and kept sleeping with other men. This dramatic milestone ran eight pages, in screenplay form, and I was very proud of my sophisticated use of the F word throughout. Then I showed it to my dad...I did not try another screenplay until I was in college, and it still sucked.Why the story? First, this will serve as proof that I thought up the idea for Goodbar 2 if Hollywood tries it (anything's possible, just look at Species II). This also draws an analogy to the script for Creepers. Creepers is one of the most juvenile-written movies of our time.Argento is such a good director, there are scary scenes here, scenes you have never seen before. Connelly is gorgeous, but a little stiff as an American girl who is sent to a boarding school in Switzerland, and becomes involved in solving a series of murders. Pleasence is wasted, as he always is, as a bug doctor who befriends Connelly.There are two different good film ideas in the script. One is A crippled bug doctor and a young student solve some horrific murders at a Swiss boarding school. The second is A young student gets through her lack of friends by finding out she can communicate with bugs. Blending the two ideas is a serious flaw. There are parts of this that scared me to death, and parts where I yelled oh, Dario! because what he was giving me as a viewer was so poorly thought out.I realize I saw the butchered 82 minute version of the film but there are plot points in here that are so beyond the reach of belief, they must be seen to be believed.Creepers is creepy, and I recommend it, but with severe conditions.The 82 minute version is rated (R) for physical violence, strong gore, and profanity.",3,Dario Argento's Creepers,1023148800,"06 4, 2002",0.0067

Things aren't all well, as eight months ago, a schoolgirl's head was found, and others have vanished since.Jennifer's not your ordinary girl. For one thing, she has a great rapport with insects. She loves them and they feel comfortable around her. A retired instructor and entomologist, Dr. John McGregor, who befriends her, tells her that it's normal for insects to be slightly telepathic--hence their attraction to her. But is it normal for her, she asks? In one instance, her presence calms the insects in his lab. She's also a somnabulist in times of stress and change. In fact it is one of these nighttime walks that leads her to the doctor.Her roommate Sophie then vanishes, and with the help of a firefly, finds a glove that might have been worn by the killer. McGregor, convinced that the killer might have kept remains of his victim where he lives, encourages Jennifer to seek him out with the help of the Great Sarcophagus, a fly that can find a corpse from long distances. You're in a position to do extraordinary things. he tells her, listing her and the fly as the two greatst detective ever known. That fly is your magic wand.There are some revisits to old themes: e.g. schoolgirls being murdered (Suspiria), strict headmistresses (Suspiria) decapitations (Deep Red), underwater sequences (Inferno), and attack by animal hordes (again Inferno). The best effect involves hoardes of flies surrounding one side of the school, coming when Jennifer's in distress. In a behind the scenes documentary after the movie, special visual effects man Luigi Cozzi explains how they did that shot.There are two music videos using footage both used and not used in the movie. They are of Goblin's Claudio Simonetti, which features an operatic female voice and a racing techno number. Another is Bill Wyman, (yes, THAT Bill Wyman) and his stark instrumental number Valley which uses scenes of Jennifer in the mysterious house and the Danish tourist who is killed. Finally, there's an interview with Argento on the Joe Franklin Show, where despite being touted as someone who out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock, makes the point that his styles are different, which they are.Daria Niccolodi (Miss Bruchner) doesn't have much screen time and isn't as appealing or sympathetic as she was in her previous Argento movies. Donald Pleasance is the only other appealing character here as McGregor.This movie does have Argento's usual hallmarks of psychological horror, gory deaths and blood, but it pales when compared to Suspiria or Inferno. Jennifer Connelly, appealing in her early teen years, carries this film, playing Jennifer Corvino as shy, dedicated, lucid, and headstrong.",4,Good but not phenomenal Argento,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",0.0606

21,A1TOH8S8I1VT9R,764005685,E K Maxmias Frighteningly Real,"[9, 12]","This was my second dip into the Argento pool. I had recently watched Tenebre, one of Argento's best from what I can gather. I was worried about a let down because I enjoyed that film so much. So I prepared myself. I read some reviews and took some advice. The results of my preparation were a mixed bag; some good, some bad. So, I appropriately lowered my expectations but hoped for the best. What I learned about Argento from watching Phenomena was that perhaps his biggest weakness is his clumsy story telling. Let me get to the point, hopefully quicker than Phenomena.-IF YOU WANT TO BE IMPORTANT, YOU HAVE TO LOOK IMPORTANT.Argento has a knack for making everything look so important that you are glued to the imagery on the screen. Phenomena is full of long, stylish, detailed, seemingly important scenes. Every scene has a sort of leisurely pace to it. I began to assume that if I didn't pay attention, I would miss something. Eventually, this became a chore. After about 70 minutes, there had been 4 fairly unremarkable murders and yet we were no closer to knowing who the killer was. When it was finally over, I scratched my head and thought, Did I miss something? So I watched it all again. It turned out that I hadn't missed a thing. Most of the movie was not nearly as important to the plot as its treatment would have you believe. The result was an overly arduous, not particularly meaningful journey for a brief and crazy end.-SO, WHICH STORY DID YOU LIKE?Even though most of the movie was treated with overwrought and unwarranted importance, nothing that happened could be declared useless. But there were so many things that were given importance I wondered which thread of the story was the one that mattered most. How important was the generous time spent on the entomologist's theories? What role would the girl's talent with insects play? Why is the school so important? Does the hot but nasty teacher hold any significance? Was that time spent at the bank warranted? It turned out that all of the unique threads had very convoluted and somewhat ludicrous connection to how the film ended. I was forced to invest effort into all of the deceptive threads resulting in disappointment at their ultimate lack of importance. The worst part about it was that most of it wasn't particularly exciting or interesting.-AT LEAST THE T-SHIRT IS OK. (Content could be interpreted as spoilers)So I went through all this effort on stuff that varied in importance because I couldn't be sure what really mattered. My reward for all of this was an ending that bordered on cheating. It turns out the murders were committed by someone we never met directly or were never given cause to suspect until they are revealed. You could not possibly have deduced who it was because no meaningful clues were ever presented. Luckily, the ending has enough wacked-out moments and lively pacing that at least some satisfaction is achieved. However, that's only when compared to the rest of the films slogging pace.-JUST BE YOURSELF JENNIFER.Jennifer Connelly and Donald Pleasance are the big attraction here. Jennifer is very good at acting like Jennifer; a female Harrison Ford. Donald scrapped his usually wonderful British accent for a nearly undecipherable Scottish accent. There were other actors I won't mention though they were all capable for the most part. The chimp (Yes, the chimp) was actually an interesting figure whose function is clumsily jammed into place.-SHE'S BRUSHING HER TEETH; CUE MOTORHEAD.The music was wildly varied in style from scene to scene and just as wildly inappropriate in its placement. We often get scenes of someone walking slowly with some crazy guitar rock grinding away in the background. I can't say this had a big impact on me because I had bigger problems than the music to worry about. It didn't help though.-SAY IT ISN'T SO!!Some might be disappointed that there is no nudity and limited gore in this film. I don't mind those things but it wasn't a major sticking point with me in Phenomena. I will say that a little more gore and nudity might have distracted me from the sluggish pace of the story. Yet, I think it would have had limited affect. Of course, the frenzied ending, which could be considered gratuitous, goes a long way to keep this from being a total loss.-VENUS FLYTRAP.As I stated before, Argento has a talent for giving drama to the most mundane event. Up to now, I really do like the overall feel of his films. They have a very inviting visual style. However, the enticing visuals could not enhance the plodding story enough to keep me interested or entertained throughout. He almost fooled me into believing that what I was seeing was always important.-THE FLY ON THE WALL.The fly on the wall knows the truth. In all honestly, I didn't like the way this story was played out. It was almost as if Argento had an ending in mind and then back-loaded the story to provide him all the pieces to construct his grand finale. The grand finale was pretty compelling but the back-loaded story was clumsy and those pieces didn't always fit too well. Why Jennifer's talent with bugs is important, why the chimp matters, why we spend so much time at school or in the bank and everything else was not nearly as important as the attention it was given. No matter how visually compelling things were, the events taking place just weren't that big a deal most of the time. Though Argento's talent is evident, the decent acting and visual aspects of this film were not enough to fix the convoluted story.Story.....2 starsActing...3.5 starsVisuals...4 starsMusic....2.5 starsAverage..3 stars",3,I Climbed the Alps and All I Got Was This Stupid T-Shirt.,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",0.0906

25,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,764005685,General Zombie,"[7, 8]","Simply put, this film is pretty messed up. I don't know quite how seriously we are supposed to take all this, as the various plot elements and twists are just so bizarre and/or silly. Part of me would like to believe that this is supposed to be a whole lot more light-hearted than Argento's other fare, but I don't really believe this is the case. (I certainly could be wrong, though) So, in the end, I suspect this was just a severe misstep on Argento's part, but it's an entertaining misstep, at least.This film combines Giallo with supernatural elements, to odd effect. The basic setup is that a 14 or so year old American girl, Jennifer Corvino, is sent off to a fancy private girls-school in Switzerland, whereabouts a maniac killer is slaughtering young girls. Also, Jennifer sleepwalks, and has a telepathic connection with insects.(!) Naturally, she and Scottish entomoloigist, Dr. Somethingorother, who just happens to be in the area, determine that they must catch the killer, with the help of the insects.(!) This may sound a bit more complicated than most of Argento's other fare, and it is, which leads to the main problem with the film- too much plot, not enough killing. The acting is something of a mixed-bag, as it tends to be in Argento's films. Donald Pleasance, as the entomologist, gives the best performance in the film. He's likable, and quite restrained by his standards. Sadly, he has a smaller part than I'd imagined. A very young Jennifer Connelly (Dark City, A Beautiful Mind) plays the lead, and suffice to say she is a much better actress now than she was then. She's not terrible, but pretty flat and bored much of the time. (It's interesting to note that she was 14 at the time, approximately the same age as the character she was playing. What a novel concept) Daria Nicolodi, who generally gives some of the best performances in Argento's movies, is a bit off here. Sometimes she's good, sometimes she overdoes it. Most of the other roles in the film are pretty tiny, but the supporting actors are quite consistently bad. Some of Jennifer's schoolmates are almost painful to watch, but they aren't around much. The chimp who plays the wheelchair bound entomologist helper-chimp does a decent job too, and Argento wisely does not give him too much screen time, as all monkey are hideous and obnoxious. (Though he is less hideous and obnoxious than most)The plot is pretty off the wall, but that's not the real problem with the film. The real concern is that the horror scenes just aren't any where near Argento's standards. Most of them are staged in a not particularly interesting fashion, and lack any terribly interesting gore. (There is some gross out stuff, but most of it isn't in the death scenes. I'll get to that later) Furthermore, the killer generally uses a very modern, metallic spear, which just isn't a very interesting weapon. Still, it has it's moments. The most effective death is towards the beginning, where a nameless girl is being chased by the killer, and stabbed in the back with the spear.(Spoilers) She then crashes part way through a window and screams at a Jennifer, only to have the spear driven through the back of her head and out her mouth. Sadly, that's the only killing toward the beginning of the film which is particularly interesting. (The ending is better)Stylistically, this is a bit more restrained than most of Argento's other films from that era. Still, it looks nice, with lots of beautiful forested scenery, and some cool architecture and a bit of ominous, stylized lighting in some scenes. The camerawork and cinematography aren't terribly exciting however, other than a nice shot of the camera zooming through a house to find a maggot-covered severed hand. The music is hit and miss. As is typical of Argento's soundtracks, and soundtracks involving Goblin, the music itself is well written, although the production techniques tend to be a bit dated. I particularly like one of the more prominent themes, until it breaks out into an inappropriate and overdone dancebeat. (I'm talking about the one with the solo opera singer) Still, it's not as good as what you usually get in an Argento film. They also use some heavy metal here, and it doesn't work very well. (Unlike in Opera, where I actually think it does) The problem is that it isn't used at appropriate times: It's ok to use it after the killing is already underway, but not during moments where you're trying to build tension. That, and it uses a popular, well-known song (Flash of the Blade) which is a bit distracting in and of itself. (i.e. I think it better to use more obscure stuff, so that it doesn't call too much attention to itself)It may seem like I've done nothing but criticize this movie, but in the end it's quite fun and entertaining. The plot is quite absurd, but more interesting than most of his other films, and it's got a very entertaining climax, with a bunch of deliriously weird twists. They also kick up the gross out quotient towards the end, with a nasty pit of rotting corpses, a hideous mutant child, a hilariously dated decapitation, self-mutilation in order to escape a pair of handcuffs, and worst of all, some painfully drawn out vomiting. And the final twist, while clearly telegraphed, is pretty amusing as well.In the end, this is a `good-bad' movie. (unlike the 5 other Argento films I've seen, which were good-good movies) But that's better than most movie can manages, and this is certainly worth seeing if you're interested in the director's work in general.",3,"Very wacky, but entertaining",1097366400,"10 10, 2004",0.0281

31,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,764005685,Jeffrey Leach,"[0, 1]","After watching Dario Argento's 1985 film Phenomena, I have finally started to make serious inroads into his substantial body of work. It was easy to claim ignorance of many of this Italian director's films up until a few years ago because it was difficult to find them anywhere, let alone in an uncut form. Fortunately, DVD arrived on the scene and eager film fans with dollars to spend inspired numerous companies to start churning out any movie they could get their hands on. Even Troma, the flagship of flaccid filmmaking, released a version of Argento's The Stendhal Syndrome. It wasn't too long before practically every Argento film arrived on store shelves, many of them in uncut, unrated formats. Unfortunately, most viewers have likely never heard of Dario Argento. These days, more people know the director's beautiful daughter Asia than the horror maestro himself. What a shame. Argento's films, at least the ones I have seen, are masterpieces of style injected with truly cringe inducing violence. For a few years in the 1980s and 1990s, Argento drifted away from his tried and true giallo formula, only recently returning to some semblance of form with Stendhal and Sleepless. Phenomena has a few giallo elements, but overall it is definitely different from his early thrillers.Jennifer Connelly (Dark City, Requiem for a Dream) plays Jennifer Corvino, the teenaged daughter of a movie star sent to an exclusive Swiss boarding school for girls. She never fits in despite her distinguished pedigree largely due to a strangeness about her that the other students immediately pick up on. Her only friend at the school is her French roommate, and her only pal outside of school is Professor John McGregor (Donald Pleasence), a bug researcher working on a spate of particularly grisly murders. Corvino lives at the school for only a short time before strange things start happening. First, she starts sleepwalking, a habit not unfamiliar to her but one that causes quite a bit of consternation amongst her classmates and teachers. Moreover, when she suffers one of her nocturnal adventures, she mentally connects to the same killer McGregor is investigating. Second, and an even eerier occurrence, is Corvino's burgeoning ability to communicate and control insects through psychic manipulation. Soon, Jennifer embarks on a mission to track down the murderer, a task made more personal when her roommate dies under the killer's knife.Corvino's situation is a treacherous one, fraught with perils for her and everyone she knows. McGregor soon falls prey to the killer, effectively leaving Jennifer alone in a hostile world. As the young heroine desperately attempts to contact her father's lawyer by phone to get her out of this mess, she moves closer and closer to identifying the warped soul (souls, perhaps?) behind the heinous crimes. Since Phenomena comes from the mind of Dario Argento, it almost goes without saying that twists and turns abound as the conclusion draws near. Furthermore, the movie contains many scenes of Argento's trademark violence, the truly cringe inducing brutality that turns the stomachs of even the most jaded gorehounds. Phenomena may not be Dario's most graphically violent film, or even his most intricate in terms of suspense or plot, but it is deeply disturbing. It is also magnificently photographed in the director's trademark style. The movie manages to achieve cloying claustrophobia (the shots in the house and the tunnels) balanced with expansive views of the Swiss countryside and the grounds of the school.I am a sucker for any film with Donald Pleasence on the cast list, so praising his performance here is pure overkill on my part. I will say the McGregor character gives Pleasence one of his more restrained horror film roles, a role he pulls off perfectly. Jennifer Connelly, on the other hand, outright wows in her role as the beleaguered Jennifer Corvino. The actress was only fourteen years old when she played the part, but is so stunningly beautiful you can barely look at her directly. She carries off the Corvino character perfectly, capturing the poise and attitude of a famous actor's daughter who has been there and done that to a T. I had to check Connelly's age several times just to make sure she wasn't older than fourteen; she often comes off as someone in their early twenties, at least. How can someone this young look so comfortable in front of the camera? If I had never seen Connelly in another role than this one, I would assume her success in Hollywood was assured based on this part alone. Argento knows how to get good performances out of his actors; he even knows how to work with animals, as one of the main characters in Phenomena is McGregor's razor wielding pet chimpanzee.DVD companies generally recognize Dario Argento films have many fans, so even the sparsest disc usually has a few extras. Phenomena has a lot, including a commentary from Dario, an interview with the director on the Joe Franklen show, trailers, behind the scenes stuff, two music videos, and biographies and filmographies. The movie is a winner although there were a few things about it I didn't like. I didn't care for the odd mix of heavy metal music (from bands like Iron Maiden and Motorhead) and eerie synthesizer tracks from Claudio Simonetti of Goblin fame. I don't have anything against Iron Maiden, not at all, but I thought their inclusion here took something away from the film. I also would have liked more stylish giallo elements. Still, Phenomena should find its way onto any horror fan's list, and its required viewing for fans of Argento.",4,Argento does it again,1082160000,"04 17, 2004",0.0483

36,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,764005685,John's Horror Corner,"[0, 0]","Bizarre and haphazard, Argento's clumsy storytelling advances at a painfully slow pace until the brief, bonkers and satisfying finale. Largely not worth a watch.Director Dario Argento (Mother of Tears, Suspiria) is considered a master of horror. I've read reviews suggesting that this is &#34;Argento's neglected masterpiece&#34; and &#34;one of Argento's best.&#34; Sorry to be a naysayer, but a masterpiece this is not.Jennifer (Jennifer Connelly; Labyrinth, Dark Water), not your typical protagonist, is a sleepwalking psychic with an affinity for insects. Argento's (at best) clumsy storytelling follows his typical trends. Young women are being murdered and a heroine is guided by erratic, choppy, trance-like dream sequences to solve the mystery. When Jennifer befriends an entomology professor with a pet chimp, that seemed to push it all over the edge of absurdity for me.Our 14-year old heroine teams up with the professor to solve a string of murders taking place at a private school in Switzerland. Making him perhaps one of the worst academics ever, the professor seems to have no difficulty finding instant credibility in Jennifer's telepathic connection to insects.Now I called Argento's storytelling &#34;clumsy&#34; at best, and I realize this may upset some people. But watch this movie and I challenge you to find any plot significance in any of the scenes&#8230;any of them. The film wears on, murders accumulate, and we find ourselves no closer to knowing who or what the killer is or the motive behind the killing. Not only does this story fail to lead us anywhere, but there are no attempts at clues, linking events or red herrings to keep us guessing. The only thing I found myself guessing was why the Hell was this movie even made if Argento had nothing to say? Aimless story or not, Argento sees fit to lead his actors into a strong fog of melodrama to make viewers believe that these vapid scenes actually yield some significance.That said, whereas Argento is no storyteller, he has a strong grasp of instilling urgency as he makes almost every scene intense (even if unnecessarily so), using wildly inappropriate rock music to score up tension in otherwise mundane scenes. It was as if someone calmly walking down a corridor merited a hair metal guitar solo. The dream sequences feel drug-induced and keep our eyes locked on the screen so as not to miss a thing and the actors' melodrama certainly keeps our attention as we wonder how they may be linked to the murders.Argento's strong suit is gore, which is most highlighted by the scenes with the deformed child and when Jennifer falls into a pit of festering human offal reminiscent of the pool scene in Poltergeist (1982) and the grave-digging scene in Drag Me to Hell (2009). And despite the story's outcome which couldn't possibly have been deduced, the final act was full of bonkers murderous action which left me very entertained. The closing scene answers the questions why did the professor have a pet chimp? and is Jennifer's insect telepathy actually important in this movie? However, the answers are far from intelligent or reasonable, doing little more than offering weirdly shocking moments in the finale.I'd recommend that less seasoned horror fans skip this film until they find the insatiable desire to see everything (much as I do).",2,"Bizarre and haphazard, Argento's clumsy storytelling advances at a painfully slow pace until the bonkers finale.",1382227200,"10 20, 2013",-0.0301

38,A2YQ5O6XV23543,764005685,Kevin H. Dudley,"[5, 6]","I'm a big Dario Argento fan particularly of his output starting with Bird with a Crystal Plumage up through the ferocious 1987 film Opera. While his films after Opera in my eyes saw a increasingly depressing drop in quality that unfortunately continues to this day, those films from BWTCP up through and including Opera are all great films that are just stunning to watch purely from a craft & filmmaking standpoint. Phenomena was released in 1985 to lukewarm reviews as the film was just so out there from a purely stylistic standpoint that many people didn't quite know to make of it. It also didn't help that in America almost an entire half hour was cut out of the film for its release under the alternate title Creepers. You had a 13 year old Jennifer Connelly who could communicate with insects, Donald Pleasance with a pet monkey that was also his helper and a dwarf killer running around murdering young girls at an all girl school in Switzerland where the film is set to name a few of the delightful oddities that make this film so much fun. I can't neglect to mention the heavy metal soundtrack that plays along with most of the murder scenes too. The film is also puncuated with his trademark over-the-top graphic violence throughout. While I don't think it's Dario's best film, it is my personal favorite movie of his that I come back to the most.Prior to this blu ray release, Anchor Bay had released the 110 minute Europeran cut of the film first in non-anamorphic widescreen DVD and then with a new anamorphic transfer that also preserved the film's original 1.66:1 theatrical aspect ratio. What some people didn't realize at the time was that there was still a longer Italian cut that was close to 116 minutes in length. For the film's blu ray release, Arrow Video decided to release the full 116 minute Italian cut. Since English dialogue hadn't been recorded for these additional scenes, the film occasionally switches back to the Italian language track with English subtitles similar to what Anchor Bay had to do with their DVD/blu-ray of Dario's classic film Deep Red. It's not nearly as as jarring as it sounds.A lot of people have taken Arrow Video to task for their transfers used on their blu-rays of Argento's amazing 1982 film Tenebrae and some of Lucio Fulci's great horror titles. There was also complaints about the transfer of Phenomena too. I find all of these complaints hogwash for the most part because even with the blu-ray's imperfections visually, it still blows the old DVD's away without even trying.The complaint about Phenomena is that digital noise reduction was used to erase some of the film grain which gives the film a cleaner look than people would like. The DNR isn't overdone though and the cast never begin to have any waxy looks like when DNR is used egregiously like the ultimate hunter edition of Predator or Fox's initial blu-ray of Patton. Would I preferred for all of the film grain to have been left in, most certainly. But there is still a ton of detail that is a massive leap both over the older DVD's and the colors really pop in a way that it's truly like seeing the film again for the first time. The difference between this blu ray and the older Anchor Bay DVD is truly like night and day.The sound is presented in two channel stereo which sounds fine. Cool extras include a 52 minute making of featurette, a little over 6 minute discsussion on the original music by Cladio Simonetti and an almost 19 minute Q&A; with Sergio Stivaletti discussing the film's creature and gore effects. None of the extras from the Anchor Bay DVD have been carried over including the commentary track so completists will want to hang onto that old DVD.The blu-ray is region free NTSC format including all of the extras so it plays perfectly in all US blu ray players. This is well worth picking up for fans of this criminally underrated film and a great upgrade that all fans should enjoy greatly.",5,This review pertains to the Arrow Video blu-ray.,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",0.2208

This is the original 110-minute version of the 1985 film that was eventually edited down to the 82-minute edited version known in the U.S. asCreepers. I will have to check that out some time because less might actually be more in the case of this particular film. I say that because I was ready to give up on this movie because halfway through the DVD kept coming to a stop. I kept taking it out, cleaning it and blowing into the player, over and over again in an attending to get the offending dust mote or whatever. Just before I decided to send the DVD back because I had no compelling reason to watch the rest of the film, I tried it on a different DVD player and found out that this horror film has an ending that you have to see in order to believe.Phenomena begins with a young girl (the director's daughter Fiore) getting off of a bus somewhere in the Swiss Alps and getting killed. Fans of Argento knows he likes heads to break glass when people are getting killed and that happens for the first of two times in this film. Eight months later Inspector Geiger (Patrick Bauchau) is still working the case, one of a string of murders, and consulting with Professor John McGregor (Donald Pleasance), a wheelchair-bound insect specialist who knows all about what insects do to human corpses. Then we meet 13-year-old Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly in her first lead role), who has been sent by her parents to a private girls academy. Having an American movie star for a parent cuts no slack with the other girls, who ridicule Jennifer for being a sleepwalker who likes bugs. The headmistress of the school denounces Jennifer as a Lady of the Flies while the local doctor is worried that Jennifer's sleepwalking is the first step towards developing a split personality (really, this is their diagnosis). When the girls torment Jennifer she calls all of the insects around the school to her aid and you are thinking that what Argento is doing here is a variation of Carrie, where the tormented girl with the strange powers turns the table of her tormenters. But there is still that unknown killer running around and Argento has no intention of taking full advantage of this strange little power.After getting the necessary explanations and exposition from Prof. McGregor, Jennifer actually uses one of her insect friends to find the spot along the bus route where the first girl was killed, which is rather original. This is where the DVD I was watching started giving me headaches and I was ready to just give up on the film, because the only part that had really caught my attention was the chimpanzee that keeps Prof. McGregor company and who was stealing the movie from the human cast. But I am certainly glad I watched the rest of Phenomena because that chimp has two of the better scenes in the entire movie and Argento pulls out all of the stops for the big finish. The endgame of this film really erupts given how relatively tame the rest of the film has been up to this point. There is a little bit of everything here in the effort to totally turn your stomach (I have to wonder if the makers of Saw III happened to catch this movie because of what Inspector Gieger does).The result is not even close to being a great film because the weaving together of the science fiction and horror elements is quite uneven, but then there comes a scene like the one where the chimp goes after a Japanese carp kite stuck in a tree on a moonlight night and suddenly I am really pay attention. By the time Jennifer is following that phone cord the gloves are off. I do not know if this is the one Dario Argento film you should see if you only see one of his macabre little films, but at the very least the last act of this film will definitely give you something to talk about. I decided to round up on Phenomena, but it could well be that whoever edited it down to Creepers helped the slow first half of this film so it could well be that the butchered American version ends up being a solid four. If and when I check it out I will remember to come back here and render a verdict on that score.",4,Force yourself to sit through the slow stuff to get to Argento's endgame,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",-0.0902

Whereas the edited version was a fast-moving collage of half-baked themes which evoked nothing of any significance, PHENOMENA reinstates the crazy-quilt pacing, whereby dream-like passages surrender abruptly to episodes of screaming hysteria, all of which is essential to any appreciation of the film's dark ambitions.Romano Albani's sumptuous cinematography transforms the breathtaking Swiss locations into a fairy-tale landscape where monstrous eruptions of violence disturb the illusion of tranquility, and Jennifer Connelly drifts through the narrative in a state of near-hypnotic grace, allowing herself to become ensnared by the machinations of a deformed killer and his/her equally psychotic 'guardian'. True, the longer version is bogged down at times by lengthy dialogue scenes which hold up the plot, and the involvement of Donald Pleasence's chimp is no less misguided than before (its final act of retribution crosses the line into absurdity), but the set-pieces are magnificently realised, and the final 20 minutes are as hair-raising as anything in Argento's ouevre.",4,Argento's neglected masterpiece,948499200,"01 22, 2000",-0.1289

His style should be known by now and again his use of camera shots and colours are quite effective in this film. A daughter of a popular movie star is the protagonist in this film as she can see visions and control insects to solve, yet again, like David Hemmings in Deep Red, a series of brutal killings in Switzerland. Donald Pleasance adds the contemporary English prescence as does Jessica Connelly as the American student plagued with sleep walking disorders and out of control telekinetic powers, hence that this movie was directed at American audiences. Again, Dario Argento presents to us a situation out of control and tries to show how those who are involved in them try to cope with them. In this case &lt;I cannot reveal all&gt; a murderer is loose trying to cover up the crimes of a supposed pyschopath. Only Dario Argento can use lighting and wind effects to show a mood and he does this so well while conveying a story. This is a very moody film, a bit dark in places, but again that sets the tone for the mind of the killer. Jessica uses her telekinesis to full effect to find a brutal murderer and succeeds in spades, up to and almost including her own life. The characters are a bit woody in places, as they really are just props in this film, but the overall affect is pure horror and a showcase for more grisly death scenes. The ending of this is really a shocker and for those who do not know this, Jessica Connelly REALLY DID swim in a pool of live maggots in this film.

Well, the result would be &quot;Phenomena,&quot; a dull-as-a-rusty-razor inductee in Argento's 'Three Blunders' trilogy (&quot;Inferno&quot; and &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; are the others).The movie, which has aspects that are pretty interchangeable with Argento's previous (and better) shocker, &quot;Suspiria,&quot; revolves around Jennifer Corvino (Jennifer Connelly, in the Jessica Harper role), the daughter of a movie star who is sent to a foreboding Swiss boarding school. Oh, and did I mention there's a killer lurking in the shadows? Jennifer quickly bonds with her roommate, but isn't accepted by the other girls, perhaps because she has the uncanny ability to communicate with the insect world (no, I'm being serious here). She's befriended by an entomologist (Donald Pleasence) with a pet monkey, and is ultimately drafted to uncover the murderer with the help of her creepy-crawly buddies.When I purchased &quot;Phenomena,&quot; I thought there was no way it could miss. Being a fan of Argento's previous films I expected something of quality, something that would blow my mind. Well, all I can say is that this movie just isn't very good, and certainly not up to snuff with &quot;Suspiria,&quot; &quot;Tenebrae,&quot; &quot;Deep Red,&quot; or even &quot;Trauma.&quot; Jennifer Connelly may have been a find at the time, but this film was not to be her best work (check out &quot;Dark City&quot; or &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; instead); in addition, Donald Pleasance seems bored to death by the gratuitous chattiness of the script (at least John Carpenter didn't pad out the scares in &quot;Halloween&quot; with droning dialogue scenes).The newly-remastered Anchor Bay edition of &quot;Phenomena&quot; looks and sounds great and even has a lot of extras tacked on at the end. When the film was released in the States as &quot;Creepers,&quot; over 20 minutes were cut by the distributor, and those are restored here, but it really isn't to the film's advantage. While possibly passable at 82 minutes, &quot;Phenomena&quot; becomes damn near intolerable at close to 120, especially when you consider you could be watching one of Argento's GOOD films. The only saving grace is the last act, which takes place in an eerie, isolated mansion; there is a thrilling confrontation with the bizarre murderer...but things turn unbelievable (even for an Argento film) when not one, not two, but THREE characters show up in the same place, at the same time, just as a sheer coincidence. Come on.As much as I'm bashing it, &quot;Phenomena&quot; is NOT the worst film Dario Argento has made, but it certainly isn't very good. It's lightweight enough to perhaps convert someone who's grown tired of the &quot;Scream&quot; films, but other than that there's not much to entice the viewer.

It has a typical Argento plot, alternating endless scenes of exposition with scenes of effective tension and lurid violence, all building to a particularly crazy third act. It also has Argento's typically exquisite production values and cinematography, and a typically bizarre/fantastic Goblin score, and Jennifer Connelly acquits herself well for a teenage actor in an Argento movie. It's draggy and not particularly scary, but Argento fans should know what they're getting into (and seriously, the ending is absolutely bonkers).As for the Blu-Ray itself: Gorgeous. This version contains scenes previously cut from the non-Italian release, meaning that they are presented in subtitled Italian on slightly more weathered film, but the overall presentation has an ideal blend of sumptuous color and sharp texture, with appropriate grain throughout. The sound is nicely mixed and balanced, with much nicer low-end than some of Argento's older movies (Italian 70s productions in general are a little tinny-sounding). The bonus features are interesting, in particular a lengthy making-of featurette where the makeup designer talks about designing the climactic &#34;monster&#34; (his real-life inspiration makes the creature itself much more disturbing).Finally, as always, I feel I should point out that amazon.co.uk sells a region-free Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack of Phenomena for around 12GBP, which (even with international shipping and the exchange rate) is much cheaper than buying the Blu-Ray stateside.",4,"Great Blu-Ray, typically insane movie",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",0.2628

Jennifer Connolly is very easy on the eyes, and the soundtrack moves from a moody score by the Goblins to 80s hair metal, giving it an appropriate amount of cheese and livening things up a bit. The end chase scene / climax of the movie is also pretty shocking. Like nearly all of his other movies, the dialogue is stilted and the plot a bit incoherent, but Connolly gives the lead role some charisma and the movie looks great; no one goes to see this kind of movie for a logical plot and taut, snappy dialogue anyway.

Jennifer has a psychic affinity with insects which help provide her clues about a local serial killer.Donald Pleasance is a wheelchair-bound scientist who befriends Jennifer and assists her in investigating the killer. Fortunately, the killer likes to keep parts of the bodies, attracting flies which help Jennifer.Although the acting and writing is not very good (Connelly is still a good decade away from her Oscar caliber work), the movie makes up for it with the direction, settings and soundtrack by Goblin (who were even more effective in Suspiria) and various other musicians such as Iron Maiden and Bill Wyman. If you don't like bugs; this isn't the movie for you; in particular, this is one of the most maggot-filled movies ever. Otherwise, this is an effective - if minor - horror movie that merits watching.",4,"Creepy, effective horror",1118534400,"06 12, 2005",0.0631

Grant,"[1, 1]","Being an owner of Suspiria and a True Argento fan this is gonna sound very strange but I would have to say thet Phenomena is my favourite Argento film. It has a solid Goblin soundtrack that I think is one of their best and most atmospheric yet. Tell me if you dont love the music when Jennifer Connelly slips into one of her sleepwalks. I also think that the story as well is one of the most straight forward and easy to follow (plotwise) ones from Argento. I was very happy when Anchor Bay released this as this film was lost for years and I refused to get Creepers. The transfer is truly magnificent and the sound is very clear but the most important thing is that this is the uncut original version and not the butchered 'Creepers'. Jennifer Connelly gives an impressive performance in this film (I used to have a serious crush on her) and there isnt any evidence of any dubbing of the other actors that you normally get with Argento flicks. Im tired of the negative reviews for this film, I think that it is so well directed and stands out from many of the other crap horror films that were around in the 80's. Typically the lighting is very good (as in Suspiria, Deep Red) and the scenery is also impressive heightening the atmosphere. Argento's movies are so much different and more complex than most horror films. The film seems to flow together very well and has some genuinely scary moments and twists to boot. I love the scene at the beginning where you see the killer breaking free from the wall, also the scene involving the bath at the end. It doesnt have the dread atmosphere of Suspiria but it works. With the impressive extras and insightfull commentary track, I would recommend this to any horror fan. I also think that it is a good introduction into the world of Dario Argento whom I am starting to think is better than Lucio Fulci. Take my advise (get this now).

67,AYZV1PJP6NXPT,764005685,R. Long JaminRebel,"[0, 0]","Creepers is a pretty solid Horror movie in all aspects. If Creepers is a B-Movie, then I'd say it is a B+ Movie for all that is offers. This movie features Jennifer Connelly of movies such as Dark Water and The House of Sand and Fog. We have seen Donald Pleasant most famously in the Halloween films and so many more. Jennifer is so young in the movie to where it was almost impossible to recognize her, since I had never seen Mrs Connelly when she was young. I think what this actress showcases most in this early film is a presence of mind and timing, all while being on film. Mrs. Connelly does not seem at all intiimidated by her craft nor by her cameras. She seems to be completely in the muse of her character.What I do not see in this film are the lovely eyes of Mrs. Connelly. In her more modern films I have fallen in love with the actrecesses eyes and her often depressed or sullen characters. In films like Dark Water I just wanted to reach out to Mrs Connelly in love, because she seemed so very sad, and so much of this was portrayed through her beautiful and sad eyes. So much for the window to her SOUL. And then too there is Connelly's beautiful long hair. In Creepers I could recognize Mrs Jennifer through her long hair and the way she would face the camera and the way she would tilt her head.As for this movie, it delivers in a solid manner. The plot is neither over done nor underdeveloped. I think in fact it is just about a perfect balance. In Creepers Jennifer Connelly plays a character named Jennifer. I thought that was kinda interesting. She does go to a Swiss boarding school and in an area where a crazy psychopath is presently prowling the night, and day, killing young women. Early in this film Connelly sleepwalks right into a murder scene, and then off into the night and ultimately into the presence of the Donald Pleasance character, a man who is an entomologist, or someone who studies insects. And yes, Mrs Connelly has an affinity or some sort of telepathic connection to insects. She says she loves insects and that they will not harm her.Anyway, what I liked about the movie was, first the lovely and young Mrs Connelly and then how the movie was your basic psycho drama, and all set to the music of bands like MotorHead, Iron Maiden, Bill Wyman and so many other contemporary rock bands of the time period. I feel the Horror aspect of the film was actually ehanced by the movie soundtrack which often played loud over scenes where we would see action but mostly only hear music.The movie progresses to Mrs Connelly on a highway in a tour bus. She has a fly in a cage, one who can detect human decomposition. When the fly becomes agitated Mrs Connelly stops the bus and departs down a hill to a house. The house is vacant but she soon encounters the owner.Later in the movie a lady at the college buys Connelly a ticket to return home to her father. Mrs Jennifer stays with the college lady until the next day when her bus is scheduled to depart. It is at the home of this lady where Connelly finds out to her dismay that the college lady is one of the two psycho murderers, or is she merely protecting her mutant son??As the movie climaxes Connelly flees to a basement and falls into a pit of decaying HUMAN REMAINS, complete with the complement of MAGGOTS. On a wall by the pit is the local Inspector who is chained to a wall. Enter the psycho lady, who is grabbed as the Inspector frees one arm. The psycho lady is severely beaten in the face as she lies on the wall. Mrs Connelly escapes the pit and flees down a hall only to meet the Mutant Child who then assaults her. Mrs Connelly flees to a motor boat on a lake but does not leave the boat dock before the Mutant Child arrrives. The Mutant stuggles with Connelly in the boat and puntures the fuel tank. A fire ensues and both characters make a watery escape into the lake. A badly burned Mutant grabs Mrs Connelly again but escapes as he surfaces in the flames. Mrs Connelly makes it back onto shore. She walks up the hill and suddenly her father pulls up in his car. It quickly seems that there will be a touching reunion, and there almost was, that was before the psycho lady popped up BEHEADING THE FATHER with a piece of plate metal. So Jennifer summons her beloved INSECTS and the woman is quickly devoured and killed.All in all this was a pretty good piece of Horror. I paid one dollar for this film on VHS. My money was very well spent and I was all in all entertained. Check this movie out. It's pretty scary, especially at the end. The Donald Pleasance character has little impact upon this film, and he seems merely there for plot purposes. The CHIMP seems to have been for comededic pleasure and he or she delivered.In this film you have rotting bodies, two beheadings, maggotts, maggott flys, a chimp, sleepwalking, a mutant child killer, the protective psycho mother, telepathically controlled insects, a house with metal shudders that fall turning the house into a prison such as in seen in The House on Haunted Hill. And all of this is set to frequently loud music and some of it is vocals that deeply engrain the horror.Check this movie out.

Hedges,"[0, 0]","Creepers is a modestly scary and overtly creepy horror film starring the lovely Jennifer Connelly and Donald Pleasence as (surprise!) an eccentric scientist. Connelly is shipped off to a Swiss boarding school in an area that happens to have an insane killer on the loose. She immediately dislikes the leadership at the school, and begins sleepwalking. It turns out that she has telepathic abilities with insects, and becomes fast friends with Pleasence, a wheelchair-bound Scottish professor of entomology. Pleasence also has a helpful chimp as an assist animal, in what seems like a quirk of the plot.Connelly is disliked by the girls at the school, but is able to turn the tables by summoning her insect friends in a wonderful scene, which is my favorite in the film. After several murders Pleasence and Connelly agree on a strategy in which Connelly will use her insect ESP to detect the murderer. It's a given that this leads to no end of problems for her and Pleasence both. The plot has an interesting twist as the real murderer is unveiled. You may not be surprised, but the revelation is still traumatic and very creepy. The film then has multiple false endings that involve a motorboat, a mutant, an insect swarm, a highly improbable fire, a tearful reunion, and a vengeful chimp (not necessarily in the order in which you would expect).The film is gross, particularly at the very beginning and very end, and suffers from some bad heavy metal music in inappropriate places, but while it is largely predictable (and Donald Pleasence is his usual hammy self), it is a decent combination of psychological and physical horror that will be pleasing to fans of the genre.",3,"Donald Pleasence, A Somnambulistic Entomologist, And A Chimp...How Can You Go Wrong?,",1204675200,"03 5, 2008",-0.3058

There is a killer on the loose slaughtering the students, and Jennifer finds herself alienated and unpopular; especially after they discover her love for bugs.Donald Pleasance, who is most well known for his role as Dr.Loomis in the Halloween series, plays a wheel-chair bound Entimologist with a helpful pet chimp named Inga.Honestly, Inga was my favorite character in the movie. Best acting, hands down. But, then again, I have a weird love for monkees and all things chimps, so maybe i am just biased.Jennifer Connelly was lovely to look at, but her acting was underdeveloped and hard to stomach at times. Seriously, one second she would be screaming for help and crying, the next second she would be peaceful looking and happy, then BAM!, back to screaming and terrified. It was unsettling.Another strange thing I have noticed about Dario films, is that his murder victims are rarely introduced or talked about. One second we are watching a girl walk around, the next she is being killed. No names or backstory to the character. It's really strange. I personally would like a little more character info before someone gets wacked. It would lead to the tension a little more.The death scenes are horrific as always since Dario likes his gore, but they aren't too extreme. It seems Dario has a love for his victims smashing through glass windows, since it occurred in Suspiria and also in the first murder scene of this film. I did find it kind of annoying that we are almost INSTANTLY aware that our killer is either A.) A midget, B.) An Animal, or C.) Something supernatural that is small of stature....since the first victim was staring DOWN at it as it chased her.Another slightly irksome issue I had with this film was the heavy metal score at certain moments throughout the movie. It was WAY, WAY too attention diverting and loud. Goblin (Dario's standard horror score creators) should have stuck with the typical, synthisized, moody orchestrations that add more drama to the scenes. I thought the non-heavy metal moments were totally fine.Overall, I think that with better actors and more enhanced characters, this movie could have been a true gem.
