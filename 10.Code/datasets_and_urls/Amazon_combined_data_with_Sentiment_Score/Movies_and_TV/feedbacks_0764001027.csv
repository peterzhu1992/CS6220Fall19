Thompson's first book, HELLS ANGELS: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, which also debuted in '67.This anachronistic 'cycle movie was scripted by R. Wright Campbell, screenwriter for Roger Corman'sMACHINE GUN KELLY(1958),TEENAGE CAVE MAN(1958) andTHE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH(1964), also one of Jimmy Cagney's more unusual films,MAN OF A THOUSAND FACES(1957), a loose bio of Lon Chaney Sr.Director Richard Rush is perhaps best known forFREEBIE AND THE BEAN(1974), a buddy cop action comedy.Most synopses of Hells Angels on Wheels make note of an event that occurs late and provides the story's climactic confrontation. My impression is it was thought up as a way of getting THE END on the screen. The film meanders, as does its cast of bikers, from this skirmish to the next riot, from one opportunity for anarchistic fun to another. A gang of unwashed, unrepentant aging children spend their days outside of gainful employment looking for adventure and whatever comes our way, to quote a popular Steppenwolf song of the times.As for music, a repetitive lyric of the picture's main tune, Study in Motion #1 (by the Poor) sums up the lives of these miscreants: Moving but going nowhere. There's drug-fueled chaotic orgies where girls who foolishly trip with the gang get passed from one greasy Angel to the next, a biker marriage ceremony with character actor Bruno VeSota as minister that seems an excuse to scoff at this societal convention, and a sequence where an old man's early '50s car is forced off the road and down an embankment by the mischievous thugsters (ha ha ha, wasn't that a trip?).The music, the chain and tire iron fights, the cruising from one misadventure to the next is wearisome. Not even a young and somewhat charming Jack Nicholson brings enough to the party to save this mess.",2,Cin&eacute;ma v&eacute;rit&eacute; on wheels,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",-0.0688

4,A2XW6Y6NS70JSV,764001027,M. B. DaVega pop culture historian,"[1, 1]","This low-budget, 60's-fare biker movie was OKAY. Two years before his star-making turn in Easy Rider, Jack Nicholson ---- just 30 years old at the time ---- starred here in Hells Angels On Wheels (1967) as Poet, a disgruntled full-service gas station attendant who rides off from his job in protest on his own motorcycle just as a massive fleet of motorcyclists ---- the notorious Hells Angels ---- are passing through his town right by on Main Street. He incidentally ends up getting into a tussle later with one of the Angels, but their leader, Buddy (Adam Roarke) is impressed enough with the way Poet handles himself during the fight that he allows Poet to tag along with the group, and eventually he's accepted as one of them.This movie is charmingly dated but the story never really seemed to go anywhere. In between pyschedelic-style parties and fleeing from the police, the group spends most of the film just tooling around on their bikes aimlessly, getting into a free-for-all brawl every other scene. The numerous fight scenes are less-than-exciting, a fact that is made worse by the tacky and silly 60's musical score which is decidedly unbefitting of an action sequence. I also didn't much care for the ending, either, which I found to be negative, unresolved and abrupt.This movie shows its age but overall, I suppose it can be forgiven for its flaws due to its fun, well-stated performances throughout the cast, great outdoor scenerey and shots during the riding sequences and its overall campy, nostalgic charm just based on the fact that it was the sixties. Might still be worth a look if you're a hardcore biker movie fan or a fan of nostalgia like I am, but just don't expect too much from it.Also stars the very pretty brunette Sabrina Scharf, who would also appear in Easy Rider two years later.NOT rated X!

Too bad about Adam Roarke. He was a good guy, a pretty good actor, stunt man and.... well he died a little before his time. I could call myself a biker but my Kawasaki Z1R although quick doesn't quite fit the image of a Harley Davidson. Some how Jack Nicholson just doesn't fit in either.

No bite no bang and way too much buck. The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room. Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers. Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot. If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride. That's a biker flick. This is yet another example of how phony the 60's were.

This is one of Jack Nicholson's early movies and Adam Roarke does a great job as the leader . It is a good story about a loner who it tired of playing the straight game and quits his job at a gas station . Later that night he runs into the Hells Angels at a bar and ends up prospecting for the club. The original bobbers are so cool as they are the real machines of the day . Great fight scenes , great riding scenes , a 60's love in party and a cameo apearence in the beginning of the film by Sonny Barger himself really puts the touch to the film !

12,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,764001027,Wuchak,"[1, 1]","Biker films came into vogue after the 1966 release of the infamous The Wild Angels; they remained popular for the next 5-7 years or so. This time in history was the era of the counter culture, people who rebelled against the status quo of the culture at large (and with good reason). The counter culture was comprised of three basic groups. The two extreme groups were the hippie flower children, who believed in peace, free love & drug experimentation and the bikers who were similar except they believed in brawling and had shorter hair, not to mention their drug of choice was alcohol. The third group was comprised of everyone inbetween.Hell's Angels on Wheels was released in 1967, one year after The Wild Angels, and it's a pretty decent biker flick. You'll see some clips of famed Angel Sonny Barger near the beginning of the film; Barger also assisted as the technical advisor.THE STORY: Jack Nickolson loses his job as a gas station attendant and hooks up with the Hell's Angels as Poet. The bikers ride, revel and brawl throughout the story while Poet takes an interest in the leader's girlfriend (Adam Roarke and Sabrina Scharf respectively).The Wild Angels [aka All the Fallen Angels] is a cult masterpiece for numerous reasons despite its obvious shortcomings: It takes the subject of outcast bikers seriously, it's truly shocking, its story is refreshingly original and it tackles real-life issues that every viewer can relate to, specifically the nature of grief and how different people respond in different ways [see my review for details]. Although Hell's Angels on Wheels is good for what it is -- a late 60s low-budget biker flick -- it fails to even come close to the greatness of The Wild Angels. It's slightly more goofy, not at all shocking and has little depth.Yet, it's worthwhile for numerous reasons: It's great to see Jack Nicholson when he was so young, there are numerous beautiful 60's babes and the California photography is exceptional, in particular in the last 30 minutes of its 95 minute runtime, not to mention all the bikes.However, throughout the almost pointless story various questions kept coming to mind:-- How do the bikers get money to support their lifestyle of continuous riding, revelry and free love? (work is never mentioned as it is in The Wild Angels)-- In light of the numerous brawls (with fists, chains, clubs, etc.) why do none of the bikers ever show any injuries, bruises, etc.?-- If the bikers party this much this often, what are they gonna look like (and feel like) when they're 35? 40? 45? 50?-- If these guys don't actually work, have very little money and don't take baths, why are these gorgeous babes riding with 'em?-- The leader's supposed girlfriend is shown to be a very loose woman who believes in free love, getting it on with any dude as the whim strikes her. She also shows a loyalty to the leader, which I fail to understand in light of his infidelities. So why is Poet so fascinated with her to the point of wanting to marry her? Is he nuts? Marrying such a woman would last about a week, or less.Some complain about the quick ending, but it would have worked if they had worked out the kinks in the death scene. I don't want to say anymore because I don't wanna give anything away.PERSONAL GRADE: Borderline C+ or B-",3,Young Jack Nicholson as a Hell's Angel,1220313600,"09 2, 2008",0.2139
