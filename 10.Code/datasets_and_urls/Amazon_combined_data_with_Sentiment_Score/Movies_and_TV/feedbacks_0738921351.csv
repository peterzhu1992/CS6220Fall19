I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for Slim Whitman's cheesy lip-synch attempt. I could have done without that.",4,what a surprise....,960163200,"06 5, 2000",0.1656
1,AW3VZ5O895LRK,738921351,carol irvin carol irvin,"[8, 12]","My husband Jim and I watched this together and we had very different reactions. Jim thought that actor Jim Carrey did a better job of playing Andy Kaufmann in the &quot;Man In The Moon&quot; movie than the real Andy K did doing his act. While Jim's busy rejecting the real thing, I am convulsed with laughter watching the tape, holding my sides! Perhaps one clip shows our division better than any other. There's Jim seriously watching Andy K talking to the interviewer about keeping his humility by working as a busboy, while being a big tv star, and there's me, absolutely incredulous that Jim can't see that Andy K is putting him/us on! Andy never breaks character and always comes across as wholly sincere and white, middle class while making the most outrageous claims. I'd give it a 5. I think Jim would give it a 2 but, since I'm filling this out, it gets a 4! Ok, maybe you do need an odd sense of humor to enjoy him but he was a hit in his day, wasn't he?",4,A Real Familial Division Of Opinion,963792000,"07 17, 2000",0.1099
2,A1VMEBPPFUU0J7,738921351,C. Manson,"[8, 8]","This sensational DVD, culled from a TV show I have cloudy memories of from my youth, presents Andy Kaufman in a way that surpasses the Milos Forman biopic (not to denigrate Jim Carrey's outstanding performance) and the A&amp;E Biography. You get it all here, and it's mostly hilarious. Best of all is Mr. Kaufman's dead-on Elvis impersonation...his choice of songs is impeccable--&quot;Too Much&quot; is an Elvis hit that Mr. Presley seldom performed live. Great introduction (or reintroduction?) to this fascinating character.",5,Andy's Greatest Hits,955929600,"04 17, 2000",0.5637
3,A24MFKJNHJDVZF,738921351,Mel Zorro,"[3, 3]","This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available, it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling the ladies-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda, Bob Shapiro, etc.)Basically, if you loved Man on the Moon, you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!",5,Andy's finest performance,1209513600,"04 30, 2008",0.5913
4,ANVMYQWSEWUJX,738921351,Michael R. Schneider,"[8, 10]","It's a shame that Andy left us so soon, yet one rarely falls into the category of &quot;legend&quot; with out succumbing to mortality. Anybody interested enough in Andy to be reading this review probably recognizes at least a hint of his comic genius, therefore I will not expound on this subject.This DVD is, beyond a doubt, the most comprehensive compendium of Andy Kaufman's acts yet availablke on this format, and it is all in one show. You get everything, as mentioned in the description up top and many other reviews. As a primer to Andy, this disc is well worth buying. As an adition to the collection of a long-time Kaufman plan, this DVD fits in perfectly with your collection.",5,The Best Kaufman DVD... So Far,965692800,"08 8, 2000",0.2362

I'll take any Andy Kaufman than NO ANDY KAUFMAN. I especially love the part about &quot;Imitations&quot;.
