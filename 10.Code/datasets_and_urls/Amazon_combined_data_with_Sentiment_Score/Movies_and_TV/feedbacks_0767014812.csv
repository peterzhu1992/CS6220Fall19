Forester's &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower.&quot; The movies' writers have done an excellent job of transferring the novel to the screen. Although they have made changes that may offend some Hornblower purists, I found the changes worked well in this medium. There is plenty of action with sea and land battles, as well as individual acts of heroism. But the characters are also developed in the writing and in the superb performances by a very talented cast.The DVDs are well done. The video looks very good, considering that this was originally made for television. The picture is sharp and the colors are true. The sound is good, though it won't strain your system. The disks are surprisingly well stocked with supplemental material. The first two movies provide a bio of Forester and a glossary of nautical terms in text. The third disk contains the &quot;making of&quot; documentary that was shown on A&amp;E and the History Channel when the series was originally aired. And the last disk contains a documentary about the Royal Navy, contrasting Nelson's era with the present. This show is hosted by (Prince) Edward Windsor and originally appeared as one of the Great Ships episodes on the History Channel.Any fan of the Hornblower novels should see this series. Any fan of historical movies should see this series. Any one who enjoys a good movie that tells a story full of heroism and honor should see this series!

As you watch the film, you may be reminded of the antics of James Bond in the 007 series, where it is the combination of brains and brawn that triump over adversity. Horatio Hornblower has been gifted with these same attributes however he is younger, innocent in the ways of the world, and respectful of authority that is James Bond. I say that Horatio is innocent in the ways of the world and yet when he confronts evil or hubris, he responds with wise action every time. Is this realistic? No. Is it fun? Yes, and very entertaining. This episode is divided into two parts. In the first half Horatio, his loyal men, and a pompous bureaucrat must purchase supplies from an Iranian village and encounter plague. They must be quarantined for weeks before they can join the rest of the fleet. A young, crazed member of his crew continues to test Horatio's patience throughout the ordeal. In the second half, Horatio studies for his lieutenant's exam, only to have his orals interrupted as the Spanish send a fire ship into an English harbor to wreck havoc. It is then that Horatio shows that he is a man of action and bravery to his superiors. The acting and photography are first class.

These adventures are, in fact, a way for Horatio Hornblower to see the hardships that officials have to endure: he has to be prepared to take quick, life-or-death decissions for himself and his men; he has to be very sure of his priorities to take these decissions; and his priorities are not exactly the same as those of some other very well-regarded officials, who are considered heros and who could become new and powerful enemies.

18,A294XIDCE087BB,767014812,Irreverent irreverent,"[10, 10]","If I had to pick one best DVD production, this would be it. This set and the sequel show what the medium is capable of at its best. It matches the 1995 A&E; Pride and Prejudice set artistically, which I frankly did not expect so soon. Technically, the video and audio are unsurpassed, MUCH better than P&P.; The accompanying special features, instead of being the useless afterthoughts we so often get, are lengthy, informative, well done, and constitute a real bonus almost as worthy as the episodes themselves.Gruffudd and Lindsay lead a marvelous cast, utterly superb down to the most minor players. I often was sorry when a great supporting role ended, imagining how much could have been developed with more time. The tars and midshipmen who worked alongside Hornblower were my favorite supporting actors, along with a few crotchety captains of all nationalities, the best being perhaps the Spanish Prison governor.Hornblower is superbly researched and produced, including a full-sized ship built from authentic plans and materials, and attention to every detail of costume, speech, warfare, terminology, technology, sociology, administration, whatever it took to transport us back 200 years. The video, videography, and sound are outstanding. A storm sequence (in the sequel) enveloped the whole room because I wired my DVD player's sound through my stereo (EASY to do and MUCH cheaper than home theater systems). I felt almost as though I were right on the deck myself and was glad to be warm and dry.Hornblower isn't just about swashbuckling. Hollywood thinks sex means skin, but here we learn that brains, confidence, and action are sexier than hammering us with sweaty nudity. My female friends indicate reactions, especially to Gruffudd and Lindsay, that go well beyond my great appreciation of the acting. In fact, the Hornblower DVD's are becoming notorious for setting feminine hearts aflutter. However, guys, there are delectable tidbits for us, too. I confess to difficulty in maintaining objectivity about the Duchess, the French schoolmarm, and the Spanish Colonel's lady. These strong, smart, courageous, women are the sort I would want at my side in any era, and are quite delicious in the bargain, which is how I imagine women react to the male players. The sexiness fits seamlessly into the proceedings, with nary a gratuitous exploitative scene to cheapen it. The original Hornblower books did include a French sweetheart, so I can forgive contriving to include the teacher.The appeal of Hornblower comes from several facets. It respects our intelligence. Things make sense; they could have happened as depicted. The characters seem real - good actors make us forget they are acting. We do not have to suspend disbelief (except that after a while, it seems unlikely that one person could be so lucky). We identify with the players. Hornblower reminds me of myself as a young soldier learning to lead and occasionally having to beat the system. Pellew reminds me of myself as a professor expecting the best of students, but with respect and affection. The crewmen are so like my students, my fellow grunts in the ditches at the refinery, and my comrades in the Army. The women are my dreams. These things are what hooks me, but there is something to hook every viewer, as all my friends who have seen Hornblower attest.I am brutal about a DVD's weaknesses, so take this as significant: THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST DVD STUFF. BUY IT -- YOU WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.",5,Superb in every respect,1012694400,"02 3, 2002",0.4492
19,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,767014812,John D. Cofield,"[8, 10]","Horatio Hornblower is a brilliant recreation of the days of the wooden sailing ship, when the Royal Navy really did rule the waves. This series is an adaptation of C.S. Forrester's Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, which is chronologically speaking the first of a series of books following Hornblower's career. (Forrester actually wrote several books which come later in the series before taking up Hornblower's midshipman years, but that doesn't really matter to today's readers and watchers). The four episodes included in this series are beautifully done, and you really understand what life was like above and below decks. The soaring, spirited music further enhances the series. England and France are locked in combat, and Hornblower, a 17 year old midshipman, finds himself on the front lines. He visibly matures from a callow lad who gets sea sick when the ship is in harbor to a determined and ingenious leader. He is admired by virtually everybody on board, from his fellow midshipmen to the captains to the crew to the varied group of civilians who sometimes ride along as passengers. He faces down an angry rival, captures and is captured byFrench and Spanish enemies, and even abandons ship and escapes from prison with dash and derring do.

21,A8TZ88OM8YOLW,767014812,MartyHansen,"[13, 14]","The story is purely English, but the message is quintessentially American; succeed based upon one's own ability, regardless of class or lineage. Horatio Hornblower (played by Ioan Gruffudd) is brave, intelligent, and as we discover, a natural born leader, and the envy of every man. We all wish we could be like him.This A&E; made-for-TV series is an accurate representation of the C.S. Forester novels upon which they are based. These first four episodes deal with Hornblower's early years as a midshipman after he joins the British Navy when it was the uncontested ruler of the high seas.Episode one sees Hornblower fall under the control of Simpson, an abusive senior midshipman. Horatio contemplates suicide and desertion, but instead challenges Simpson to a duel. A cruel twist spares his life - but takes that of his friend. He later exemplifies himself in battle, and cunningly outsmarts a rival French captain to begin earning the undying loyalty and affection of his men.War with France breaks out in episode two, and Hornblower is transferred to the British frigate, the Indefatigable, commanded by Captain Pellew (played wonderfully by Robert Lindsay), who will become, over time, almost a second father to his young charge. Horatio will again distinguish himself towards the movie's end by risking his life to board a burning fire ship (a blazing vessel sent pilotless and kamikaze style into the British fleet) and diverting it away from the Indefatigable. Captain Pellew later congratulates him for saving his ship and the lives of everyone on board. Horatio's pride soars, as does the love we feel for him.In episode three, Hornblower learns much about life - and women - when he and an English Duchess (who is really an actress) are taken prisoners by the Spanish. A French Captain threatens to reveal them as spies, but the Duchess gives up her honor to preserve their secret. Horatio is at first disgusted, but then respects her immeasurably once he realizes that her pragmatism has probably saved both of their lives. Hornblower later displays unquestionable bravery when he leads a rescue party to save sailors stranded offshore during a storm. His gallantry earns him his freedom, and Horatio gains the distinction of being recognized as a hero in both his own country and by his enemies.In the final episode, the crew of the Indefatigable is asked to assist French Royalist soldiers in an ill-fated attempt to recapture the country from the Republic. The pomp & circumstance of the well-disciplined British army are used gloriously against the enemy. And a reinstated French Marquis employs the guillotine to lop off a few heads - but in the end suffers a similar fate. Horatio falls in love with a beautiful French girl only to lose her. And he painfully learns that duty -- and the responsibility of leading men in battle -- must always win out over his emotions.This A&E; series was a visual and inspirational delight.

Again and again, plots, incidents and characters have been altered from those set forth in Forester's novel &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower&quot; and in every instance the screenwriter's decision has cheapened or weakened the end product. Worst of all have been the attempts at &quot;political correctness.&quot; I can never remember Hornblower being portrayed as being so buddy-buddy with the common seaman, Forester (accurately) depicted the distant if respectful relationship between the two seafaring classes. And Hornblower never never NEVER expressed any sympathy for the French Revolution! The scene where the French villagers sing the Marseillese while their compatriots are executed never appeared in the novel and was of course blatantly stolen from &quot;Casablanca.&quot; (I might add that in my opinion that cretins who burn works of art for firewood and use rare books to prop up table legs deserve anything they get!)

To watch these episodes is almost like reading the Forester novels themselves. The best part of this series is that it gets you to feel the life of a seaman of that time. The sounds of the ship, the bells, whistles, drum beats, etc. all merge together and bring you back into another time. While I always felt that the Hornblower books give a somewhat romanitzed view of Royal Navy life during the Napoleanic Wars, there can be no doubt that this TV series truly does justice to the books. More productions should be made like this. Hornblower's exploits while impressive, are believeable. There is none of that annoying tongue and cheek element that we find in many of these period productions. The Sharpe Series was largely ruined because of that. Here there has been a conscious effort to stay within the spirit of the books.The best episodes in my opinion are 1 and 4. The middle ones are a bit slow and tedious a times, but they all provide wonderful character development. The fourth episode is a real treat for those interested in having a look at combined naval and land operations of the period. The British were the only ones that could do this sort of thing, and the coordination involved was very difficult. The viewer is treated to some interesting land combat scenes, which are nicely done. Much attention has been paid to uniforms, drill and eqippment, which all get high marks. John Mollo was the costume specialist, so its not surprsing that the uniforms are accurate to the buttons! He did many fine military uniform books in years past.Perhaps what makes this series so good is that there has been no silly romance put in to distract the viewer.

The acting was supurb, the costumes brilliant, and the ships and sets took my breath away. In a time where computer animations are stealing the scene, this movie shows just how good the real thing looks. There is a scene of the ship sailing in with all hands in dress uniforms standing at attention on the yards that must be seen. The whole series leads up to that image, and it is worth every penny it cost to build, rig, and crew those ships! I can only hope that with the success of Hornblower that we may soon see Patrick O'Brians Aubrey &amp; Maturin series adapted by the same team!",5,Stunning!,951177600,"02 22, 2000",0.319

The British adaptation of the series of C.S. Forrester novels is richly detailed, and with writing as intelligent and human as you will find in any action-adventure film. This is not just another television show on DVD, these stories are worth seeing over and over again.",5,Horatio Hornblower,1269648000,"03 27, 2010",0.0463
