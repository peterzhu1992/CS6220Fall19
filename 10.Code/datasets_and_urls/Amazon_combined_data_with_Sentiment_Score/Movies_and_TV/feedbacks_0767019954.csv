3,ABF3QWEDXI90X,767019954,Brit Lit/Brit Flick Fan,"[7, 9]","The novel Vanity Fair is subtitled by the author A Novel Without a Hero. Becky Sharp is the first anti-heroine in English literature. Thakeray looks down his nose at all of his characters. After getting into the novel you discover that the author himself is the hero of the novel in that he thinks his intelligence and opinions are far better than anyone elses. With that understood you can sit back and enjoy his biting observations of the hypocracy of English society of the time: the arbitrary class divisions, the frantic scrambling to find a suitable (read Wealthy) husband, and the leeming-like rush for everyone in the upper classes to live well beyond there means at the very real risk of bankrupcy.This is not Austen with a put-upon heroine that you can identify with. This is not Dickens with suffering and noble Poor and where goodness is always rewarded.This A&E;/BBC version is a very close adaptation of the book and does not sugar-coat anything. The cast may be unfamiliar with American audiences, but it includes some of the finest character actors that Britain has to offer. The story is not easy in that it is not formulaic, but the entire production from screenplay to casting and acting, to period details is a feast.

Employed as governess to the wealthy Crawley family, Becky wastes no time in seducing younger son Rawdon (Nathaniel Parker) and marrying him despite the hefty objections of the fearsome matriarch Miss Crawley (Miriam Margolyes). But when Becky decides to tangle with the influential-yet dangerous Lord Steyne (Gerard Murphy), it may lead to her ultimate ruin...Providing the effective counterpoint to Becky's quest for money and station is the tale of her best friend Amelia Sedley (Frances Grey). In love with the roguish George Osborne (Tom Ward), but admired from afar by his best friend William Dobbin (Philip Glenister), Amelia is the true heart and soul of Thackeray's story. Of course, the great irony is that Amelia pines after a man who actually never existed (the faithful and true George is actually an uncaring and womanising bore).Natasha Little is the perfect actress to bring to life Thackeray's anti-heroine, and her portrayal of Becky carries the series nicely. Frances Grey is the picture of innocence as the deceptively-fragile Amelia. As one would expect from a BBC period drama, the supporting cast is very strong and includes Charlotte West-Oram, Michele Dotrice, Jeremy Swift, Janine Duvitski, Patsy Rowlands, David Bradley, Eleanor Bron and Sylvestra Le Touzel (whom BBC fans will remember as Fanny in Mansfield Park).",4,treacherous little trollop...,1145145600,"04 16, 2006",0.6142

I mean, it's a BBC production so what can go wrong? I'm not a purist and I've actually never read the book (kudos to everyone that did, looks like some serious reading) so I'm just basing this review purely on the viewing experience.Overall, the story was, hmmm. . . . not necessarily boring but not OMG, I can't wait to see what happens next! (If that makes any sense.) It was more the banter and wit of the dialogue plus a touch of curiosity that kept things interesting enough for me to continue watching rather than the plot. The plot is pretty much a steady case of a girl who attempts to rise in wealth and social status through trial and error. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately, the execution is was a bit of a one-note. Nothing terribly exciting. Natasha Little's conniving and status-hungry Becky Sharp, however, somewhat saves the film by tap dancing on your nerves, which I gather from the other reviews, she's supposed to do. So good acting on Little's part. Naturally, there is a romantic side plot. Not focusing on Becky Sharp, mind you, but that of Becky's very, VERY naive (and that's putting it nicely) friend, Amelia Sedley who is consumed by her love for George Osborne while Osborne's friend, William Dobbin, is secretly in love with her. Personally, I liked this storyline better but I'm more of a romantic so of course, I'll gravitate toward that.Production-wise, the film seemed more like a glorified stage play. I actually double checked the dvd case to make sure that this was really made in the 90s. Seemed more like an 80s production to me. Also, as some reviewers have already mentioned, the blaring horns are a bit overkill. I kept having to adjust the volume on my TV throughout the movie.I found myself very fortunate to have purchased this movie in one of those buy and trade movie stores--I would have been very upset if I had paid full price then had to wait this to arrive. But obviously, there are many out there who just love this film so my suggestion is simply to rent this one first then decide on whether you think it's buyable. If it were possible, I would give this film 2.5 stars but considering Little's and Philip Glenister's (Mjr. Dobbin) performances, I'll be generous.

9,A2XA9PCCNS8UA8,767019954,Elisabeth Altieri,"[21, 23]","Andrew Davies is a very clever man with, I suspect, quite a tender heart. I don't know how he draws out these old novels for us the way he does, but he's done it again here. I have to admit, the first time I saw this production, I liked it, but was left a little cold. The second time I saw it, I knew it was just me, and that it takes a viewer accustomed to mediocrity some time to readjust to this kind of brilliance. The costumes and sets, in the hot Oriental colours of the real Regency instead of the too often misrendered pastels of the earlier Georgians, are well done and the acting and casting are great. Davies, cleverly, put some of the wry observations of the narrative passages into the mouths of the characters. &quot;I must say, Dr. Hume, if a man's character is to be abused, there's nobody like a relation to do the business.&quot; David Bradley is old Sir Pitt is himself, in fact, the whole Queen's Crawley contingent will make you both laugh and squirm, just like they're supposed to. Janine Duvitski as marvelous as the ghastly, grasping Mrs. Bute Crawley. Natasha Little is luminously beautiful as Becky Sharp, her careless curls at unsettling contrast with her little smirk. Amelia Sedley is so wet you could ring her out (Thackeray predicted my criticism of her character, by the way) but Frances Grey plays her so well you admire her, as you do all of them, for just being the flawed creatures they are.You will find the inhabitants of this fair very much alive and not at all like puppets, as Thackeray disingenuously tells you they are all through his book. The visuals well support the spirit of the production. There is one scene of Dobbin and Osbourne conversing outside their barracks, and the camera then raises into an extreme high shot that makes them look exactly like toy soldiers or pictures on a chocolate box. It's the shot often used to film a football game or the square formations of the old battlefields, so we are reminded that what became almost quaint in the ensuing two hundred years was once very real. The battlefield scenes are up close and personal, noisy and ugly, from the grim patience of the Dobbins and Osbournes, the foot soldiers who carried the terrible day of the Battle of Waterloo, to the hard breathing and slamming together of metal and flesh as the cavalry engages.The score has disturbed some people, but it's as brilliant as the adaptation and delivers the feel of the period directly. It's hard to say why it works, but there's no question that it does, and anachronism only serves as a friend, here. Like Becky's wonderful, new remarks, which I'm sure she really made, &quot;Baisez mon cul.&quot; and &quot;I'm sorry I'm laughing, your ladyship, but I just can't help it.&quot; When I actually saw the band at Vauxhall Gardens, they provided me my bearings, like finding a &quot;You Are Here&quot; on a map. The songs are placed perfectly. When Becky's entertaining at home, her occasional flat notes don't seem to be noticed by the men in her thrall, and Becky similiarly winning over the gyneocracy with her &quot;Dido's Lament&quot; (sans the flat notes) at the Steyne House soiree is not to be missed.The story itself, whatever it's about, whether it's just a puppet show or one of the most profound, tender observations of human life ever put to paper, is delivered faithfully, without sentiment, but with more of the buried tenderness of the author than he would ever own up to. The ending, where these inhabitants of Vanity Fair learn to recover from glamorous war and get on with the business of becoming unexciting Victorians, and where a mysterious bad girl is saved by the intervention of a cheeky, innocent little boy is delivered in this production in all its beauty. But never mind that. As it was not about pastel interiors, the real Regency was not about sentimentality. Somebody said that all authors are in love with their childhood. Even though this was the work of a Victorian, born in 1811, and even if he did not properly approve of her, I think Thackeray was in love with his wicked, plucky little heroine, as he was in love with the period in which she flourished. Perhaps he is the curious little boy walking up the casino steps into the past and into that strange world of what appear to be grown-up people with their masks and secrets. When he gets there, he finds this particular grownup needs him. In fact, it's almost as if she's waiting for him to let him know she is not so strong on her own, and to remember her and to please be sure to write about her. We certainly need Andrew Davies and his adaptations. See what you think of this one.

I can only speak for myself and my wife, but we found this DVD riveting. One of the most absorbing BBC productions we've seen. Andrew Davies here seems to be criticized for straying too far from the text, and in other adaptations of not straying far enough. Well, all I can say is that this tale, and this filming, were perfect. Enjoyed the music, which was beautifully composed and appropriately harsh for a very harsh tale, admired the direction, found the characters compelling and believable, and loved the subtle and deft touches throughout in which character was revealed oh so skillfully. An though the acting was impeccable, three actors deserve special accolades. Tim Woodward, a face I had not seen before, is gripping as John Osborne, the conflicted and tormented father who loves and desires and hopes and fears and bullies. Nathaniel Parker, recently seen in Bleak House as a dim-witted and selfish fool, is exquisite, showing us with eyes and mouth the pains, the torments, and the heartbreak of a man who suddenly realizes he has been sucker-punched. The good-hearted, naive, and silly Joseph Sedley, a character it would be all-too-easy to laugh at, is portrayed without malice by a charming Jeremy Swift. Other wonders abound, from the smallest characters up to Becky herself, the toxic blend of a beauty we want to trust and an evil that is all too painfully exposed.We bought in completely. Compared to the Witherspoon version, far more gorgeous and spectacular, but ultimately lame and vapid, this is astounding. A delight from start to finish. If a novel is filmed, and the result is nearly perfect, even if the original plot was abused, I do not care. Think of David Lean's Great Expectations, related to, but freely adapted from, a sprawling masterpiece, and an absolutely riveting piece of cinema. That was a great film from a glorious book. If the film substantially alters the novel's themes, or pretties up the author's vision, well, that is unpardonable. But no such transformation happens here. To compress 800 pages and a multitude of characters even into 6 hours, well concessions must be made. I cannot help but believe that Thackery would be quite pleased with these choices.",5,Not precisely the Thackery novel....OK so what?,1154908800,"08 7, 2006",0.329
14,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,767019954,Jeffrey Leach,"[12, 13]","I read William Makepeace Thackeray's novel &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; the only novel of his I have read, back in February of this year. I was hesitant to do so at first because I heard many negative comments about the book from several people whose opinions I respect. I am happy to report that the book is a splendid novel, full of vibrant characters that soon come to feel like living, breathing creatures under Thackeray's masterful pen. The book was so spectacular that when I learned an American film version starring Reese Witherspoon is set to arrive sometime next year I looked forward to seeing it. Fortunately, an individual with fantastic knowledge about foreign films quickly alerted me to the existence of this BBC adaptation of Thackeray's masterpiece. Released over here in the U.S. by A&amp;E, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; runs for nearly six magical hours. The first time I watched this production, back in the summer, it took me only one day to view because I simply couldn't turn it off. I recently watched &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; again and realized I really ought to put this on my Christmas list because it is that good. I would start watching American television again if I could see productions of this caliber on a regular basis.&quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; set in the years surrounding Napoleon's resurgence in Europe, traces the rise and fall of two young British women, Rebecca Sharp and Amelia Sedley. The two young ladies meet in a sort of finishing school and when the time to reenter society arrives, Amelia takes Rebecca home with her to meet the family. The Sedley clan is comfortably upper middle class, with the father earning a nice living speculating on government bonds. Also home in time to greet the two is Amelia's buffoonish brother Jos, recently returned from his minor government post in India. Becky, an orphan who is essentially a gold digger of epic proportions, attempts to attach herself to the portly and arrogant Jos with hilarious results. Amelia looks forward to reacquainting herself with George Osborne, the son of one of her father's business partners and a first class cad. Nearby is William Dobbin, George's best friend and a decent man who has a huge crush on the clueless Amelia. Jos soon ruins any chance he has with Becky when he gets drunk on a group outing. From this point forward, a vast array of hilarious yet contemptible characters prance across Thackeray's stage.As Dobbin and Osborn head off to continental Europe to fight against Napoleon, Becky obtains a job as a governess for a deteriorating noble family called the Crawleys. Sharp's job soon finds her embroiled in the tumultuous politics of this clan as all of the family members vie with each other in an attempt to curry favor from the rich but ailing Miss Crawley. It isn't too long before Becky receives a marriage proposal from the patriarch of the family at about the same time she runs off with the man's son. As Sharp navigates through the convoluted realms of the rich and powerful in an effort to secure for herself a better social position, Amelia encounters her own problems. The family loses its money with Napoleon's defeat and must find a way to survive. The quick marriage between Amelia and George ends just as rapidly when Osborne dies on the battlefield, leaving behind a pregnant Amelia and an infuriated elder Osborne who wants nothing to do with his son's widow. Caught in the middle is Dobbin, who desperately wishes to make Amelia his own but cannot bring himself to compete with the memory of dearly departed George. The fun of reading and watching &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is in seeing how all of these disparate threads come together in the end.The BBC production of Thackeray's work does a wonderful job of adapting his novel to television. Only a few scenes in the book fail to make an appearance here, something I consider as a sign of a successful production. Where &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; the television movie succeeds most is in the cast chosen to portray the diverse characters. I happened to read a version of the book that included the original drawings that accompanied Thackeray's story, and I must say that it is obvious the producers of this movie studied these sketches in detail. One need only look at the resemblance actor Gerard Murphy's Lord Steyne has to the pictures in the novel to recognize how closely the producers followed Thackeray's vision. The whole cast does a marvelous job of mirroring the characters in &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; but Natasha Little as Rebecca Sharp deserves special mention. Her performance is tremendous, and the transformation she undergoes from a slightly pretty schoolgirl to a stunning beauty with social rank is amazing. Moreover, Little captures perfectly Becky's barely contained scorn for those around her. With a roll of the eyes, a slight shrug of the shoulders, and a mischievous grin she devastatingly disparages all of the nonsense going on around her. You simply cannot help but like her. As bad as Becky Sharp is as a person, Thackeray throws you a curve ball at the end that upends everything we think we know about her.I liked the DVD presentation, although there aren't any extras to speak of on the discs. One thing that did surprise me about this production was the booming background music that fires up from time to time. It's a type of spicy music replete with blatting horns, and the first time it came on it nearly blew my speaker system out. I ended up enjoying the music, though, as it seemed to add an element of whimsy to many scenes that are, frankly, whimsical. I simply don't have anything bad to say about this movie.

Kara Russell Actress/Artist/Musician/Writer,"[10, 10]","This is brisk, fun production that doesn't take itself any more seriously than it should, and doesn't mind winking at us with a secret smile at the same time. The story of Becky Sharp, a girl who is never any better than she needs to be, and her friend Amelia who is much too good for her own good.Natasha Little is simply perfect as Becky. Little is the kind of woman that women find hard to like: delicately beautiful, exceptionally talented - making her perfect to play Becky. It is the subtle nuances in her moments that give her performance great depth and complexity - needed for accessibility for a selfish character who is the smartest person in any room she is in. Becky is a woman who would agree with the quote of another brilliant beauty, Hedy Lamar: Any woman can be glamourous. All she has to do is stand still and look stupid. Little's Beky is not as likable or vulnerable as Reese Witherspoon - who played Becky in a major motion picture film version made right around the same time - but with a miniseries we have time to understand her more. Besides, not many actresses are as likable as Witherspoon.As the story begins, this production does not look lavish, but the casting is so wonderful, the script so strong, the costumes simple but just right, that we are given the ability to focus on getting to know the people we will be following through 6 episodes.It is this initial simplicity that is the brilliance of the production design by Malcolm Thornton. In the early stages, poverty is cramped and messy; work is dark, cluttered and rotting, and wealth is clean, and bright and airy... like freedom. As we progress throught the story, wealth becomes more complex, overstuffed and overdecorated, echoing the complexity of the lives of Becky and Rawdon. Rawdon played by the handsome and overwhelmingly talented Nathaniel Parker (INSPECTOR LINLEY, BLEAK HOUSE).Breathtaking Andrew Davies, possibly the most brilliant adapter of the classics of all time, gifts us with a screenplay of grace and subtlety, weaving the ease of modern speech perfectly into the period action in a way that feels classic, but is totally accessible.It all bounces along to the ohm-pa-pa of a brass band. This band is one of the anachronistic touches of the production. While it passes as a military band, it also has a the raw, slightly under-rehearsed sound of a New Orleans jazz band, and sometimes a 1940s dancehall... meanwhile Becky's musical choices are straight from the pub... to the delight of the men around her. The band is really the only downfall of the production, in the moments of great serious importance, the band hits us over the head with a blaringly repetitive theme that gets very annoying after 6 episodes. It is the only wrong note in an otherwise witty and wise score. One of the nice subtle touches is that even Becky's singing, which at first seems flawless and delightful, begins to sound a bit flat in the episodes where we see dark results of her behavior on those around her.The music for Amelia and William is completely different. Plaintive melodies played as quietly as loyalty and love that things only of the good of the beloved. Philip Glenister as William carries the heart of the piece with affecting restraint. Miriam Margoles does her best work EVER here, and Jeremy Swift as Jos is absolutely delightful in every moment he is on screen!This entire miniseries is just marvelous, aspects of the production in tune with each other, in service to the whole piece.

17,A2NJO6YE954DBH,767019954,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 16]","Vanity Fair, first published serially in 1847-48, is William Makepeace Thackeray's tale of the fortunes of two women. On the one hand we have the ambitious and amoral Becky Sharp, the orphaned daughter of a struggling painter and a French opera singer, and on the other the passive Amelia Sedley, the wellborn but sheltered daughter of rich merchant. The two young women meet at Miss Pinkerton's Academy for young ladies, where Becky is a tutor of French and Amelia a student, and become friends. We then follow their intertwined lives as Jane tries to climb the social ladder and Amelia follows the dictates of her heart.Vanity Fair is celebrated for Thackeray's disparaging and negative portrait of the upper classes of early 19th-century England. The characters are rather vile, the relationships are hopelessly doomed, and readers who were not the targets of Thackeray's pen have enjoyed it ever since. Like others I watched this BBC mini-series version of Vanity Fair after watching the recent theatrical film from director Mira Nair with Reese Witherspoon as Becky Sharp. Ironically, Natasha Little, who plays Becky in this mini-series, plays Lady Jane Sheepshanks in the movie version. I was bothered by the decision to make Becky nicer, because stripped of her amorality the point of the character is lost. By the end of the first scene on the BBC version I knew that Little's Becky was indeed an amoral vixen. The problem is that she does not seem to be smart enough about it to really win our sympathies, and that results in us being detached from the story emotionally.Becky Sharp has long been considered the prototype for Margaret Mitchell's Scarlett O'Hara, which is an apt perspective in terms of the character's literary heritage. But whereas we root for Scarlett to save Tara, win Rhett, and overcome all her other obstacles, Becky goes her merry way without our really caring about her one way of the other. True, the subtitle for Vanity Fair is A Novel Without a Hero, but there is a sense of irony since the focus is primarily on the two young women, and all of the men are ultimately orbiting around them one way or the other. Still, even in such a social satire I want to at least enjoy the anti-heroine's progression, even if I find her unsympathetic (Shakespeare's Richard III is unsympathetic, and I find him fascinating).This mini-series was written by Andrew Davies and directed by Marc Munden, and the fault in Becky Sharp's characterization belongs more to them than it does Little's performance (Frances Grey plays Amelia). There is a scene early on where Becky impulsively decides to steal some things as she is sent packing, and I found myself thinking not so much that she was bold but that she was being stupid. What you have to remember is that Becky Sharp is disingenuous to one and all. The only point in the entire drama where I felt she was stripped to honest emotion and thoughts about anyone other than herself is when on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo her husband, Rawdon Crawley (Nathaniel Parker), otherwise known as her entrance into high society, is telling her what she needs to know if he does not come back. At that moment she has the good graces to pay attention, treat the matter seriously, and not let what might be her husband's last memory of her be anything other than honest concern for his safety.The script certainly is faithful to Thackeray's novel, but time and time again I found the acting to be a bit too formal, even given the conventions of the time and place (David Bradley as the Sir Pitt being the exception that proves the rule). Maybe I made a mistake watching the mini-series so soon after the theatrical film, because I tended to favor the performances in the latter, which is usually not the case when I am talking about a BBC version of a literary adaptation versus a theatrical release. Davies makes a major decision, understandable but still a major mistake from my perspective, in deciding to forgo a narrator, since that is the only way to get a lot of Thackeray's satire and wit into the proceedings. Since this is a BBC production so we are talking the same level of production standards we always expect to see from such period pieces.

Austen may deal out the occasional pin-prick, but her social comedy remains well-mannered and has a basic sweetness. Thackeray provides a far more brutal kind of satire; Vanity Fair, though nearly 200 years old, is a startlingly modern novel still. Rarely can a reader have been so hard put to find a single sympathetic character in a book. George Osborne is a heartless, vain opportunist; Jos Sedley a ridiculous coward; Amelia Sedley an insipid dreamer forever betting on the wrong horse; Dobbin on the other hand is just too good to be true and infuriatingly servile - et cetera. Only amidst such a cast are we tempted to feel a modicum of sympathy for viciously predatory Becky Sharp, who by modern standards would no doubt qualify as a psychopath. The tables only turn on her when she meets her equal in the vile lord Stayne (what's in a name), who warns her: Don't overplay your hand, Mrs. Crawley - you're in very deep now.... She does overplay her hand, and her astonishing social climb is mercilessly reversed. It's all very Darwinian avant-la-lettre: survival of the fittest.Andrew Davies perfectly caught on to this in his gritty, highly original adaptation of Vanity Fair for TV. Apart from Becky Sharp (Natasha Little) the cast includes no pleasant beauties of either sex to please the eye. Murkiness and squalor are not eschewed and find their peak at Queen's Crawley, where maggots indeed crawl on Lady Crawley's dinner plate, and Sir Pitt senior devours his tripe with relish. Though not all viewers may be pleased, the fact is that the conditions shown in this series are far more realistic depictions of actual living conditions in late 18th and early 19th century England than the glossed-over prettiness presented in most Austen-films. And still many of the actors have much better teeth than they would have had in those days...The acting is quite excellent throughout, and the intensity of it is heightened by frequent use of close-ups. At other times camera movements are deliberately unsteady, lending a documentary feel to Amelia's visit of George's grave, and making the viewer share in the drunkenness when Osborne senior waxes sentimental over young George at his dinner table. In dialog, the camera may well very slowly pan across the room, taking in all the little trinkets and ornaments it meets underway before finally arriving at the face of the other character. Instead of the perfectly choreographed quadrilles of Pride and Prejudice, you may find a dance at a ball depicted by a mere quick succession of close-ups of feet and whirling skirts. It is all rather unconventional and extremely effective. So is the music - the score is dominated by several deliciously raucous wind-band themes that tell us we are, indeed, in a fairground.The DVD comes without any extra's. I'm unsure to judge the picture quality, as I am playing the disc to a PAL TV and don't know if this causes distortions. Still it looked more than acceptable, except that pale faces tended to go slightly blue in outdoor scenes, and that dark images looked a bit as if filmed through a slightly sooty lens, and sometimes had unsteady backgrounds.Though in the final reckoning this series may not quite aspire to the perfection of the latest BBC Pride & Prejudice, it is at least as worthwhile and involving to watch, and makes a very refreshing change from the usual period drama routines.",5,"Gritty, highly original and compelling adaptation",1098576000,"10 24, 2004",0.1966

Natasha Little is fantastic as Becky Sharp, although at the end we are sort of left wondering if she is really good at heart, despite all her appearances of being selfish and uncaring, or if she helped Amelia get Amelia's guy for her (Becky's) own benefit.And Frances Grey is wonderful as Amelia Sedley, which leads to... William Dobbin. I don't know how he does it, but Philip Glenister just played that part perfectly. Here's why: When he is first introduced, I looked at him and thought, Ew, why does he keep looking at Amelia that way? He's not even that good looking! And hoped wildly that he would not stay in the story. But by the end, he was completely embedded in my mind as THE ONLY guy for A, and suddenly he seemed amzingly attractive.

Halloran,"[110, 111]","Thackeray's &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is such a sprawling, grand example of the Victorian novel that any mere two-hour movie adaptation will be forced to leave out crucial elements. As it is, this six-hour BBC film version emits certain items (Jos Sedley's ultimate fate, the James Crawley episode), but is remarkably faithful to its source. Indeed, a television mini-series is the best way to adapt such a work, allowing the story to unfold and the viewer to become involved with the various characters.This production is fantastic, with beautiful costumes, excellent performances, and a fine script. Chief among its attractions is Natasha Little in the key role of Becky Sharp. Miss Little is not only luminously beautiful, but manages to arouse our sympathies toward a virtually unsympathetic character. Special mention must also go to Jeremy Swift, whose portrayal of bumbling Jos Sedley is a delight. Miriam Margolyes (always wonderful) and Eleanor Bron appear in secondary roles. The rest of the cast is well-chosen and all play their parts with conviction.The greatest hurdle a filmed version of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; faces is how to convey the many shifts of tone which Thackeray goes through in the novel. This problem has been solved by use of an unusual score, which draws from such diverse sources as military marching bands, Strauss waltzes (wrong for the period but who cares?), and a bit of Kurt Weill. Murray Gold's score never lets us forget that we are in the world of Thackeray's biting satire, and not Jane Austen's more delicate world of comedy-of-manners.All told, it will take a long time before this film treatment is bettered.",5,Excellent adaptation of Thackeray masterpiece,948931200,"01 27, 2000",0.447

You don't often get a heroin who you struggle to like, but this Becky is coniving, and a bad mother-- qualities that get sugar coated in Reese Witherspoon's version.

I remember seeing a BBC version with Susan Hampshire in the role of Becky Sharp back in the 1970s, as well as the 1930s Hollywood version with Mariam Hopkins on late-night television when I was a teenager. Now I understand that there is to be another Hollywood version, with Reese Witherspoon, of all the odd choices, to play Becky. Natasha Little is, in my opinion, an outstanding Becky Sharp, surpassing both Hampshire and Hopkins in the role. I cannot feature the vastly overrated Ms Witherspoon being able to give as subtle and natural a performance as Ms Little does in this A&amp;E production. Ms Little is at once appealing and a monster, a woman &quot;on the make&quot;; in one very funny, and creepy, bit she is forced to turn down a marriage proposal from the coarse Sir Pitt Crawley, because she is already married to his dashing son. When Pitt Crawley leaves the room, it becomes clear that Becky would have married the vulgar old man for the security he offered had she been free.The rest of the cast was very good, particularly the actors portraying Amelia, George, Rawdon, and Dobbin. There has been some criticism of the appearance of the actors, that they were too plain or even downright unattractive for the roles. One of the differences between British and American productions (particularly those made for televsion) is that in British productions the performers are more often selected for their talent than their appearance. Sometimes this backfires, as in the case of the remake of &quot;The Forsyte Saga,&quot; when many viewers complained about Geena McKee being too plain for the role of Irene Forsyte, who was supposed to be a great beauty. In the case of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; I feel that the actors were just right for their roles in every way, including appearance. Becky's attraction was her spirit as much as her face, and Amelia's sweetness was the inspiration for the love and admiration she received from men.My one criticism of the film was the loud background music. It was supposed to suggest a carnival or fair, but it was so blasted loud that at times it drowned out the performers. Although this was not as constant as one reviewer indicated, it did happen often enough to be annoying.

While reading Thackeray's novel, I've also been able to watch the six part BBC serialization starring Natasha Little as Becky Sharp. I'll comment on this BBC serial later--but first to the novel itself.Well, it's a very good novel. Certainly one of the best from the Victorian period which it parodies so beautifully. Becky Sharp is a fine literary creation and the personal embodiment of that Vanity Fair which Thackeray, on the one hand, appears to despise so much, while winking at us in happy glee and suggesting it ain't such a bad place after all (by gad!)on the other. All the main characters are fully realized and mercilessly exposed in their weaknesses by the unrelenting author.Becky, as I have said, is the very embodiment of the superficial, and finally worthless, attractions on offer in the pitiless and unrelenting world of Vanity Fair which raises people up for a moment, only to mercilessly crush them forever after they have strutted for their little pompous moment on the high society stage. Amelia's Major Dobbin is the only really honourable character in the book--and he is continually trampled over by all the bright young things who want to make their momentary splash in Vanity Fair. Thackeray describes him as a spooney and, indeed, he spends most of the novel as Amelia's platonic lover who dare not ask for more than the little she will give him. Becky Sharp is the real hero, heroine or anti-heroine of this novel without a hero. She manipulates everyone with the most perfect judgement and lives for the joy of Vanity Fair's thousand intrigues. Her husband Rawdon's unexpected escape from a debtor's house and subsequent discovery of his wife making love to the Marquis of Steyne (and his resultant thrashing of that gentleman) is probably the most dramatic moment in the book. However, Becky--if not her husband or the Marquis--is able to move beyond even this catastrophe.Vanity Fair is not without faults for the modern reader. Sometimes Thackeray indulges in page after page of almost nonsensical parody of the contemporary society of his day and this comes across (in the 21st century) as even worse than Swift's most obscure rants in Gulliver's Travels on the Tory/Whig politics of his time. Thankfully, Thackeray doesn't usually detain his reader long in such tedious environs, but soon gets his marvellously readable story moving again.As I wrote earlier, I have been watching the 1998 BBC adaptation of Vanity Fair while actually reading the novel itself--and it's been quite a revealing experience. Of course, one sympathises with the person responsible for making the adaptation. How is it possible to condense the action of more than 800 pages into a 6 hour serial? No doubt it's an impossible task, but I was, mostly, impressed with the beeb's minor success. The adaptation is well done, though it's not without blemish and, most notably, substitutes some of Thackeray's prejudices for several of our own time. For example,(in the novel) Becky's husband, Rawdon, thrashes Lord Steyne with his open hand to make the point that he regards him as a coward and expects to be satisfied in a duel. The beeb substituted a drunken head-butt for this subtle assault--presumably because they thought this was more acceptable to late 20th century British yob culture. Again, the serialization accurately includes a black manservant in the Sedley family. However, he (the black manservant) is given a far larger part in the adaptation than in Thackeray's novel (where, indeed, he is hardly more than a wretched slave). Wouldn't it have been better to simply cut this character out altogether rather than have him purposelessly wandering through (seemingly) every episode full of a somewhat threatening joie de vivre? Nevertheless, as I wrote earlier, the adaptation is probably ALMOST as good as it could have been in the circumstances. In particular, Natasha Little is quite enchanting as Rebecca Sharp.",4,"The BBC Vanity Fair, 1998",1250208000,"08 14, 2009",0.3383
