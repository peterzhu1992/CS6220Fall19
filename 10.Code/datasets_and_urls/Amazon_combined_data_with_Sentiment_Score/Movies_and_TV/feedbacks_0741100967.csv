This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you are looking for a good old time you may enjoy this one.",4,The first in a long list of medical dramas,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",0.441
1,A2EY9SKZCKJ3W7,741100967,Joseph Barba,"[4, 4]","Medic is an example of a golden age of TV that was primitive, yet packed with powerful drama and characters. No tricks, just classic drama, and all in a living, faded, black and white picture. Medic's gripping stories sometimes leave you with a heavy heart because the world of medicine does not always lead to a happy ending. These are real stories about real people suffering the real slings and arrows of outrageous fortune one moment and the miracles of gut-wrenching medical procedures the next. Richard Boone shows the great talent that was to develop in later years. He died too soon at sixty-three. For me, Victor Young's Medic Theme will always be one of my favorite screen melodies. Powerful stuff and worthy of the drama it underscores with soaring beauty. Add Medic to your library to learn how much sincere artists achieved with so little. As Shakespeare said: The play's the thing.... With Medic you don't need or miss special effects. Even today's sophisticated viewers, escept for the truly jaded, will enjoy most of these episodes. Recommended highly!",5,Medic revisited,1343520000,"07 29, 2012",0.3192

3,A3E3HHHYYX4AMS,741100967,Mike,"[10, 10]","Medic.This series I bought sight unseen because of Richard Boone.I then found out it was created by James E Moser who would later go on to create Ben Casey.I really liked that show.It was my favourite medical show of all.There was 59 episodes made but Timeless Media Group have managed to get their hands on only 44 episodes.This is a great series,gripping ,harrowing,enlightning,entertaining and realistic as most of the shows are taken from actual files.What this series does is go into detail about the patients and the ailments and procedures.It plays almost like a documentary.It may feel a bit static as this was early TV and there were limited camera movements and sets.But actual operations on camera as well making us think about how our organs work so hard inside us to keep us living is amazing.There are a few young actors in it that would go onto greater things and become household names like John Saxon,Dennis Hopper to name two.This series shows how things have changed as in one episode that starred Lee J Cobb which deals with electric-shock treatment which we now know has been banned from practice.There are some flecks and specs on the film but that did not upset my viewing pleasure.A great series in my opinion.Thanks Timeless Media Group for releasing this DVD.",5,Before Ben Casey there was......,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",0.975
4,A2EWN4ANV3CPG6,741100967,Paul Sayles,"[21, 21]",Richard Boone is both narrator and participant in some of these episodes. The historical background given by Boone in the opening scenes is brief and to the point so that you can be taken to the scene of the action quickly and efficiently.This series is a fine snapshot of medical practices of the 1950s which might seem outmoded now. Electro-convulsive therapy is shown as a treatment practice in the '50s. The effects of a nuclear bomb explosion are graphic and chilling to watch and listen to. The open heart valve replacement is quite intriguing even in black and white. Overall this is a series that while it might seem to be somewhat dated is good for historical background and comparison with the way medicine is practiced now.Growing up in the 1950s this was the state of medicine as I knew it and it seemed pretty impressive. I recommend this to anyone with an interest in medical history.,5,Excellent depiction of medical practices of the 1950s,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",0.1725
