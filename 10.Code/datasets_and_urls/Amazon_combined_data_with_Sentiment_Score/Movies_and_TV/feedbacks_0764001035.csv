0,AUDWCQXIG0QZG,764001035,abettertomorrow,"[0, 0]","In this direct sequel to the superior Mothra vs. Godzilla, a meteorite slams into earth and unleashes Ghidorah, the flying three-headed dragon whose sole purpose in life is to lay waste to civilizations. Godzilla and Rodan, who first emerge as villains, are persuaded by one of Mothra's offspring to join together to defeat the monster save the planet.The film is generally considered part of the Golden Era of Toho, as it was helmed by director Ishiro Honda, special effects extraordinaire Eiji Tsuburaya, and composer Akira Ifukube. They all do decent work here, but much of it is undone by the film's comedic elements. For the first time in the Godzilla series, many of the kaiju scenes are played for laughs. Godzilla does not fight the way a giant dinosaurian animal would; he fights like a human being, and this brings the film down, as the suitmation becomes painfully obvious. Unfortunately, this anthropromorphism of Godzilla would continue throughout the rest of the Showa era before Toho decided to get serious again with Godzilla 1985.Despite its shortcomings, Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster is a good entry in the series, and stands head and shoulders above most of the rest of the Showa films that followed. With good effects, likable characters, and a fun espionage subplot, Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster offers good fun for kaiju fans.",3,"Colorful and fun, but flawed",1262390400,"01 2, 2010",0.2782

This is the first release, in the US, of the unedited Japanese version. For competists, the strangely reedited US version has also been included. Both versions are entertaining.This is the first time team up of Godzilla, Rodan and Mothra against the alien dragon King Ghidorah (aka Ghidrah). Along for the ride are the twin faeries fromMothra's island who, telepathically orchestrate the colaboration. There is also a amnesiac Himalayan princess who is also a cross dressing Martian prophetess; three Blues Brothers look-alike assasins who are out tofinish her off and a tough police detective who wants to save her and his sister who wants to restore her memory. Basically, it tries to play like a Hitchcock thriller or an early Bond film. In the end the espianage plotand the monster plot come together. This is the first time that Godzilla swithches from menace to hero.The first half of the film is basically GODZILLA VS. RODAN, with the two bad monsters convinced to turn good by the intelligent and telepathic Mothra. The following film MONSTER ZERO is basically a direct sequel to this with Godzilla and Rodan reteaming to fight Ghidorah in the futuristic (at the time at least) 1980s.These are the GODZILLA titles not yet available on DVD, and that have no current release dates:GODZILLA VS.

GHIDORAH, THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER gives birth to Godzilla's most iconic foe, the great King Ghidorah! Ghidorah is a masterwork of design and special effects, brought to life by a team of puppeteers controlling the dragon's vast wings and many heads. Ghidorah's signature roar and lightning breath only add to the monster's incredible appeal, making him a favorite amongst fans. GHIDORAH, THE THREE-HEADED MONSTER introduces many important trends that would come to define the Showa era, mainly the inclusion of alien beings and the all-out brawls that would feature a pantheon of Toho's greatest creations. We also see a change in Godzilla's role from destructor to indifferent observer as part of his gradual shift into humanity's savior continues. GHIDORAH contains a fantastic display of aerial combat, grappling, and laser battles that reaches the height of Eiji Tsuburaya's incredible achievement in special effects.

I love the story line to the movie, a princess who's uncle wants to kill her is coming to japan for safety, when she jumps off an airplane they think she is dead but she comes back controlled by the Venus people(or martians in the american version) and she predicts the return of Godzilla, and Rodan, and pretty much most of the movie is Godzilla vs. Rodan. But then King Ghidorah comes, who she tells destroyed her home world, and Godzilla Rodan and Mothra team up. I loved how they re-used the original Mothra Vs. Godzilla suit, it was my favorite from the showa era suit. But this movie isn't all perfect, i didn't like how the godzilla theme from this movie was mashed with rodans and was used for the rest of the movie.

On the plus side is the eponymous creation. Ghidrah (or Ghidorah or King Ghidorah, as he..she. whatever, is known) is an inspired and unique creation&iexcl; 3 heads&iexcl; 2 tails...it is a triumph of design and execution and a truly striking creation. Godzilla returns looking only slightly different that in his prior film. The look of the film...the music and color are all top notch. However, the story is a rather convoluted mess, with ideas introduced, and then abandoned, and the introduction of such ideas as the monsters talking and slapstick fights are a clear indication of the downward direction the Godzilla series was taking. Rodan is seen here for the first time since the 1957 original, has been re designed, and looks quite bad, with Glassy eyes, a long bobbing neck and clumsy movements.

This one is done by David Kalat..Author of the excellent McFarland book on the Godzilla series. Its a strikingly different commentary that the other releases. Where the commentaries on the other dvds were fawningly informative, but dry to the point of numbing, Kalats commentary is rapid fire, informative and extremely enthusiastic, conveying his obvious love for the genre and this film. Some might find his approach too rapid and enthusiastic, but I found it great fun&iexcl;Kmore like a talk with a fellow fan than a dull presentation of names and dates. His main thrust is also to defend the shift to a more childlike&iexcl;Kor childish approach to the films and the advantages of the dubbed versions.

This film marks the start of Godzilla's transition from villain to anti-hero to hero and introduces his greatest foe; the three headed space dragon King Ghidorah. A fairly good film that has finally be released on DVD. Like the others this DVD contains both the original unedited, undubbed Japanese version and the Americanized version.Unlike Mothra vs. Godzilla, the quality of the American print is on par with the Japanese one, unfortunately it's not as good as Mothra vs. Godzilla. At times the picture quality is good but at other times the colours are faded and the print has scratches and hairs. The audio quality is fairly decent, keep in mind it's in its original mono soundtrack.The special features are decent though slim. It has the Japanese trailer but it isn't subtitled so unless you speak/read Japanese you won't understand it. The image galleries are nice with some good background info on the monsters and the movie but personally, I miss the poster slide show they had on Mothra vs. Godzilla.The biggest special feature is the audio commentary on the English dubbed version by David Kalat. I've seen some reviews that criticize these commentaries as fan boys gushing about how much they love these movies but that's not a fair description. David Kalat makes it clear how much he loves the movie, but he still shares some interesting behind the scenes tidbits on the film and the Godzilla franchise in general. If anything he's guilty of letting his inner child out, and really who can blame him for that.

Not two, not three, but four, FOUR giant monsters causing mayhem on the mist-shrouded island of Nippon, this movie was an addiction in my childhood - if it was on TV, I was sitting there a foot away from the screen. In my college years, this was one of my favorite go-to's for unintentional comedy, but it was also educational in that regard - why DID I like it so much, I was forced to ask. After all, there were tons of movies out there with worse special effects (GTTHM has pretty terrific fx work for its day...or almost any day), even goofier dubbing (hell, the dubbing for this one was actually pretty good), trainwreck scripts (the script was fairly solid, really) that I wouldn't think of watching twice, let alone dozens of times...the more I thought about it, it wasn't bad at all. Maybe goofy, but underneath the latex monster suits, crumbling miniature cities, and the begged questions about monster insurance rates in Japan, there was something that made this one special, beyond childhood nostalgia. There was something magical about a good Godzilla movie, and for me this was the cream of the crop.Eventually I came to realize that the classic Showa-era tokusatsu films from Toho had a heart, a craftsmanship, which made them magical. GTTHM is among the best of the Godzilla films, even with its spies and assassins, silly plot contrivances, and formulaic monster-brawl trappings.On this DVD you get both the original Japanese release, and the US theatrical version. Getting the chance to see these films in their original language (and aspect ratio!) has been a real eye-opener. It's a bit like a restored piece of fine antique furniture - you knew it was good stuff, but that crappy paint job wasn't doing it any favors. In terms of rating, I haven't seen one of these classic Toho movies that hasn't gone up at least a star in my estimation upon seeing it in the original Japanese.I almost prefer the English version, in terms of the edit - it trims just a little fat and actually gives a better shape to the narrative in a few key aspects. But, in the English dub you lose out on some of Ifukube's great score as well as the movie's intentional entertainment value. On the other hand, the English dub gives you the immortal line Godzilla! What terrible language! It's something of a toss up between the two versions, so we're fortunate to get both. The commentary is a pleasure, as well. The other extras are ok, nothing mind-blowing. If you want your mind blown, just pause it every time star Akiko Wakabayashi is on-screen. It's ladies like her that make boys grow up all into Asian chicks.There's a certain subset of fandom that doesn't like this movie because this is where Godzilla stopped being a one-dimensional city-crushing, humanity-stomping machine and developed a personality. People who hate fun only have my sympathy, and I hope they feel better soon.If you could only own a handful of Godzilla movies, this would have to be one, if for no other reason than the introduction of the absolutely great King Ghidorah.

14,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,764001035,David Girod,"[1, 2]","Ghidorah: The Three Headed Monster, while not my favorite Toho release, is pretty important to the Godzilla legacy overall. This is the film that introduced Ghidorah to the series, this is also the first film that shows Godzilla fighting for humanity instead of against it. But to be honest, I find this entry pretty weak overall.It's no secret that Godzilla flicks aren't about developing characters, but Ghidorah takes that to the extreme. We are introduced to several groups of humans fairly quickly; a reporter, her brother the policeman, a group of scientists, a missing princess turned Martian, some dedicated assassins, a world famous psychiatrist, some scientists reaching out to saucer people....so many people introduced in such a rapid fire way that it gets confusing as to who is doing what and why. To top it off, they have so many human characters here, that the monsters get limited screen time.The basic story is that a policeman is assigned to protect a princess flying into Japan. Her plane explodes en-route and she is believed dead. But a day later a woman that looks like the princess is found in a nearby park prophesizing about mankinds doom. Is it the princess, is she a Martian or simply insane?While all this is going on Godzilla and Rodan are fighting around the island, and things get kicked up a notch when Ghidorah shows up as well. The only hope for mankind is Mothra. The only problem is Mothra is still a baby larva and looks more like a Jimmy Dean sausage link than a butt kicking monster.The fight scenes here a pretty weak. Rodan is like a giant mutated chicken-bat and his only offense is to peck or create a strong wind using his wings. Ghidorah looks great and comes off like a real threat, but his screen time is very limited (you would think he would get more screentime in a film that bears his name?), and Mothra is basically a slug who spits web and can bite a tail now and again. Godzilla has to shoulder most of the fighting here, but he seems to have lost some serious IQ points since the last film as his greatest offensive weapon in the film is to bend over and smack at things with the tip of his tail? Sure, it's not as goofy as that dropkick in Megalon...but it's pretty close.As a fan of Godzilla, this film was a must own for me.

The key connecting the two stories is that the princess is being posessed by the spirits of ancestors from Venus or Mars. (The Japanese version says Venus. The dubbed English version says Mars.) These ancestors have the ability to foretell the future, thus she is capable of foretelling the return of Godzilla and the re-awakening of Rodan, as well as the arrival of a new monster called King Ghidorah. (Nobody says what kingdom he rules.) Ghidorah was responsible for the distruction of all life on Venus/mars over 3,000 years ago. The survivors landed in the Himalyas, intermarried with humans, and lost their powers until restored by the approach of Ghidorah.Meanwhile the assasins have located the princess and make attempts to kill her. These attempts continue throughout the movie until the assasins are killed by a landslide during the battle of the monsters.Meanwhile, Godzilla has come ashore on Japan and found Rodan already in occupation. It's hate at first sight between these two and they commence a fight. As the fight goes on, a huge meteorite breaks open and Ghidorah appears out of a ball of fire.At this point, everyone turns to the twin fairies from Mothra's island to call for Mothra to come to their aid. The old Mothra has died, but her caterpiller comes to do what he can. First he tries to persuade Rodan and Godzilla to join him in the fight against Ghidorah, but they refuse. Mothra then sets out to fight Ghidorah alone. Since Mothra is still quite young, Ghidorah is beating him when Godzilla and Rodan have a change of heart and join in to drive off Ghidorah, who flies off to seek easier prey.due to a blow to her head in the final battle against the assasins, the princess returns to her homeland.This film marks the turning point in the Godzilla series. In the end, Godzilla is no longer a destructive monster and has become a defender of the Earth if not of humanity. Also, the movies become directed more to the juvenile audience.On the whole, this is not, in my opinion, the best of the Godzilla series, but I would place it in second place behind the first one. Because of the complex plot and excellent special effects, it is well worth having in my collection.",4,a spy movie with four monsters,1183593600,"07 5, 2007",-0.0963

26,A25TBLCXTU4NKY,764001035,Gman,"[1, 1]","Highly anticipated, as this would mark the first time the movie would be legitimately released on region 1, Classic Media has done a fairly nice job with this release of King Ghidorah's introductory picture. Boasting good video and audio quality, and a decent selection of extras, the overall package does well to overshadow some of its more minor problems in those three areas.Although not perfect, Classic Media has done a respectable job with the video tracks here, especially considering that they were both sandwiched on a single disc. Of the two, the track for the Japanese version is clearly the superior one. It has some minor problems, such as a constant small number of speckles and some rough, in terms of print damage, transitions; however, the movie also looks fairly sharp, with a nice amount of detail and a very low amount of grain through out. The colors are also distinct, although there is a very slight brown and yellow tint to some of the scenes, which was a common mishap on many of Toho's early region 2 DVD releases, which is likely the source of this track. The overall brightness does appear to be set too high, though, as it does drown out the details in a few scenes, although its far from a major problem.As for the US version, it again gets mixed results, although it's a clear step in the right direction compared to what was available on the company's releases of Godzilla Raids Again and Mothra vs. Godzilla for their respective US cuts. Once again, it appears that Classic Media didn't have a great source for this version, as can be seen from a very murky looking opening credit sequence. Rather than just settling for a clearly poor print, though, the company actually used the Japanese source already available on this release for the rest of the feature. Now I recently gave flack to another company for doing this same practice, which was Tokyo Shock for Frankenstein Conquers the World. However, that release contained additional footage, which made replacing the US version cumbersome, while Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster has no such problem. As many know, though, Continental, who released the film in the US, did a lot of editing, moving sequences and generally tightening up the pacing. To Classic Media's credit, they have done a near flawless job in matching this editing with Toho's restored footage, ending up with a pretty satisfying final product. They also revert to their source for the US cut during any scenes that feature something different, such as the opening titles and The End.As for a direct comparison, they unfortunately highlight some problems introduced in the US version found on this release:As is apparent, the US version looks very soft in contrast, losing a lot of the detail available in the Japanese cut. This is a sad byproduct of lots of compression being applied to the source, which was inevitable considering how much the company tried to place on a single DVD. What isn't so apparent is that the aspect ratio is ever so slightly smaller than the original 2.35:1 found in the Japanese cut. The discrepancy is so small, though, that it's more of just something to note than be upset about.The DVD features two mono audio tracks with one in Japanese and the other dubbed into English, and both attached to their respective versions of the production. In terms of the quality, the Japanese audio track sounds good, as its devoid of any type of obvious flaws. There isn't anything particularly remarkable about it, but it maintains the movie's original audio presentation and all of the dialogue sounds clear.The English track, though, is lacking in some regards. First off, there is a slight skip in the audio from the transition of the Toho Scope logo to the Ghidrah title screen. The audio in general has some faults too, as the quality dips in some parts, with even Godzilla's roar sounding a little muffled on occasion. It's generally serviceable though, and everything about the audio, including the additional stock music that was added in, is included. The soundtrack, though, does sound a little warped at times, in particular during the opening titles, and especially during the final sequence where it sounds simply wretched for a few moments.The Japanese version can be accompanied with, removable, English subtitles.This disc mimics the content found on the company's previous two Godzilla DVDs, while also making some slight improvements to the formula. Once again, this release does include a small documentary, this time on the life of special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya. This feature is once again done by Ed Godziszewski, who is still a little dry in his presentation, but provides a wealth of information while the feature also presents a number of excellent production stills and private photographs of Tsuburaya.Following this is a Poster Slide Show. This DVD improves on previous releases, though, in not tying this feature to a video track. Instead, the posters are now viewable as a selection of images that can be moved through with the remote. This allows for the viewer to take their time with the pictures, while background information is also provided on each screen. This general formula is repeated for a new feature as well that focuses on black and white production stills from the movie. The release also contains the movie's original trailer, preserved in its 2.35:1 aspect ratio.Now the last feature on the disc is an audio commentary track for the US version done by author David Kalat. Unfortunately, to be brutally honest, I found myself mostly unsatisfied with Kalat's commentary. On the plus side, he knows his stuff, providing a lot of great information, with only a few minor slip ups. The slip ups are also fairly common mistakes, usually attached to every or always types of remarks that make for easy pitfalls. For example, stating that the birth scene of King Ghidorah would be recycled pretty much every time the three-headed monster reappears in future movies, while the scene in question would only ever be used again briefly in Destroy All Monsters (1968) on a monitor. Errors like these are small and easy to overlook. Sadly, the fault of this commentary mainly falls in the delivery. On one hand, Kalat clearly sounds enthusiastic, adding a sense of energy in his delivery. Unfortunately, he goes way overboard in this respect, rushing his overall speech while also placing emphasis on sometimes peculiar words. His biggest sin, though, is simply his love of digression, which is best summed up in a word for word quote from the commentary:Now what of King Kong vs. Godzilla? Ya know, it's kind of too bad that film wasn't a part of this package from Classic Media because it really could used a commentary track to go through the tortuous, complex labyrinth that was its root from concept to screen. I'll digress to give some high points here, cause, ya know, I feel like it. Keep in mind that this digression also comes on the heels of a lengthy summary of the influence of the original 1933 King Kong, primarily focusing on its impact in the United States. To be fair, Kalat is a fountain of information, but his talent doesn't seem to lend itself well to the commentary track format, as too infrequently does he connect his information with what's happening on screen.Bottom line, Classic Media is improving, and have certainly come a long way from their emergence on the scene with their 2002 releases. Suffice to say, this DVD, despite its minor faults, more than merits a purchase from fans of the King of the Monsters, especially at it's fairly easy to swallow price tag.",3,"Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",0.158

30,A2SRP2HP75CUVD,764001035,Horror-Fanatics.com,"[2, 2]","Ghidorah, the Three Headed Monster is the 5th film in Toho's Godzilla series. Earlier that year Toho released Mothra Vs. Godzilla, which is one of my favorite films in the long running series of giant monster movies. Ghidorah, the Three Headed Monster is an interesting follow up. Not only was it a rushed film considering that Mothra Vs. Godzilla played during spring time of the same year, but it's the first monster movie to feature Godzilla as a good guy. From the start Godzilla was seen as a notorious monster who scared the entire population of Tokyo. He's stomped through cities battling other giant monsters that got in his way. Godzilla was finally defeated by the peaceful Mothra in the fourth installment of the series. Luckily, Godzilla's reign of terror didn't stop there. In this film, Ghidorah, Godzilla teams up with other monsters to defend planet earth from a terrible extraterrestrial threat. I could go on and on about this movie, because there's just so much t say. But I'll try to make this review short and simple.I have a feeling that it's going to get a little long. The movie takes place shortly after the events in Mothra Vs. Godzilla. After an assassination attempt, a princess from Selgina (a small Himalayan country) becomes possessed by the spirit of a Venusian and escapes a plane just as it explodes. As this happens a meteorite falls from the sky and lands on earth. Little do the people of earth know, inside of the meteorite is King Ghidorah, the monster responsible for planet Venus' destruction. After the meteor shower, Godzilla and Rodan emerge from hibernation and not only attack Japan, but each other. The battle rages on while the two wreck cities and try to destroy one another. Meanwhile, the media becomes fascinated with the woman who claims that she's a profit from Venus. She warns the people that the planet is doomed and that it will be destroyed. This catches the attention of both the media and the mob that's planning to kill the princess from Selgina.Later, the space monster known as Ghidorah awakes from its slumber and flies on to destroy everything in its path. When there seems to be no hope, the twin priestesses from Infant island decide to ask Mothra for help. That's when Mothra and the tiny twins attempt to convince Godzilla and Rodan to stop their fighting and focus on the new threat, Ghidorah. It's important for me to see a good story. You can have the best action and special effects in the world, but if the story isn't good, then the movie isn't good either. Luckily, I found the story in Ghidorah to be quite amazing. As I mentioned earlier, Ghidorah is one of the last Godzilla movies to be tampered with. Previously some of the earlier Godzilla films were cut to reduce the violence among other things. The American release of Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster runs in at 84 minutes. For the US release scenes that didn't really drive the story were taken out, as well as the scenes that carried humor.Luckily the cuts aren't all that bad, in way it's good because in the American version of the movie you actually get to see the monster Ghidorah earlier. Plus some of the cuts were to fix a continuity error. So the American cut isn't bad at all; In fact a lot of Godzilla fans prefer the American cut over the original Japanese version of Ghidorah. This film is very popular amongst fans and critics. Ghidorah is one of the first monster movies to feature the actual monsters solving human problems. Ghidorah carries a James Bond-style that sets up the mood with the film's characters. It's also the first time we get to see Godzilla as a hero instead of a ruthless monster. Godzilla took on the heroic persona he would wear for the remainder of the series. Ghidorah is also the first Godzilla film to not feature military weapons such as tanks and jets (very interesting). Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster is the first movie to feature Rodan, the flying monster who appeared in his own film in 1956.This movie was also the first to feature the space monster Ghidorah, who would later be Godzilla's most frequently recurring opponent. Ghidorah the Three Headed Monster is one of the better films in the Godzilla series. Not only is it a great story, but it's remarkably entertaining. The action is great, the acting is good and the ending is definitely pleasing. The bonus features on this DVD are a little slim compared to the other Toho Collection DVDs. It features the usual trailers and still photos, but the best part of the DVD is the audio commentary by David Kalat, author of 'A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series'. Kalat provides excellent commentary by giving you a history lesson on not only the film, but on the folks behind Toho studios. You'll feel a lot smarter after listening to the commentary on the American version of the movie. All in all this is a great watch. If you're looking to build up on your Godzilla collection then you have to buy this DVD.

The print itself is disgusting, probably more so than anything Power Multimedia have ever released. The colours are under-saturated to the point of looking black and white, the image occasionally warps, the image is abundant with scratches, hairs, tears and other such blemishes. The high amount of artifacting didn't help it much either. While trying to be as fair as I can with this review, I honestly can't find any redeeming qualities with this release.AUDIO QUALITY:The disc only contains one audio option, the English dub. Although encoded as 5.1, all it is doing is putting the exact same stream through every channel. Basically it's mono, which just happens to be coming out of all your speakers. The whole film is plagued with constant hissing and some frequent popping. It's not flat out terrible, but it's far from good.EXTRA FEATURES:Seriously, what did you expect?OVERALL:The first thing I noticed upon opening the Amazon box was the cover, which is printed on standard printer paper. They must have been running low on ink when printing my copy, since it's covered with vertical lines. The cover itself wasn't cut to fit properly, with odd white borders around the image and stuffed in the case at the wrong angle. The cover art looks very crude, and the name Ghidrah was also misspelled as Ghidra. The disc itself has a cheap home made label, and I noticed the ink had smudged around the edges. Upon playing the disc there is a very cheesy splash screen which aids the ego of the mysterious John Matarazzo, who also had his name listed as the films director for a short time on Amazon, and credits himself for DVD Design and Creation and Realization on the cover. When I tried booting the disc in my DVD player, no luck - rejected. When I tried in the player in my room it loaded, however the film was constantly jumping and jittering. In the end I tested it in my DVD-ROM, which seemed to play fine. Why is this? Probably because it's a badly encoded DVD-R. That correct, DVD-R, even more obvious since the bottom of the disc is purple, whereas legitimate discs are silver or gold (single and double layered respectively). Finally, CineVu don't own the copyright to Ghidrah The Three Headed Monster, or Ghidra The Three Headed Monster should I say. Not only is this disc a bootleg, but it's a bad bootleg. You would have thought since they are breaching copyright anyway that they would have used Toho's Region-2 DVD as a source and subtitled it, but alas it was much easier for them to mass produce this garbage. What's the worst of it all? The disc costs $20. If you've got any wits about you, you'll stay away from this release.",1,CineVu Release,1082937600,"04 26, 2004",-0.0734

50,A2NJO6YE954DBH,764001035,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[5, 5]","Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster (San daikaij: Chikyu saidai no kessen, which literally translated as Earth's Greatest Battle in case you were wondering) is one of the better Godzilla movies, simply because this 1964 film has the three-headed monster named Ghidrah. It also has the Twin Fairies (Emi and Ymi Ito), known as the Shobijin in Japan, the little friends of Mothra, which is a clear sign that this is one of those movies where Godzilla is now the good monster instead of the bad monster. He was clear a bad monster in the original Gojira in 1954 and the following year in Gojira no gyakush. In 1964's Mosura tai Gojira he was still bad, while Mothra was clearly good, while in the 1962 film Kingukongu tai Gojira it depended on what side of the Pacific you lived on. By the 1970s Godzilla was definitely a good monster, and that transition starts right here.However, Gozilla's redemption is not clear a half-hour into the film when the monsters start showing up because the first time we seen Godzilla he is destroying an ocean liner. Then Rhodan breaks out of the volcano at Mt. Aso and the two of them start having one of their standard fights when Ghidrah shows up on earth, courtesy of a meteor that lands in Korobe Gorge. Basically what happens at that point is that Mothra convinces the two earth monsters to stop fighting each other and the trio go off to fight Ghidrah. Clearly if you have a three-headed monster then you need three monsters, one for each head, so you can have three times the fun, although Godzilla is at something of a disadvantage since he is the only one of this quartet that cannot fly. But screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa can work around that problem, have no fear. After all this is the guy who wrote the scripts for Mosura tai Gojira, Kaij daisenso, and most of the other Japanese monster movies of the 1960s.Oh, yes, there are also some actual human beings running around in Ghidrah, such as Professor Miura (Hiroshi Koizumi), Mas Selina Salno, Princess of Sergina (Akiko Wakabayashi), and a Chief Assassin (Hisaya Ito). In fact, the humans are the only ones running around in the first part of the film with all sorts of subplots that are really not going to have much to do with the sudden arrival of a three-headed monster on Earth. Maybe the whole attempt to assassinate the princess consists of pages from an unsold script that were tossed into this one because you can only have people in rubber suits playing monsters so long before they need a respite. Besides, there are four monsters, count them, and mere humans cannot compete with that, even with the Twin Fairies appearing on Japanese television. Ghidrah is really the star of this one because not only does he have three heads, he shoots lightning bolts out of his mouths and makes a neat monster sound. The fact he has no arms gives him a real distinctive look, but since he has three heads you tend not to notice what is missing because the additional stuff is so captivating. No wonder he and Godzilla duke it out in five more films, although none of them have all that this first one has going for it.This film was also known as The Biggest Battle on Earth, The Biggest Fight on Earth, The Greatest Battle on Earth, The Greatest Fight on Earth, Three Giant Monsters: The Earth's Greatest Decisive Battle, Monster of Monsters, and just plain Ghidrah (I have to admit I sort of miss the old days when studios tried to trick you into seeing the same B-movie more than once by giving it another name). Whatever the title this is a favorite for kids because it offers more monsters and more Tokyo stomping that your average Godzilla film. Interestingly enough, in the Japanese version it is Venus that was destroyed by Ghidrah, but in the American version this is changed to Mars (as is the home of the alien possessing the princess). Just remember, the Japanese version is from Venus, the American version from Mars...",4,"Godzilla, Rhodan and Mothra take on Ghirdah, the 3-headed monster",1125100800,"08 27, 2005",0.1156

The scenario is very weak and special effects poor.

I would give it two stars, but there are some things that can be enjoyed - it is the first one in which the kaijus (giant monsters) are shown in a deliberately comic way. Mothra, Godzilla and Rodan have a conversation (yes!), Godzilla's fight with Rodan looks like a bickering of two kids about a ball (in this case a big rock) and we can even see Godzilla and Rodan laughing (yes!).The twin fairies from Infant Island are also as usual very cute, as is the Venusian/Himalayan princess. Finally, you can see some Japan from the early 60s in this movie, and it comes a little as a shock to realise how fast and far this country has risen since then!All in all - this is a movie you do not really need to buy or even watch, except if you are the ultimate fan, a devoted collectioner or a scientist making a study about oversized fire breathing dark green reptiles with bad temper, poor social skills and an irresistible pulsion to trample Tokyo...",3,This movie aged badly - only for die hard fans or collectioners,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",0.0072

54,A36W5RAALXS1CS,764001035,"Mark Rainey Author of THE MONARCHS, THE NIGH...","[0, 0]","For better or for worse, Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster made for the single biggest directional shift in the history of Godzilla films, as in this movie, the biggest, baddest, and meanest monster of them all began his unlikely transformation into a heroic, if not exactly all-around good dude.Despite some very cool monster scenes and a fairly engaging human story, Ghidorah rates pretty low on my daikaiju-meter. As anyone who's read these reviews knows, in my book, giant monsters ought to be giant monsters; I was never fond of the anthropomorphizing of the critters, which became a trademark of the Godzilla series after Ghid0rah. Toho's rationale--more specifically, Eiji Tsuburaya's and screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa's--about the trend was, well, we've got to appeal to the younger set. Hey, I was the younger set in those days, and every member of the younger set I knew who enjoyed monster movies wanted his beasties big, bad, and impressive. Maybe Japanese kids...who knows...maybe this was just what oisha-san ordered. But for some of us, it felt like the beginning of the end, monster-wise.Still and all, Ghidorah was--and is--an entertaining monster romp. In my old age, any Godzilla movie is an enjoyable movie, no matter what form it takes. Even Godzilla vs. Megalon has its charms, and that's saying something; in 1977, I took my little brother with me to the theater to see Godzilla vs. Megalon, and 33 years later, I don't think he's ever forgiven me for it. Some horrific experiences just imprint themselves on the youthful mind, you know? Some of us adapt, while others do not.On the positive side, in Ghidorah, Godzilla is less the willful messiah than a monster doing what he does best: messing up other critters that transgress on his rightful territory. His first appearance is memorable: Under a peaceful, midnight blue sky, an ocean liner makes its way toward a pod of whales. Then, behind them, a telltale churning of the ocean hints that something monstrous is about to happen. Akira Ifukube's now-familiar score rises along with a dark, beastly shape, and with dorsal fins alight, Godzilla unleashes a stream of fiery death on the ship, which immediately bursts into flame. It's a great scene, one of Godzilla's best ever. And shortly thereafter, he makes landfall in the harbor district of Tokyo, followed by a handful of highly impressive daikaiju-rampage scenes.Ah, if only the rest of the movie had been made in this mode.Rodan's appearance from Mount Aso is impressive enough, but of all the monsters, he's the one who most rapidly devolves into class clown. The Rodan suit design is among the worst ever, a far cry from the evil-looking reptilian beast from his origin film. In the commentary that accompanies the U.S. version, author David Kalat makes a reasoned case for why the monster buffoonery could be taken as a good thing, particularly in that the associated financial boon assured a new Godzilla film from Toho every few months. Be that as it may, once the monsters start mixing it up, the movie becomes a wrestling match between rubber suits. For the rest of the Showa series, the majestic, fearsome, awe-inspiring moments so prevalent in the earlier films become fewer and farther between. As a kid, this didn't sit well with me, no sir, not at all, and though I love the Godzilla movies these days more than ever, I still can't help but cringe a little when I watch the ridiculous volleyball match between Godzilla and Rodan.Ghidorah's birth and attack on Tokyo goes a ways toward setting things right, at least for a time. Many of the destruction scenes rate among Eiji Tsuburaya's most spectacular work, and Ghidorah's design really is awesome. He, at least, is played straight, even during the more comical battles.Then there's the conversation between Godzilla, Rodan, and Mothra, as the big caterpillar attempts to convince the other two to join up as a tag team and whomp Ghidorah's twin-tailed ass. Obviously, there are those who find the scene humorous and even endearing. I, as you might surmise, am not one of them.On this very nicely presented Classic Media DVD, we have both the original Japanese version and the dubbed U.S. version, which is more radically edited than one might expect upon viewing it without the original for comparison. Dramatically, some of the alterations work quite well, while others are completely superfluous. Lots of scenes are shuffled around, particularly those that involve Godzilla and Rodan's initial appearances; the Venusian prophetess (Akiko Wakabayashi) in the U.S. version becomes a Martian prophetess; and--quite inexplicably--much of Akira Ifukube's excellent score has been replaced by unremarkable film library music. However, a few changes are actually beneficial to the film, such as the deletion of a reprise of Mothra's song, which slows the pacing of the Japanese version down to a merciless crawl. And near the end of the film, during the scenes of Detective Shindo (Yosuke Natsuki) rescuing the prophetess/Princess Salno from killer Malness (Hisaya Ito), the sounds of the monster battle are heard in the background--which only makes sense, since they are obviously fighting in close proximity.Like the rest of the Classic Media DVD Godzilla releases, this one is an absolute must for the avid Godzillaphile--whether you believe that Ghidorah is a classic among classics or the beginning of the devolution of a once-fearsome atomic horror.",3,The Greatest Battle on Earth(?),1267142400,"02 26, 2010",0.1873

Godzilla historians will note that this is the film where Godzilla starts to transform from atomic horror to Japan's savior. Ghidorah is an awsome creature in his own right, but incorperating 3 other monsters in the film just made it that much better. The few downers for this movie are few but many. Wouln't have been better for somewhere in the film for larva Mothra to transform into an adult Mothra before battling Ghidorah with Rodan and Godzilla? She could have done ariel dive bombs at Ghidorah while Rodan does the same. All the larva can do is bite Ghidorah's tail and hang on for the ride. At the beginning of the film, a jet plane carring the princess of Japan ( or something like that ) explodes with a very unimpressive explosian. Lastly, when Ghidorah causes a rock slide, one of the baddies in the movie happens to be underneath it.

The reporter looks out into the sky and sees the meteorite that will give Earth a few problems. Stay tuned for more details. The reporter leaves and the dude's boss comes in and tells the guy to guard a european princess, Salina Salno, who is being sent to Japan because of an assination plot to kill her. Then the scenes switches to the Princess being hypnotised by an alien in a flying saucer to get off the plane, and the plane blows, up and a proffessor goes to find the meteorite, that fell, and will later find out that it holds Ghidrah. Later, the policeman finds the princess ands she's a martian from Venus. While this is happening, the assasinators are sent to kill the princess, this goes on for a while so I won't go to deep into it, and while THIS is happening, Rodan and Godzilla appear and start wrecking the place.

Close as I came to a couch potato and it made me really interested in Japan. I've been waiting so long to find these films given a proper digital conversion. The last few years have made me very excited (for an adult) as Toho has finally pulled the cork out of its uptight behind 15+ years into the digital revolution and allowed the west to see the Japanese-language widescreen versions of most of the Godzilla oeuvre without spending $$$ on an import.As usual, on Ghidorah, Classic Media has added some interesting short extras.

On time she tell Japan that King Ghidorah will attack Tokyo ! So Mothra tries to convince Godzilla and Rodan to become good and fight King Ghidorah. They disagree so Mothra will fight by herself.

Back in 1998, we got a VHS release of the movie for the first time in YEARS. The film was pan and scan and was discolored and grainy. Not the perfect print for such a classic but we really didn't complain much because we finally got a chance to own the film.Classic Media did a great job in bringing us a widescreen version of the U.S. release and the Toho Scope Japanese version! The coloring is great, the sound is wonderful, and there is considerably much less grain than on the VHS release a handful of years earlier!There are some nice extras on this DVD including a trailer, a poster slide-show, and film commentary!

There are some changes they should have made. First, aliens. Why aliens? It is waaaay to corny. Second, Ghidrah. Way did Toho make Ghidrah look like he was a drunken elf? Ghidrah didn't have to shake his legs, heads, and wings uncontrolably! And third, MAKE GODZILLA AND THE OTHER MONSTERS GOOD GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would've given this movie five stars if Godzilla wasn't good! That mistake made the rest of the Showa series dumb.

78,A1NDYL6D6QNVCI,764001035,Valnastar Man With No Name,"[10, 10]","Like the other releases in this series, Classic Media has done an excellent job presenting both the original Japanese language version of this movie as well as the US theatrical version. The film quality and DVD quality is crisp and clear and the sound and color are terrific. My only criticism is that the commentary was not done by Ed Godziszewski and or Steve Ryfle as it was on some of the other releases. While their commentary was thoughtful, selective and well-paced, the commentary on this disc, presented by David Kalat, is done in an unceasing and hurried manner with a highly affected voice that seems to be trying to squeeze everything he's ever learned about Godzilla film history into just 85 minutes. It's irritating and over-the-top manner proves that even for avid Godzilla film buffs it's possible to try and present too much information all at once. There is good information in there, but it's surrounded by breathless clutter that I at least found to be highly irritating. Good effort, but poor delivery.However, Ghidrah (aka Ghidorah) is still one of the coolest monsters in film history and the film is enjoyable, both versions. After all, what monster movie buff doesn't love a giant, three-headed, electrical dragon from outer space? Ghidorah has everything a monster buff could want in a single package!

Along with MechaGodzilla, King Ghidora would be Godzilla's most consistent and dangerous challenger, and return time and time again. In this version, King Ghidora is fresh from the destruction of Venus and its entire population. Flying through space disguised as a meteor, he arrives on Earth looking for new prey.Another first, the first battle between Godzilla and Rodan, tears across the Japanese country side. In a sad last, the final appearance of Emi and Yuki Ito as the Shobijin, the tiny twins summon the larval Mothra to halt the battle, and to convince the two raging beasts that they are good, not bad, and should band together to protect Earth from King Ghidora. This encounter sets the stage for most Godzilla flicks to follow, with the big guy being a defender of humanity rather than its destroyer.A really fun entry in the Godzilla series, and King Ghidora makes for an excellent villain. It would be nice to see this film get a decent DVD treatment, with its actual title restored and the original Japanese language track, instead of the terrible dubbing that harms so many Godzilla films.",4,"A kinder, gentler Godzilla",1102809600,"12 12, 2004",-0.0475
