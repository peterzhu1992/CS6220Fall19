0,A33E0CODNP98PV,061529118X,B. Davis crazy about books,"[2, 2]","My husband and I love watching hummingbirds in the summer, so when I heard about this video, I just had to buy it! It is the story of a mother hummingbird that inhabits a tiny nest in the most unlikely of places, and raises her family there, year after year. The shots are intimate and spectacular. We learned more than we had previously known about the little birds and highly recommend this to others who are as fasinated by them as we are.",5,A Beautiful Story,1261872000,"12 27, 2009",0.2724
1,AJLW1DZSHOVGW,061529118X,Elaine Campbell Desert Dweller,"[2, 2]","After reading First Flight - A Mother Hummingbird's Story, I was delighted to learn that during a three year period filmmakers Don and Noriko Carroll had patiently and lovingly captured Honey, a black-chin hummingbird, and her brood, two hatchlings the size of coffee beans on film. As Don Carroll explains in the featurette following the documentary, he and his wife, Noriko, were at an advantage of being able to capture such intimate and unimpeded footage of the hummingbirds because of the location of the nest - a clothesline out in the open, rather than in a tree which would have been much more difficult to film due to thickness of branches and leaves, winds and the difficulties in placing cameras in advantageous positions.In this film we actually view the movement inside the eggs of the future hatchlings, watch them puncture the first hole in the eggs, rest and then continue their pursuit to break through to their new lives. What is particularly moving is the attentiveness of their mother, Honey, as she watches over, nurtures and protects her two offspring, especially from the Carroll's family cat.Speaking of this cat, it's not just any cat. No, it is Birthday, stepping right out of the pages of another book of the Carrolls, Happy Birthday the Cat, which has some terrific photographs of this pretty feline. One in particular that I like is of Birthday sitting all alone on the shore of a California beach with the surf rolling in. How much she looks at home there.So it is wonderful after reading these two delightful books to see their subjects come alive on film. The cinematography is remarkable; Noriko Carroll's narration is gentle and informative.And don't miss the Slide Show feature for some breathtaking photographic stills of these wondrous birds.",5,Priceless footage of hummingbird life up close,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",0.5853
2,A14PMSGUCFV8ZI,061529118X,Ruth Sims Ruth,"[10, 14]","The visuals were fascinating (did you know a hummingbird egg is the size of a coffee bean?) and the hatching was adorable. However, we gave up and watched it as a silent movie because the sound was annoyingly muffled and we could understand almost nothing of the narration. Why in the world didn't they (a) provide captions or (b) have someone else narrate it? Her voice is pleasant and soothing, but there was no point in listening to the narration at all; I wasn't even sure she was speaking English until I caught a stray word or two. I would have liked to hear the background music, but unfortunately, I couldn't because the sound was off. Frustrating! I am going to return it and get the one with F. Murray Abraham.I bought the DVD as a Christmas gift for my husband. I wish I had bought the book.",2,"Loved viuals, terrible sound & narration",1325376000,"01 1, 2012",0.0823
3,A1R9MNKXD0CBKO,061529118X,Sarah S.,"[0, 0]","I have always been fascinated by humming birds. In the 1980's I had the same house and feeder in the same place for four years. Over that time there were three hummingbirds who visited each year. They would watch me weed, fight a little but mostly they made me smile. This film is a jewel. The narrators soft accent is somewhat lilting, but in a positive way. It's a fascinating film and the cinematography was amazing!",5,a real Humm dinger!,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",0.3886

About an hour ago Mrs. Spudman and I watched First Flight and we were both enthralled. Through most of the video I was stunned by the sight of things I had never seen before like the tiny hummingbird eggs, the laying of the two eggs, the hatching, and of course the first flight of the two hummingbird fledglings.This video was three years in the making because of weather, missed shots and the hummingbirds' unwillingness to take direction. The film itself is a masterpiece and the short documentary explaining the making of the film was also quite interesting. Also included on the DVD is a slide show of hummingbirds. The only shots of the colorful males are shown in the slide show.Honey, the mother hummingbird, built the nest and nurtured her young solo.We were disappointed the video wasn't a little longer, but like the hummingbird, beautiful things can appear in small packages.",5,Met All Expectations,1266537600,"02 19, 2010",0.3029
