Although I like Beck, I will thoroughly read reviews of any book he promotes prior to purchase. I intended to give this to my nephew to balance out the public school drivel he is being fed. So I decided I would watch it first for my own edification and then gift it on. Well, I could hardly make it through thirty minutes! The two hosts from TBN seem, I'm sorry to say, the most superficial TV preaching team I have come across on the 'God Channels' and Barton spoke to them in an interview format and then to the camera at other times. In an effort to transition or move the subject matter along, there is what appears to be an 'opener' piece that is Completely repetitive! Not just at the beginning of the next DVD but several times in the thirty minutes I watched! It was maddening and I finally came to the point where I was no longer willing to endure this just to learn more about our country and turned it off and packed it up with Huge disappointment. I really wanted to like this. It is now clear to me this man had absolutely No professional help with this series except for the DVD box design, which leads one to anticipate something professional inside. Very disappointed in the money I spent. Wanted to list it for sale but can't bring myself to it. Leaving it at the Salvation Army.",2,Did not read the reviews!,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",-0.0395

Had I seen parts of it prior to purchase I would not have bought it. Most of the video is him talking to TBN hosts. It would have been a better video witout the connection of TBN hosts. He should have talked to the audience (or camera) and not to the two people sitting there with him.The presentation was subdued and I have to say boring. Great information was provided but you had to force yourself to stay awake to hear it.I was also disappointed that the segnments all started with the same introduction. It was like it was an addition to add more time to the length of the video so you could advertise it as a longer length.Very disappointed.For anyone else I recommend you skip the movie and buy the book.,2,Disappointment,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",0.1397

Our family home schools our children and we were hoping to be able to use the series to educate our children about the christian message. The American Heritage Series is basically just a long lecture. Its an unpolished narrated lecture that makes history boring like they do in many classrooms. David is like the expert professor who puts his class to sleep because of presentation. I rate him 3 stars.

This is the History of our nation in the words of the men who made the history. The recent textbook battle in Texas was largely over this issue: getting the real history of our nation back into the history books.

In addition, Mr. Barton speaks very fast and dispenses a large volume of information in a short amount of time. The result is that the episodes tend to be dry and boring. Adding to these difficulties is the fact the DVDs include the promotions for the series from when it aired on TV. As a result the episodes are interupted approximately every 8 minutes with what amounts to a commercial for the series. This gets exceptionally tiring after a short period of time. While I would wish that every high school student in the nation along and every adult citizen study this series, I think that anyone who is not seriously interested in the subject matter will find watching it to be a tedious affair.",4,You have to be really interested.,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",0.0031

I went to school during the revisionist period of our country. What a bunch of lies we learned in school. I too believed in the statement Separation of Church and State I am looking forward to watching these DVDS with my children to show them a small part of the true history of our Great country. We have failed in remembering our long and proud history.I hope to live the rest of my life up to the standards of the Founding Fathers.

I love listening to and watching him.I received the set yesterday, 9-26-11, and watched the first two DVDs. They even look good playing them on the computer but are better on an HDTV.How many of us actually knew there were about 250 Founding Fathers/Framers? I actually knew of a few, probably like most. Like David says, around the 60's they started changing the way we learned history and moved away from the faith aspects of the Founders and moved toward the economic aspects. Most who want to change history talk about Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson about being non-religous and portray all founders that way. They might have been the least religous but in today's world they would be far more outspoken about faith and God than most preachers today.For anyone who wants to learn the truth about our history I would highly recommend this series.

Evolution is what was preached and shoved down our throats. History became boring and choking with it's evolution and anti-America BS, bringing me to pull out of the rest of my history classes and having a distaste for (public) education.

Real, documented, unspoken facts are still out there to show us the reality of things and to show us that we're not crazy to think that things have seemed suspiciously out of wack for decades. It's actually more than decades when you start seeing where and how the truth and intent of our founders and Constitution have been corrupted. To those who have looked at history as something bland and boring and who've listened to TV experts and political pundits tell you about our roots and founding and founders intent and Constitution and who has manipulated who, you will find this information and the documents presented to be very surprising. I was pretty stunned to find out a few things in particular. It's one thing to hear judges, lawyers and pundits tell you about their interpretation of the Constitution and founders intent and quite another to see and hear the founders words and documents setting the record straight. There is so much more. The sections on Americans of African decent are pretty amazing as well. The history of unity and patriotism is nice to learn after our usual TV diet of division and accusation. Unity and patriotism DO also have a strong history in America. America really is a great country wherever patriots stand. I also love the way these DVDs not only don't hold back, but they show the strong religious heritage that guided our founders. They just lay it out there and as we all know, facts are stubborn things. There are some amazing stories about the patriot preachers who guided their congregations to stand for their God given rights. My only wish is that they would have removed some title sequences and just kept the dialogue moving. Since this was originally produced for TV, the title sequences that would come out of commercials or breaks are in there. Some info is repeated several times on these discs, but it's interesting information and since there is so much information on these discs, it's not a bad thing to hear points of interest a few times in different context to help you absorb it. David Barton does an excellent job laying out the stories and documented history of this country. If you really take pride in this country and want to understand why we excelled and what obstacles have run interference, this is a very worthy investment that I will I think that many would watch over and over and encourage others to watch. It would make an exellent gift too.",5,Much more interesting than the usual watered down PC history!,1255996800,"10 20, 2009",0.3191
12,A2P3OJWECVTOET,740318934,J. Spurway,"[9, 30]","I am somewhat of an early American history buff. Don't mind differing points of view about analysis of historical events. I decided to watch American History in Black and White first since I didn't see any numbering on the disks.I had never heard of Historian David Barton.About 2 minutes into the DVD, when he started talking about the Bible, I thought maybe I should look him up online.About 16 minutes into the DVD he connects the pro-slavery Democrats of the 1800s as the same Democrats who are pro-choice today. I suspect he is referring to the inbreeding so prevalent in Democrat families. And, explains The Civil Rights Act of 1964 votes.I thought about waiting until I had watched all 4 DVDs but I think I know where Barton is going. Barton seems to be using this DVD as a political statement against the Democratic Party of today.Back to history, I think Barton does what some other folks who write about history do. History is about people. He generalizes his knowledge and his morality and tries to lay that structure on history and draw conclusions about why things happened, why people acted the way they did.For example he thinks slavery is evil, so does not feel he needs to present the reasons why some people defended slavery. Defended it with their lives. Christians. He does not present history, he presents history through his modern eyes.I do appreciate the detail he cites in early American history. He cites sources that are fairly obscure and not usually mentioned in other general history overviews.",1,mostly an anti democrat party dvd - a few good history facts,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",-0.0363

Historian David Barton does an amazing job of exploring the past and presenting in an informative and interesting way. Our entire family enjoyed watching each episode. It was neat to be able to pause and hear our children's thoughts on various topics and to hear that they had learned in school much of the information presented in this documentary. It is also a great asset to homeschool curriculum and teaches a lot of the things not being currently taught in many schools.Although not a big deal, there is a short (seconds long) repeating segment on each episode - almost like a preview. It may have been that this series aired on TV and they were showing this repeating segment before or after a commercial. However, again, this wasn't a big deal. We merely fast-forwarded during the repeating segment.This series is fascinating and an eye-opening refresher course for adults. It is well-produced and timely.
