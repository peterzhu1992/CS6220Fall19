Unfortunately the director (whose husband was killed in action in that war) blames the US and the South Vietnamese governments for those tragedies and fails to mention the dreadful atrocities inflicted by the Vietnamese Communist guerillas on many innocent South Vietnamese and indigenous tribal men, women, children. Despite this distorted retrospective look, the film is well made and worth seeing. The film's most redeeming premise is that war indelibly alters the lives of all who suffer the trauma and loss that occurs during wartime.",2,Cockeyed Perspective Taints Provocative Subject,1113696000,"04 17, 2005",-0.5182
1,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,767024427,Joe Sherry,"[5, 5]","I had been looking for a copy of Regret to Inform for several years now. I finally had a chance to watch the documentary and I was blown away. This is a very painful documentary to watch. It deals with the widows of the Vietnam War and how they dealt with the experience of losing their husbands and also about the years after. Surprisingly, this documentary also features Vietnamese women who lost their husbands in the war (the Vietnamese call it the American War).I have read many soldiers accounts of the war (Tim O'Brien, Philip Caputo, Robert Mason, etc) and I have read histories of what happened and why on the political side of the conflict. What I have very little experience with is the homefront, the families of the soldiers. Regret to Inform does not address any political ramifications of the war or the reasons for it. Regret to Inform has everything to do with the women. It is a painful story to watch unfold.The American widows have had to deal with their men going to a foreign country and to kill people who did nothing to them. One Native American woman recalls how her husband saw how similar he looked to the Vietnamese and how incomprehensible it was that he would be called to kill these men. Another woman tells of her husband who came home, but was already dead. He held on for years, but suffered the affects of Agent Orange. For him, going home from Vietnam was only the beginning of the war.The Vietnamese widows have a similar, but somewhat different story to tell. While they deal with the same grief from the loss of their husbands, they also had to deal with the fact that the war was on their lands, in their homes. They say American soldiers walking through their villages, killing their children. This is the story that they are telling, of the horror of being in the war, but not fighting it. Their homes were bombed as they try to feed their families. They have both physical and emotional suffering and it is difficult to comprehend the nature of their suffering.This is a powerful and painful film. Because of the very nature of the subject, this is an anti-war film. It was nominated for an Academy Award. This is an excellent film.",4,powerful and painful,1053561600,"05 22, 2003",-0.3692
2,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,767024427,Linda Linguvic,"[16, 18]","Nominated for an Oscar in 1999 and winner of best documentary and best cinematography at Sundance, this little film is tremendously intense. Twenty years after her husband was killed in Vietnam, filmmaker Barbara Sonneborn interviewed more than 200 American and Vietnamese women widowed by the war. She traveled to Vietnam to interview the Vietnamese widows and the scenes in Vietnam are haunting with their magnificent cinematography and graphic stories as told by the women. In between the interviews, and sometimes in the background, she uses rare archival footage to reinforce the individual stories.The American women are living with the memories long after their husbands' deaths, wondering about what happened over there. There's a woman who wishes she had the nerve to smash her husband's hand to keep him from going, a woman whose husband wasn't killed in Vietnam, but came home sick with multiple cancers from Agent Orange, a Native American woman whose husband, a former rodeo rider, felt a racial connection to the Vietnamese people. Most of all though, it was the Vietnamese women whose stories were the most moving. After all, the war took place on their land. They also lost children and parents and had their homes burned down. Some of them were tortured and all of them have memories of murder and destruction. It is all so very very sad.Yes, this is an anti-war film, produced many years after the Vietnam war, at a time when people would rather forget. But for those whose lives were forever altered, there is no forgetting. This film remembers.",5,"Some woud rather forget, but his film remembers...",982972800,"02 24, 2001",-0.2257
3,A36DSZZST9T1RQ,767024427,Spyral Its All Just A Ride,"[0, 0]","Regret to Inform as some have stated in their reviews here, does, perhaps, have an anti-war bias behind it, but it isn't like it is disguised or anything. The film merely poses these questions:What are the costs of war?How have women and families been effected by war?What are the similarities and differences of the experiences that women in America and Vietnam have in regard to the war?While some may say that pointing out the fact that Vietnam was no direct threat to America, and that the people of Vietnam suffered much more, and their trauma is much more lasting and deeper than those who had the luxury of not having bombs dropped on their neighborhoods, or soldiers accidentally shooting their family members, the fact is that these are truisms that one cannot escape.There is an emphasis on those women who were caught on the wrong side of the conflict, and yes, we do meet some women who fought alongside the Communists, but this is the point. The filmmaker wanted to show what it was like for the people whom we considered the enemy, as well as those who were our own family.The fact that there is no treatment of those who were victimized by their own countrymen is a valid criticism, and it would be nice to see that side of the picture as well.However, the reviewer who dismisses the fact that a couple women that we meet were fighters with the Communists is a moot point. War effects everyone, no matter which side you take. The fact that the tour guide that the woman met in the village where her husband was killed had fought alongside the Communists in that same area was an ironic, and I thought very important part of the film. To leave it out just because she was on the side of the enemy would have been shallow, and not in the spirit of the film.Over 30 years after the war ended for us, we need to go back and see with new eyes the legacy of what we were involved with. Just as with Clint Eastwood's Letters From Iwo Jima there comes a time when you need to stop seeing a former enemy, and start seeing fellow human beings who suffered just as you did, regardless of what side they happened to be on.",4,"Biased?

I'm also the sister of a Vietnam Vet who died of Agent Orange poisoning. REGRET TO INFORM is one of the best documentaries to be done about that historic period. I've used this documentary in my college classes, and it has brought many students to tears. It has also affected the soldiers in my classes profoundly. This semester, a young man who just finished his training in the Airforce, said he has been forever changed by the images in this movie and that he understands for the first time what effect war has on civilians. I believe that in looking at Sonneborn's film, we ALL have to take into account what her purpose was. I don't find this documentary to be one-sided because Sonneborn achieves what she sets out to do: to connect with other wives and allow them to talk about their pain, hoping to assuage her own pain in the process. She does look at the losses from both sides.Indeed, in her film, war itself is the atrocity. Of course more attention is going to be paid to the consequences of The American War for the Vietnamese: the war was in their country. Many of them experienced total devastation and wrecked lives, whole families slaughtered. In one heart-wrenching moment, for instance, a Vietnamese woman shares that nearly her entire family was killed before they had a chance to eat breakfast. She weeps for them, even to this day.The gift of this movie is that it shows the extent to which these women have reconciled their lives with the pain of war, and it shows the power of forgiveness. At one point, Sonneborn encounters the people who may very well have been responsible for the death of her husband, yet she treats them with dignity and respect, participates in a solemn ceremony with them for all that has been lost. Moreover, Sonneborn HAS to focus on the brutality of American troops because her own husband acknowledged it and tried to make humanistic choices in the face of all the confusion that was Vietnam. The other American women in this film have to face up to the fact that their husbands might have committed brutal acts.One of the reasons this acknowledgment of American brutality is so important is that young people today don't understand that Americans are capable of it: they think we're more moral than others. To illustrate: one of my students thought the Vietnamese had invented and sprayed Agent Orange!Until Americans face the fact that we are no better nor any worse than any other human being, we will be victims of our own hypocrisy and fail to grow as individuals and as a nation.",5,One of the Best Vietnam War Documentaries I've Seen,1161216000,"10 19, 2006",-0.4256
