1,A1TONI9A0YFOD6,767016351,Bruce Rux,"[0, 0]","Castle De'ath is an unusual Avengers entry, in that Steed and Emma are both undercover at the same place at the same time, from the very start of the episode. The cinematography is curiously rather bleached, for what probably should have been a starker melodrama - but it works splendidly, anyway. This one consists mostly of skulking and good fights, Emma's skulking done in a fetching peignoir by moonlight. The flirtation between Emma and Steed is especially light and playful. The plot, about a secret submarine base and its connection to the disruption of the local economy, is clever and credibly handled.The Master Minds is one of my personal favorites, about a MENSA-esque high-I.Q. club called RANSACK, which utilizes the best minds in Britain - without their knowledge - to infiltrate and sabotage military bases, and steal state secrets for sale to the highest bidder. It's quite similar to Ian Fleming's contemporaneous James Bond novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service - which, amusingly enough, starred Diana Rigg in the film version. Like Castle De'ath, Steed and Emma work undercover at the same location, but with a far different result: Emma becomes brainwashed into RANSACK's nocturnal espionage society, and Steed has to snap her out of it - before she kills him. The concluding fight is terrific, Emma's final punch-line one of the more humorous in the series by means of its unique delivery.A very good pair of early Avengers episodes.",5,Steed Boosts His I.Q. - Emma Boosts State Secrets,1020124800,"04 30, 2002",0.2431
2,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,767016351,Daniel Jolley darkgenius,"[0, 0]","Although somewhat campy at times, The Avengers was an intellectual show, featuring puzzling mysteries, witty dialogue, bits of comedy, and an incredibly suave, cool agent in John Steed. With the introduction of Emma Peel, this great show became a phenomenon sure to remain a part of our culture for decades to come. Diana Rigg as Mrs. Peel is mesmerizing. Here we have a beautiful woman who is a brilliant scientist, a martial arts master, a great detective, and a special agent second to none. While most female television characters of the time tended to their families, Mrs. Peel busied herself in safeguarding her nation. Steed himself is no match for her in terms of intellect, but together they make an unbeatable team, with a magical chemistry that is readily apparent from the very start.This set contains the first six Emma Peel episodes. Mrs. Peel quickly evolves from Steed's helper to Steed's equal. It took a little while to flesh out the new character, I believe; thus, these episodes seem to get progressively better as they go along. The Town of No Return is rather a weak story to my mind, but Mrs. Peel does show us her combat skills, which at this point seem rather contrived. The Gravediggers is much more interesting, witty, and satisfying. It is in fact one of my favorite episodes. Beginning with problems with the nation's defense system, the story features cemeteries, doctors of an uncommon sort, and a brilliantly funny eccentric old gentleman with an overpowering love of trains--the train ride he shares with the visiting John Steed is priceless; it ends with Mrs. Peel tied up to a railroad track and almost killed by a miniature locomotive. This is The Avengers at its best. The Cybernauts, while good, is of great importance because it is the first episode ever shown in the USA and because it spawned two later sequels. Death at Bargain Prices features some of the best dialogue between Steed and Mrs. Peel, full of the sexual tension many reviewers like to point to. Only The Avengers could take the idea of a department store in London housing a nuclear bomb and make it work for audiences. Castle De'ath is a dark tale of history, treachery, and dungeon torture. Although the true purpose of the bad guys did not make complete sense to me, the story is very strong , succeeding in disproving my own suspicions (as well as Mrs. Peels') as to the identify of the culprit. Finally, The Master Minds rounds out this set with the story of an intellectual society whose members are unwittingly prompted to commit crimes against the Crown.Mrs. Peel really comes into her own in these last two tales. In the final episode, it is her intellect that allows Steed to penetrate the secretive society and learn its secrets (although Mrs. Peel finds herself participating--albeit without conscious knowledge--in the nefarious plans of the master mind); it is also her slyness that essentially saves Steed's life in the end. However, Castle De'ath speaks volumes in my mind in terms of Mrs. Peel's position in the society of the 1960s. All of the men in the episode, include John McSteed all wear traditional Scottish kilts. While this is nothing unusual for the locale in which the story takes place, nevertheless the fact remains that the only character who wears pants is Emma Peel. By this time, Mrs. Peel has shed any vestiges of being Steed's helper and has become his unchallengeable equal. The Avengers is intelligent, humorous, decidedly cool television that towers above just about everything on the air today.",5,Emma Peel Volume One,1012089600,"01 27, 2002",0.3373
3,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,767016351,"Deborah MacGillivray Author,","[6, 8]","Each of Steed's ladies made their own mark. Honor Blackman's Kathy Gale, set the pace. Sleek sassy women, who were as smart as they were sexy. They held their own in a man's world and didn't need someone to take care of them. Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims, wives or secretaries on telly at the time. Blackman made less of an impact in US, because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement, to keep people from seeing reruns. Since they were run on ABC, tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.Rigg came along and made Emma Peel a character that will go down in the hall of fame. She is as popular today, if not more so. So when she left--to do as Blackman did -- go on to be a Bond girl, Steed had to have another partner. Enter Tara King. She gorgeous full figure Canadian with eyes to do for. They tried to play on her more feminine side (and with horrid fashions). Seriously, the clothes designers for Tara needs shooting. For the most part, they couldn't design more dumpy look clothes. They stuffed her in a series of wigs - some very bad - so point one, she was fighting an uphill battle. Also, the scripts were not as sharp. Even so Tara is charming and a pleasure to watch.Episodes include:Wish You Were HereStay TunedTake Me to Your LeaderFogHomocide and Old LaceLove AllGet-A-Way",5,final series of Tara's run,1126310400,"09 10, 2005",0.2007

They whisper, but not quiet enough. The barber is killed. The list of potential traitors includes three high ranking officers. They have weaknesses: drunkeness (leading to headaches), gambling (to the extent of neglecting official duties), and womanizing. They also have butlers. Steed decides to join a butling (gentlemen's) school. The action becomes more heated with Mrs. Peel joining the force as an officer's girlfriend. At the end Steed and Mrs. Peel are saved by a retired, senile, patriotic, but not really demented general.",5,Can you take me now for a quick scrape and a hot towel ..?,1021334400,"05 14, 2002",-0.0571

After all, any line like &quot;Lady Bracknell, your handbag&quot; is not designed for the high school dropout. Shot at a lower budget, these black and whites use exterior shots a lot more than do the more studio-bound color series. Some episodes (&quot;The Hour That Never Was&quot; for example) are a little slow-moving compared with gems like &quot;The Return of the Cybernauts&quot; and &quot;Death at Bargain Prices.&quot; My only negative comment is Death to Whoever tried to glamorize Rigg with all that horrible lip rouge about half way into the series. And while we are at it, since A&amp;E nicely fit three episodes onto a single reel in Vol. 6, why do all the others have only two? But at any price, these tapes are unbeatable for sophisticated wit and tongue-in-cheek adventure.

9,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,767016351,Patrick W. Crabtree The Old Grottomaster,"[2, 2]","James Bond, move over! This is a set of six, 52-minute entries from the great and brilliant team of Patrick Macnee (as the aristocratic John Steed) and Diana Rigg (as the tantalizing Emma Peel). The Rigg years were definitely the best ones and there is one other set from 1966 (also with Rigg) so don't confuse them! All these episodes were shot in black-and-white and the aspect is full-screen. Here's a rundown of the episodes:The 13th Hole -- A Mad Scientist/International Intrigue vehicle where a golf course country club is being used as a cover location. Steed and Mrs. Peel tee-off on the bad guys. This is a really great episode! Written by Terry Williamson.Quick-Quick-Slow Death -- A dancing school is the focus, where some mighty underhanded stuff is going on -- but who is the ring-leader of the skullduggery? Written by Robert Banks Stewart.Small Game for Big Hunters -- A Jungle-full of tropical shenanigans, including savage natives with blowguns, and a plot of biological sabotage just a few miles from London? It's so and viewers will love this one -- Lots of cool sets. Written by Philip Levene.The Girl from Auntie -- A fake Mrs. Peel! The real one is being auctioned off to a pack of mean international bidders! Pretty good. Written by Roger Marshall.Silent Dust -- This is one of my big favorites. A group of very bad people plan to hold all England for ransom -- if they don't get paid, they'll release the Silent Dust which exterminates all life. It all culminates during a big fox-hunt! Great casting in this entry. Written by Roger Marshall.Room Without A View -- Important scientists go missing and end up in a very nasty Asian prison camp... sort of. It's really all happening inside an exclusive hotel. Steed, who poses as a gourmet hotel critic, and Mrs. Peel have to solve the deadly mystery and get back these top scientists. Written by Roger Marshall.I don't know if you get the same deal if you purchase the DVD set -- with the VHS set, you'll get 3 tapes, with two episodes per tape (with the other '66 set, there's a bonus episode, which makes three episodes on one of the tapes), for a total of 6 episodes. The tapes are not copy-protected.There were Avengers episodes prior to 1965 but they weren't quite as good -- they were more soap opera-ish. Macnee had two or three different lady-partners during those earlier years and those gals simply weren't as dynamic as Rigg. Also, the music, action, and story-writing much improved in '65, which is when The Avengers got launched on to American television -- I watched every one of these episodes at the time. These black-and-white Macnee-Rigg entries continued through 1966, (it went color after that and Rigg eventually left the series). In the end, '65 and '66 were the two best years of all.",5,Superb British cult B&W television!,1206489600,"03 26, 2008",0.0766
