More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less.",4,Good Stuff This!,1085011200,"05 20, 2004",0.3221

4,A1C384NS531WXA,738900370,Edward Gordon Brown,"[16, 19]","Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they do. Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays, even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit, out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece. This is a definite crowd pleaser, for sure.",5,A wonderful video,942019200,"11 8, 1999",0.5393
5,A3VREOCVARPZRM,738900370,Greatwood,"[1, 2]",G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen! Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!! Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!! I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents! Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!,5,Perfection!,1117670400,"06 2, 2005",0.5924
6,A4QXQO4O749CW,738900370,Guybert,"[9, 10]","What an excellent video! Joe, Steve and Eric each do amazing sets on their own and then they come together at the end for three songs that you will never hear them play individually. Awesome! Plus, you get to see Mike Keneally, who played rhythm guitar with Vai, who really impressed me. I'd heard his name before, but I didn't know he was so good. I'd love to see one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video, you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing talent (though this version is better than the album version by far). In conclusion, you will definitely not be disappointed if you buy this. The picture quality is good and the sound quality is even better. It is an impressive video that should belong in any music lovers collection.",5,"You've heard them, now see them!",962668800,"07 4, 2000",0.6343

Still, this disc should provide enough minutes of cool licks and good rock effects to satisfy most fans of rock/blues guitar virtuosity.Satriani. My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a power trio set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, Summer Song sounds terribly thin with the guitar way up here and the bass way down there. No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's Live in San Francisco two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. The Attutute Song especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback. His bandmate, Mike Keneally, added some much welcomed rhythm guitar, keyboards, and matched Steve lick for lick in some dual lead guitar work (impressive!). This set was the most musically well rounded of the three. Steve shows that he loves the rock 'n' roll stage, and his involved and animated persona is fun to watch.G3. Three great tunes, although I agree with previous reviewers that there was something lacking in the sound. I listened to this on 3.1 (no speakers in the back) and found that Satriani and Johnson could be heard well enough, center and left, respectively, although the extreme separation was a little weird. Vai's guitar was relegated to the right channel, and seemed distant; you had to strain to hear his licks. Bit of a disappointment.Overall this is a good, not great, rock guitar DVD which fell short in terms of length and sound quality.",3,Good playing; sets were too fragmented; sound problems,1041033600,"12 28, 2002",0.2177

If you are a rock guitar player, this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai, as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza, deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson, I have to say, has a very different personality, melodic approach, and technique from Vai and Satriani, but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better.",4,You have to get this G3 DVD and then get the other two,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",0.3251

Fletcher Whatthe,"[1, 1]",I was one of the lucky people who witnessed this show in person at Northrup Auditorium and will always remember it as the show that's my favorite of all time. I've seen Joe Satriani about 4 times and he never disappoints. Steve Vai's set was great and Mike Keneally stole the show there. Eric Johnson was great but he was very subdued compared to Satch and Vai. Overall THE BEST Concert I've ever seen in person.

Puziss,"[13, 13]","I love to listen to any album with good guitar playing,except for classical.It's not that it isn't good,I just don't like it.I checked out the CD and decided that it would be more fun to watch on DVD.Here is my review of each guitarist on here:Joe Satriani starts off the show.He is the guitarist I was most familiar with before buying the CD and DVD.He plays the songs Cool No.9,Flying in a Blue Dream,and Summer Song.The third one is my favorite.He is my all time favorite guitarist(Vai is second).Eric Johnson is next.He is the guitarist I was least familiar with.He is the most melodic guitarist here.On here,he plays the songs Intro Song,Manhattan,and SRV.On the CD,he plays Zap,Manhattan,and Camel's Night Out.Manhattan is my favorite on both.I like it because it sounds jazzy.Steve Vai closes this show.He is probably my second favorite guitarist on here.He is definitely the most of a showman.Plus he has The Incredible Mike Keneally on guitar and keyboards.He plays the songs Answers,For The Love of God,and Attitude Song.In Attitude Song,him and Mike Keneally duel with each other,and Keneally is just as fast.Last becomes the best moment of all.All 3 G's jam together!They play the Freddie King/Jeff Beck classic Going Down,the Frank Zappa classic My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama,and a nine minute blues workout on the Jimi Hendrix classic Red House.The second is my favorite.Joe sings the first song,Steve and Keneally sing the second,and Eric sings the last.None of them can really sing.I can't wait to go to G3 '03 with Yngwie Malmsteen instead of Eric Johnson.P.S.I went there.It was awesome,but this concert was better.I missed Eric Johnson.Yngwie's licks sounded mostly the same,and the three man jams were EXTREMELY loud.",5,The best,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",0.9875

Viewing this made me feel like I was on the front row! And the most amazing thing (besides the music) is that sells for just 10 bucks! Absolutely the wisest 10 bucks I've ever spent! I give it 15 stars!Some may think this is a contest to see who is the best but I don't look at it that way. SATRIANI, JOHNSON, AND VAI each bring something unique to the concert. G-3 LIVE IN CONCERT is a 3 song live playing of each artist and then they all jam together at the end in complete rapport and friendship. You can tell they all respect each other alot. The running time is 75 minutes of &quot;glued to your seat&quot; entertainment! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT!Here are the songs in order: SATRIANI plays 1) Cool No9 2) Flying In A Blue Dream and 3) Summer Sky. The second is my favorite. JOHNSON plays second. His songs are 1) Intro Song 2) Manhattan and 3) SRV (Which is dedicated to the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughn.) The second is my favorite. VAI plays last. His songs are 1) Answers 2) For The Love Of God and 3) The Attitude Song. Again the second song is my favorite.&quot;THE JAM SONGS&quot; (FEATURING ALL 3 G-3'S) are: 1) Going Down 2) My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama and 3) Red House (in honor of the late, great Jimi Hendrix.) The third song is my favorite.I highly and whole-heartedly recommend this videotape--incredible sound, very entertaining, diverse, and fun to view. You will not be disappointed; trust me!

16,A2JEONEOLE4FD2,738900370,Subash S L slsubash,"[0, 0]",Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.
