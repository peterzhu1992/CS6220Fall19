The narrator does a fine job, though she's no Carl Sagan. I had enjoyed it about as much as The Astronomers with Richard Chamberlain because, like that other series, you see first hand what the scientists have studied and discovered. The visuals add much realism to what they are explaining, something which the viewer will appreciate. Many of those techniques, unfortunately, were not available when Sagan made his Cosmos series. But Sagan, who was a much more lively teacher than any of the other astronomers on The Planets, appears only briefly in a couple of clips made years before the series was made. And when the other scientists appear so often you sometimes wish that they would talk less about and show us more of the celestial wonders that they marvel at. Still, if can you look behind them, there is much to impress you on the screen.I haven't seen the original BBC version, although that would require a different DVD player. It looks like the BBC tailored this version for American viewers, which is understandable since they wanted sell the series to A & E, an American cable network. However, as is true of more recent documentaries such as Planet Earth (the BBC version), the documentaries seem better because they aren't restricted to the format of the U.S. cable industry. The BBC's audience in Britain may be quite different in its tastes than those who watch the cable networks here in America. So perhaps to our disadvantage, there is less in the American edition about astronomy in other other parts of the world such as Russia and even Great Britain. I would have liked to have seen Patrick Moore from The Sky at Night, one of Britain's leading astronomers, but I don't recall that he ever made an appearance.

21,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,767020553,K. Harris Film aficionado,"[1, 1]","A co-production between the Arts and Entertainment network and the BBC, The Planets was essential viewing upon its release in 1999. Before the proliferation of TV networks geared toward science, nature, documentaries, and everything else in the universe--this was as comprehensive a look at our solar system as was ever put on television. Twelve years later, the series may be showing some signs of its age and may, in parts, seem dated. However, as television history as well as a fascinating look at a world beyond earth, this is still an invaluable viewing experience. Many of the segments could appropriately be utilized in introducing the solar system to a new generation of aspiring scientists and students. So I hope this reissue raises awareness of the program and finds new viewers.The program is broadcast in eight episodes over four discs. Besides the requisite interviews with contributors from every field of science and space exploration, the series focuses on the technology and personnel that have driven the space programs. I particularly admired that it viewed the phenomenon on a global scale. Not only do we see the American space endeavors and the impact of NASA, but there is also time spent looking at issues from the vantage point of the Russian program. It is solid history and the chronology of historical events is documented well.But when you look at something called The Planets or study the solar system--of course, the primary selling point comes from the visuals. This documentary series gives you a veritable feast for your eyes thanks to the available technology to unlock space's deep mysteries. History, science, technology, personal triumph, and even talk of extraterrestrials--it's all here. Engaging and informative, this is an easy recommendation for anyone even remotely interested in the topic. But even if you aren't a space enthusiast, there is much to learn from this presentation and much to be entertained by. However, if you already own the series in an earlier DVD incarnation--I would not opt for a repurchase. This is NOT loaded with new bonus features or added content which is a shame really. But, I suppose, with advances in the last twelve years--it might just be easier to come up with an entirely new and updated series. Now there's an idea!

If you've kept up with planetary astronomy the technical level is probably too basic for you, but for me, being about 30 years out of date, it was fine. I actually took a planetary geology course as a junior in college years ago (one of the few offered in the U.S. at the time, and it was fun). But I was woefully out of date and didn't know the new advances.A few comments on individual episodes:I especially enjoyed the episode on the moon, with all the old archival footage of the manned Apollo and also the Russian unmanned missions to the moon, which scooped up soil and sent it back to earth, which were sort of over-shadowed by the Apollo achievement.In the episode on the gas giants and the outer planets, some of the Voyager and Cassini-Huyghens discoveries were truly amazing, such as 1000+ mile an hour winds on Neptune and also the first discovery of an active volcano elsewhere in the solar system on its moon, Triton. These winds were faster even than those on Jupiter and Saturn. The surface of Triton is so cold (-235 degrees Celsius) that during the winter nitrogen freezes, coating the planet in white nitrogen snow, which then thaws during the summer. In many ways the Neptune and Triton discoveries were the biggest surprise of all.The episode on the sun, showing the discovery of coronal mass ejections and its powerful magnetic fields, was also very interesting. The solar helioscope photography (I assume taken from Hubble) was truly spectacular, showing the solar flares erupting along magnetic lines of force, the sun's atmosphere or corona, and the coronal mass ejections which can occur at velocities of up to 800 kilometers per hour.The series focuses mainly on the history and geology of the planets, rather than astrobiology, so if geology isn't your thing, this set probably isn't for you. But I don't think you have to be a mineralogist or hard rocker to enjoy it. But one episode does cover the prospects for life on other planets, mainly Mars--which apparently is looking better all the time.I note one reviewer didn't like all the talking heads, or all the interviews, but after all it's a documentary (and many of these scientists and project directors were getting up there in years but still mentally with it), and it was interesting to hear things from the horse's mouth, so to speak.Overall just a great series with awesome historical footage, spectacular planetary and solar photography, and good coverage of all the planets (except Pluto, which is the only one that wasn't featured, but since it's probably a captured asteroid, probably no big deal).",5,Spectacular & entertaining,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",0.5314

Well...a little more, maybe. I recently watched a documentary called Roving Mars - which chronicles the missions of two robotic probes sent there. RM is a perfect example of a fantastic documentary for several reasons: The narrative is well written and inspiring, the narrator(s) are great, the computer-generated graphics are absolutely mind-blowing (and spot-on accurate in every detail BTW), and the score written for the film works with it to really captivate and move you. Unfortunately, all of the things I just mentioned are a tad bit lacking in The Planets. The narrative is pretty much just the facts - which are good facts, to be sure. Still, the narrative reminds me of the type heard in those 60's and 70's movies shown in grade school (I'm 48). As far as the narrator, she comes across as simply someone hired to read an informative script (there are other, more ispired talking heads throughout). The graphics vary from great down to slightly dated. Not to shabby, but nothing compared to the stuff offered in Roving Mars (if you're into asronomy and haven't seen RM, trust me, you need to pick it up). I guess I was just hoping to have the kind of documentary I would want to watch repeatedly, and for me that says it all. I have quite a few space documentaries, such as RM, Nova's To the Moon, and David Sington's In the Shadow of the Moon to name a few, and I enjoy watching those again and again. Once I was done with The Planets however, I had the feeling it might be a while before I watched it again. But hey, I'm a tough critic and most people will likely enjoy this just fine.

One is that there is very little bonus material on the DVDs. But given how stunning these documentaries look on my 15-year-old TV, this is not much of an issue for me. Secondly, the narrater could have been a bit more enthusiastic about the material. (Perhaps I am spoiled by Carl Sagan's enthusiastic Cosmos.)

It contains many, many interviews with the 'movers and shakers' in solar system exploration and interpretation. There is also an enormous amount of wonderful original footage illustrating the text, and extremely well produced computer graphic imaginary to show things for things for which no footage exists or to set the 'atmosphere' of excitement that is part and parcel of working on what is often the cutting edge of human knowledge of the universe we live in.This DVD well deserves every one of its five stars. (I'd particularly recommend getting the acompanying book too, and working through both book and DVD together. The book contains a wealth of extra information and illustrations that perfectly compliment the DVD.)",5,Possibly the best documentary series of the 1990's,979084800,"01 10, 2001",0.5426
