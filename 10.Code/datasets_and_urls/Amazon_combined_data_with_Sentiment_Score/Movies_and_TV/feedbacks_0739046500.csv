0,A18BD98SU49UB7,739046500,Adam Hunnicutt A.H.,"[29, 45]","Melissa Cross has just broken a new boundary that is over a decade in the making: Rage 101.Her motivations seem sincere. Her intentions are to teach the up and coming youth, and in some cases established singers, how to sing raging/screaming vocals without shredding their vocal chords. Thats always good. Friends have asked for years how vocalists scream for three hours a night, a couple hundred times a year, and still have enough voice remaining to order a pizza on friday. Well, here's the answer.Melissa has spanned her advice and techniques over two discs, and cover every aspect of the artform. Art? Yes. For those of you scratching your heads, Emotional (Emo) Hardcore with its stark contrasts of harsh realities and sweet essences creates some of the most moving bits of music you'll ever hear. As Melissa points out, a great scream is one which covers every frequency in the spectrum, from thrashing highs to rumbling lows, all coherant.Many associate screaming vocals with untallented hipsters cowling in their mothers basement, churning out pointless discs of noise. Not true my friend. Here are a few discs you should check out: Skillet: Collide Emery: the weaks end Slipknot: Volume 3. and any System of a Down disk. There are literally thousands of examples out there. These vocals are sometimes scattered throughout the music world, even in places where they wouldn't be expected. Maybe you know a few? On the same note, there are those who have other preferences in music, thats fine too. To each his own.The Zen of Screaming is a tool for the future generation who pour their feelings upon scattered papers, bursting their internal furies of love, life and experiences into the ears of willing listners.(PS - Huge thanks to Melissa Cross on her feedback for my review. Hope things continue to flourish for you!)",5,In your car... In the Forest... On the Stage,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",0.1004
1,A1MQT9DYCXXXK2,739046500,Jabberwock,"[2, 2]","The Zen of Screaming is, as other reviewers indicated, largely Cross promoting herself. She uses her own, local students in the DVD, and they continually give testimonials about how wonderful Cross is. But if you can get beyond Cross' annoying self-promotion and talent-free clients, you'll find she really does have something to teach.The DVD is worth watching once, just for drill. The CD of vocal exercises really is valuable and could have easily stood on its own. The techniques aren't new, but do remind singers how to access more power without damaging their vocal chords or fighting chronic laryngitis (my personal problem).I taught drama for decades and recommended Born To Sing by Howard Austin and Elizabeth Howard to my students. In those days it was simply an audio cassette of vocal exercises, but is now a complete and extremely comprehensive package. If you're beginning or have never studied voice, try Born To Sing first!The whole Zen Of Screaming package really is overpriced, so if you can get it used, all the better. You probably won't watch the DVD more than once anyhow.",3,Not For Beginners,1238630400,"04 2, 2009",0.2484
2,A3V5O5G3I1T2NX,739046500,Mike,"[2, 2]","READER ALERT: If you order this, please make sure the copy you order comes with the companion CD. The DVD has the exercises, but the CD has them to fit voice ranges (tenor, baritone, and bass for men, soprano, mezzo-soprano, and contralto for women.) New copies should have it automatically, so check with the seller if you get one used.So I watched the DVD and it is very comprehensive. The first 15 or so minutes do feature a lot of musicians praising Ms. Cross and going on about why her techniques work. One you pass that, then you start getting into exercises, first the physical exercises and then the musical ones. Each follows the format of Ms. Cross demonstrating the exercise, then having a guest (either a student or a professional musician) demonstrate the exercise, and then commentary from pro musicians as to why the exercises are effective.Was there a lot of emphasis on actual screaming? No, but you have to learn to crawl before you walk, and there's way, way, way too much information on this disc to discredit it for not featuring more on screaming. I ordered the second disc so I'll let you all know if that contains more information on screaming (it was advertised that it should, so...)Otherwise, this is a must-have for any vocalist who's trying to be in ANY group where the music is amplified. I've received classical training before, but there's a lot on this disc that I wish I would have known before. I can't wait to apply it and I hope everyone finds success in using this CD.CREDITS:Special hats-off to Randy Blythe from the band Lamb of God, who dedicated a lot of time and his own embarrassing moments for the betterment of musical education. Support LOG by seeing them live!If you live in the Southwest United States, I ordered both discs from --movieweb-- and they arrived faster than anything I've ever ordered over the internet before. I recommend that seller to all!",4,"Would have liked more screaming, but otherwise VERY comprehensive (4.5/5 Stars)",1227571200,"11 25, 2008",0.2711
3,A1G8A06VFGVKQW,739046500,music guy,"[0, 3]",I believe in fact there are several techniques covered in this DVD set that are not traditional methods and things that a trained vocalist can use. It's all about the teacher I think and the way the information is related. I almost failed history in high school because although the content was there the way it was presented was not effective. Melissa seems to grab your attention and explain techniques effectively.,4,Well done,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",-0.0591

7,A3TBMAWIIHKHFN,739046500,Willie V. Hughes,"[24, 28]","I bought this DVD after hearing a great story about Melissa Cross on NPR a few weeks ago. The value of the DVD is excellent because you can actually see how the exercises need to be performed, as well as hearing them. I also liked watching Melissa because she's very colorful and dynamic, and it makes you feel like you have your own vocal coach. How someone can learn to sing from a book is beyond me. The DVD also features actual footage of vocal chords in action. Melissa apparently swallowed a tiny camera and sang the correct and incorrect ways. It's very interesting to see the theory in action.The package also comes with an audio CD that features warm-up exercises in different vocal ranges. A very nice addition. The production value of the whole package is excellent. I have seem some obvious vocal lesson scams on the internet that look like they were produced in someone's basement in an afternoon. This package is very professional, and contains a lot of content.The three drawbacks I have to this package (and the only two reasons I gave it four stars instead of five) are as follows: (1) There is too much promotional information on the DVD. Throughout the entire video, various band members interviewed in clubs and back alleys keep singing the praises of Melissa and telling you how great she is. I felt a little like, Hey, I already bought the DVD, you don't need to sell me on it. Get on with the program! (2) The video was a little too focused on death metal and hardcore garbage-disposal vocals. I was hoping there would be more discussion of the styles of say Joe Cocker, Bruce Springsteen, or Steven Tyler (Aerosmith). Although I can see that death metal singers are probably the most aggressive, they don't have a monopoly on singing with passion, fire and heat (as the video calls the techniques). (3) Ironically, The Zen of Screaming didn't cover as much screaming as I wanted. It seems like only the last chapter of the DVD really focused on what I bought the video for: How to sing aggressively without hurting your vocal chords. The vast majority of the video was spent on essential fundamentals (which were no doubt important), but I could have used another 10-15 minutes of discussion on how the heat and fire techniques really works.Overall, I would highly recommend this program. Hopefully the minor kinks in of the concept presentation will be worked out in future editions.",4,"Excellent, with a few drawbacks",1146268800,"04 29, 2006",0.225
