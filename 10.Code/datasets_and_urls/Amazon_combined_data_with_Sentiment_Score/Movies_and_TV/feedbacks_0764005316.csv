I was able to tape two of the episodes on a repeat, but I'm holding out hope (most likely in vain) for a DVD release. And Diana Rigg's introductions on the Mystery version add lots of background and period information about some of the real people some of the characters resemble. I assume that this comentary is not included on the VHS release (?).Police Superintendent Albert Tyburn has left England and Scotland Yard for the East African colony of Kenya. He left under a cloud and rumours about why have followed him all the way to Nairobi. He's to head up the newly created Criminal Investigations unit that pompous snob and windbag Police Commissioner Burkitt feels is entirely unnecessary. For Tyburn, crime is crime and people are people and his determination to treat the natives with respect along with his refusal to show his betters proper deference is a continual irritant to his often lofty suspects. He's also constantly irritating his superior, Burkitt who loathes Tyburn and tells him you're not one of us and you never will be - for which Tyburn is eternally grateful! Trevor Eve is fantastic as Tyburn - smart, sexy, wry and sardonic he has no qualms about being unpopular as long as the criminals pay.Then there's aviatrix Emma Fitzgerald (played by the terrific Susannah Harker) an independent woman on the fringe of polite society who pilots her own plane for safaris and supply runs. She and Tyburn meet when her sister is murdered in episode one. Their mutual respect and friendship evolves into one of the most understated (but sweet) romances I've ever seen!Great, tight stories, an authentic period atmosphere and wonderful supporting characters in Dr Mueller, Inspector Valentine, Corporal Karendi, Governor Rex Willoughby, decadent party-boy Chico DeVille and the sleazy and villainous Max Van der Vuerst all add up to intelligent and enjoyable viewing.

The writing is passable; the plots are complex and often difficult to follow, and the political correctness is hard to swallow. Heat of the Sun is not among the great British detective films (Gently, Frost, Morse/Lewis, Foyle), but it is consistently entertaining and worth your time. Especially if you like happy endings. Eve and Harker really click.The problem with the series is the packaging. The box, after listing the stars, tells you only that there are three films in the series. Each disc lists the titles on the spine of its jacket. Left unsaid is the fact that you can't fast forward anything. Well, you can but you can't get back to normal speed. The purpose of this is to force you to watch commercials, silly teasers, and repetitive and zombie-like introductions by Masterpiece Theater hostess Diana Rigg. Worse, no one tells you that each story is divided into two parts on each disc. And there is no way to reach the second half without slowly going through everything that precedes it!

5,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,764005316,C. O. DeRiemer,"[18, 18]","London Police Detective Albert Tyburn (Trevor Eve) may have taken justice into his own hands. He tracked down an influential, wealthy member of parliament, a pedophile, in the act of abusing an 11 year old boy. The man taunted Tyburn that he couldn't be touched, and then pulled out a pistol and took a shot. He missed. Tyburn took out his pistol, took careful aim and deliberately killed the man. For his act, Tyburn was told he had two choices. Resign from the police or accept a new position of police superintendent in Nairobi, about as far from London as his superiors could send him.So in 1931 Tyburn arrives in Kenya to take up his new post. His superior, Police Commissioner Burkitt (Michael Burne), is a red-faced martinet of the old school, dedicated to upholding the empire and not stepping on the toes of our class. Tyburn quickly finds that Nairobi's upper class is a privileged mix of wealth, condescension, bigotry, drugs, adultery, alcoholism and occasional buggery. Enforcement of the law is designed to keep the lower classes in their place. Tyburn has his work cut out for him.Heat of the Sun is a well made and well acted series of mysteries which take place in a much different time and setting than we're used to. Trevor Eve plays Tyburn as an experienced cop who is not impressed by the upper classes and doesn't mind pushing things if that's what it takes to find a criminal. Eve is a strong actor and is no pretty boy. He's a bit on the beefy side, and looks like he'd be more comfortable downing a beer than sipping a martini. The series is made up of three mysteries: Private Lives, which establishes Tyburn in Nairobi and puts him in the midst of murder and adultery amongst the elite; Hide in Plain Sight, where he goes up against a kidnapping ring; and The Sport of Kings, where Tyburn takes on a bigoted press lord and finds more secrets than he bargained for.In my view, the setting, the time frame, the acting, and the prodding of the privileged make this an enjoyable show. Unfortunately, while it was reasonably popular when shown in the U.S., it made much less of an impression in Britain. A second set of three mysteries was never commissioned. If you want to see Trevor Eve's range as an actor, watch him in The Politician's Wife. He plays the politician, and is charming, reprehensible and a liar.There's not much by way of extras.

From the opening shot in the afternoon sun along the famous railroad the British built across Kenya to the closing sunset, this film (three reels)is fabulous. The photography is stunning--out of Aftica. The characters are brilliant, from Albert Tyburn (Trevor Eve) to Ronald Burkitt (Michael Byrne) to Emma Fitzgerald (Susannah Harker). You will love them, or love to hate them, but you will never forget any of them. There are many old favorite actors and new young actors previously seen in many BBC productions.Tyburn has &quot;disgraced&quot; himself as a police officer in London by taking the life of a pediphile killer who was above the law because of diplomatic immunity. He is sent to Kenya in lieu of prison, where he becomes the Kenyan version of the Canadian Mountie. The time is that idyllic space between wars when Kenya was a British colony filled with ne'er-do-wells and other Eurotrash, plus a few good people who have no other home having been raised there or exiled like Tyburn. Tyburn solves a number of crimes, some of them horrendous, and finally asks Ms. Fitzgerald to dance. This is a love story too.Ms. Fitzgerald's character is loosely based on the avatrix Beryl Markham who flew &quot;West With the Night&quot; and became the first person to cross the Atlantic from Europe to North America--a much greater feat than that of Lindbergh as she flew against the jet stream.",5,Africa lovers tune this in...,959040000,"05 23, 2000",0.0918

It is Kenya during the years when it was crawling with British ex-pats and Tyburn (love the name) formerly of Scotland Yard has been exiled there due to a social faux pas. It seems he not so accidentally shot a well connected serial killer in England. (Can't have that, now can we?)In Kenya though, Tyburn is surrounded by an exaggeration of the worse of British society-- adultry, overuse of makeup (by a male character), casual cruelty and biogtry abound. It becomes not so much a question of who is guilty as who is guilty of this one particular crime.There is one scene that I just loved when Tyburn and his assistant call on two women who own a failing coffee plantation to ask their help in identifying an abused and terrorized native. Their exquisite good manners contrast sharply with the rather gauche behavior of their clearly out of practice hostesses. Definitely fun to watch.As for the name Happy Valley, it was the name given to part of the Kenyan Highland settled by white colonialists who for one reason or another preferred to live outside of England.

29,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,764005316,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 3]","Heat of the Sun (1999), is a British television series of crime dramas that unfold as police procedurals; it was made by Carlton TV and the American PBS (Public Broadcasting System) station WGBH (Boston). It was shown in the U.S. on public television's Masterpiece Mystery Theatre. The mystery series is set in the 1930's, between the wars, in Nairobi, Kenya, which was, at one time, a beautiful city in a beautiful country.An idealistic -- perhaps unrealistically idealistic-- former Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Albert Tyburn, (the handsome, sober and moody Trevor Eve,Waking the Dead - The Complete Season 1 and Pilot Episode) is sent to Nairobi to head a new criminal investigation unit; he had, back home, shot and killed a well-connected criminal of a particularly despicable sort, and was given a stark choice: Africa or the dole. Once in Africa, of course, he encounters an unusual number of murders. As he works to fight crime, he must also contend with the colonialist bigotry of the country's expatriate population. Eve's costar is the beautiful Susanna Harker, (Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)), playing Emma Fitzgerald, lovely local airplane owner/pilot. Michael Byrne plays the racist, royalty-worshipping Police Commissioner Ronald Burkitt. Sean Gallagher plays the as-outrageous-as-he-wants-to-be Chico DeVille. David Horovich is Doctor Emil Mueller. Cathryn Harrison is Charlotte Elliott. Fans of the series have waited a long, long time for the item to be released on DVD, but it finally has been. The box set contains the complete miniseries divided into three episodes on three disks. The episodes are:Private Lives. Emma's sister, Lady Daphne, has been killed; at first it is thought by a lion, which the locals are happy to blow to shreds. But then it becomes apparent that she has been murdered; to Burkitt's discomfort, evidently by a white.Hide in Plain Sight. In a plot that goes all over the place, it appears that local native girls are being brutalized, raped, killed, and disappeared. Odd things are happening at the local missionary station. The Prince of Wales is supposed to visit: Burkitt wants all the native prostitutes rounded up and jailed in his honor. Diana Quick (Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)) plays one of a pair of odd local sisters on a failing coffee plantation.The failing coffee plantation, of course, should ring a bell: it's what the Danish author Baroness Karen von Blixen-Finecke, n&eacute;e Karen Christenze Dinesen, best known by her pen name Isak Dinesen, wrote about in her wonderful, famous bookOut of Africa (Modern Library), which probably started the world's habit of dreaming of the romance of Africa. This habit was undoubtedly reinforced by Sydney Pollack's gorgeous, Oscar-winning movie of the same title,Out of Africa: 25th Anniversary (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)(1985) that starred Meryl Streep as Isak, Klaus Maria Brandauer as her husband Count Blixen, and Robert Redford as the glamourous British flyboy, Denys Finch Hatton, with whom she falls in love.The Sport of Kings. Joss Ackland,Queenie - (NTSC all regions), the South African villain du jour for at least a decade, stars as an immensely rich and powerful land owner who prides himself on his horses and beats a black stable boy to death.By the late 1990's, we know, the romance of Africa was well-established in the public mind. The process had been helped by two more influential books, also set in the 1930s, and the movies based upon them, released in the 1980s.White Mischief, The Murder of Lord Errollby the British journalist James Fox, was based on the true story of a murder that occurred in what was known as Happy Valley. That was an area within the White Mountains, which were known for their marvelous mild climate, where most of the ex-pats, remittance men all, whom their families were willing to pay to stay well away, settled. This was followed by the movie of the same title, (White Mischief (DE) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Germany]) 1987), starring Joss Ackland, once again, as a millionaire superannuated lord who, in 1940, on the eve of World War II, takes his comely young wife, Greta Scacchi, to Happy Valley - where she finds the local ex-pats at play, and meets Charles Dance. Sarah Miles co-starred.West with the Night, by Beryl Markham, a friend of Isak Dineson's. Beryl, a dashing female aviatrix, on whom Emma Fitzgerald was undoubtedly based, was a famous woman in her time, known for her aerial accomplishments and adventures. She had been raised in colonial East Africa by her father (as Fitzgerald is supposed to have been), hunted with the Maasai tribe, bred thoroughbred horses, also romanced Denys Finch-Hatton, defied constraining social rules, and finished her life as an African horse breeder and trainer. A television movie, now undeservedly buried in obscurity, calledShadow on the Sun [VHS](1988) was made of this material, starring Stefanie Powers, Claire Bloom, and Peter Bowles.Many of the most important events in the series occur in the pink-walled Muthaiba Club. This too, reflects the reality of Africa as it was then: Markham and Dinesen both met Finch-Hatton at the famous Kifaru Club, on which it is based; and Markham got married there twice. The mini series also bears the proud hallmarks of British TV at the time, clothes and cars are spot on, and Emma's plane is a jazz age hoot.It appears that this series was an original creation, not based on any book, though it was surely influenced by the three cited above. Occasionally, the mysteries are a bit much, but they are shot through with humor, and are certainly set in an interesting place and time. Africa looks beautiful. It seems obvious that the expense of location filming on that continent caused there to be only the first series. Never mind, if you dream of that continent in color, but can't afford a visit, this set is much more reasonably priced.",5,"The Romance of Africa, When It Was Romantic",1296259200,"01 29, 2011",0.0831

While there were some differences in my experiences...(my time was in the '70s) the vast majority of the series brings back many memories....I could completely identify with the main character when confronted with a matter involving superstition...
