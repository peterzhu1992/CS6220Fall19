My brother bought it for Playstation on a whim, having never either played or heard of Myst (I still haven't played it), and I played the game alongside him, both of us consulting the walkthrough the whole time (something I now do not condone, but we were young - what do you expect?), and thoroughly enjoying it. We had hours of fun playing it over and over, memorizing the steps, the scenes, and every instance of the number 5.This game started my love for everything Myst related, and made me realize that I can play video games too. Until seeing this game, I thought that all video games required finger dexterity and quick reflexes, neither of which do I have.Sure, it may not be the best as far as graphics when compared to newer games, and may not have the three-dimensionality of subsequent Myst games and many newer games, but it still holds a magical quality and the storyline can't be beat. This game is a true classic, and everyone who plays adventure games should play it.

If you like to feel like you accomplished something, this is the game for you.It's predecessor Myst was excellent preparation for the type of game this is. There is no &quot;Action&quot; per se, just clues and objects to work through. You don't get killed, you don't get points. You do however get an appreciation for how intricate details can be interlinked.Imagine that you end up in a land, where you have to put together the pieces to figure out what happened. This is both Myst and Riven.If you play Myst first, it will help you understand what this is all about. I recommend it highly. It will give you a sense of what you are looking for and why. Myst was a land where you realized that two brothers had done something and were trapped in books for their efforts. Their father and mother also were elsewhere and looking for one another and had left clues in this same area. Your assignment is to piece together, what happened and use your gut feel on how to act in regards to that. There are in fact 4 possible endings to Myst.In my opinion and from what I have seen at home, unless you have a very analytical child, this will not hold their interest. This is an adult game and not from the perspective that you are protecting the child. I honestly think this would be an excellent assignment for a child to hone their thought processes on. However the lack of action and need for real thinking most children will think of as work, not fun.Put on your thinking caps and dive in.I'm waiting for the next one.",5,A thinking game,967593600,"08 30, 2000",0.1365
3,A3ME62ZG7A27KD,B00000JL6V,Aussiemystic aussiemystic,"[0, 0]","Riven is a worthy followup to Myst and still must rate as one of the alltime great adventure games.Those familiar with the Myst series will know some of what to expect: lush visuals (although in static form, no 360 rendering), a detailed storyline, fiendishly clever puzzles, much mysterious machinery, and a need to respond to and interact with the environment in order to solve the game.There are some important differences to the Myst series. First of all, rather than exploring a number of different worlds, or 'ages', in Riven you explore one (albeit large) world, comprised of five islands. There are links to two other 'ages' but these are very sketchily developed and there is not much to explore here. There are some differences between the islands, but the radically different tones of the ages in Myst or Myst III is missing.This has its advantages and disadvantages. The world you explore is much larger, and you can progress over virtually the whole world without needing to solve many puzzles, allowing even a casual player a good glimpse at the world of Riven.However, it also means that the puzzles are less contained and linear than in the other Myst games. As well as a number of smaller puzzles, there are two major puzzles to be solved, clues for which are scattered throughout the islands. Even with the smaller puzzles, the control to open a vital door might be located a long distance away, or only accessible via a very circuitous route. This can add another degree of complexity to the puzzles. Having said that, there is a degree of logic to most of the controls which are based on the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of Riven. The puzzles generally also operate in a logical manner and relate well to the entire environment of the game.There is little action for the punch-em-up enthusiasts - but they're unlikely to be reading the review anyway.In summary, a fantastic game that will engross you for hours - I just wish more alternative ages could have been included.",4,Astonishing journey to a fantasy world,1065571200,"10 8, 2003",0.3356
4,A2JJSCIGPZDWHI,B00000JL6V,BENJAMIN MILER,"[3, 4]","I tell you this, the creators of Riven sure did their homework in the four year gap between the original Myst and Riven. The graphic improved drastically, meaning whatever computer you were running the original Myst in '93/'94 (Myst first appeared on the Mac in '93, then the PC the following year) would probably not be adequate to run Riven. Certainly Myst had made even greater improvements in the graphics department since Riven, like the 360 degree panning feature for Myst III: Exile, and even more photo-realistic graphics and animation for Myst IV: Revelation, but even for 1997 standards the graphics to Riven still hold up, although it's rather obvious the graphics looks a little more pixelated during some of the animated scenes (like when you take a ride on the cable car, probably to keep the animation fast without slowing it down for the computers of the time). But for the most part, the graphics seem so realistic you almost feel like you're there. Of course the big pain is this game consisted of 5 CD-ROM discs, which you have to swap every now and then, it's too bad they didn't have an install feature where you could install all five discs on to hard drive and only need to use one disc to play the game (like the much maligned Schizm: Mysterious Journey, a game from Poland that's very much like Myst, which had five discs in the CD-ROM version, and you had the option for full install so you didn't have to keep swapping discs).It's agreed by most everyone that Riven is more difficult to solve than the original Myst. The puzzles often don't seem obvious, and there are some puzzles that can be frustrating, like the marble puzzle, which you have to solve in order to gain access to the domes found on Riven. Or the animal puzzle, which you'll find a bunch of stones in this one room with animal symbols that you have to push in the right order to go to another world. On the original Myst, after you won it, Atrus tells you that his wife Catherine has been taken prisoner, and on Riven, you're supposed to find and free his wife, taken prisoner by Atrus' father, Gehn. Also it looks like a different guy was playing Atrus on Riven from the original Myst, in fact it was none other than Myst creator Rand Miller who plays Atrus on Riven (as well as Myst III and IV, though I hadn't played Myst V, so I can't tell you about the game or the characters), although I'm uncertain who played Atrus on the original Myst. I really love the ambient music that goes with this, not to mention the beautiful scenery found throughout.Although a bit tricky in places, you're certain to enjoy this game if you're in to Myst.",5,Second great installment in the Myst saga,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",0.5313

Every scene is elaboratly detailed and very pleasing to the eye. The sounds and music are much better and sound even more realistic. They also have added more animation. You see more things moving around that makes it seem like you are more involved in the game. They have also added some very cool features such as a roller coaster type vehicle that lets you travel from island to island and a submarine used to travel underwater. The game play is much the same as Myst, but sometimes you have to go to one area and do some things to complete a puzzle in another area. You also have to learn the Riven math system to solve other puzzles which I thought was a cool idea.

13,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00000JL6V,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","Given the success of Myst, a sequel was inevitable. Riven is both a sequel in spirit and in its story. The game takes place just after Myst and takes the player to another age where you meet Atrus' father and wife, amongst others. As in Myst, the story is told through journal entries, puzzles, and a few cinematic scenes. Riven does develop the story more than Myst did, with more cinematic cutscenes and longer books. Overall, I think this is a great addition and the actor who plays Ghen (Atrus' father) is actually quite good.Like Myst, Riven is a challenging puzzle game. Overall, the game isn't quite as challenging as Myst because the relationship between the puzzles and solutions aren't as attenuated. However, there are a few cases where I felt like I knew what information I needed, but didn't know where to find it. This is particularly problematic in a point-and-click game with limited movement. I was particularly frustrated with learning the Riven numbers - I knew I needed to in order to learn a code, but couldn't figure out where to get the translation! Also, there is one thing in the very last puzzle which is a real pain - something impossible to see that needs to be moved.The graphics in Riven look beautiful, even 15 years later. The Riven environment is gorgeous and has some really startling landscape. However, the geography in Riven is supposedly 5 times larger than Myst's, but because most of the game occurs within a single Age is actually does feel a bit smaller. Moreover, I felt like there were more corridors, or areas that had no function other than to serve as space between two other areas. Myst by contrast was extremely compact. I'm not sure which is better, but I'd guess that in terms of puzzle content the two games were about equal. I would have preferred a bit more environment and fewer corridors.Ultimately, Riven is a worthy sequel to Myst and follows its predecessor closely. If you like Myst, you'll probably love Riven.

I played many hours at a time and while a lot of the game is crazy difficult (don't get me started on the D'ni numbers) it is still a lot of fun. Let me repeat: the puzzles in this game are HARD they are time consuming, and they seem not to make sense.This is NOT for everyone and only for people with a lot of patience and I would say, avid computer gamers, and avid computer games who can appreciate slow, methodical, thinking games that do offer entertainment and beautiful graphics and music. There is some violence and character interaction, but this is by far no Halo Resident Evil or Gears of War.

But &quot;Riven&quot; more than met that task. In fact, &quot;Riven&quot; so surpasses &quot;Myst&quot; in scope, storyline and task that it's almost boggling.The game opens with you returning to D'Ni again after transporting through the linking book in the Library on Myst Island. The ever-knowledgeable Atrus, played by Rand Miller, thanks you for coming back and says he needs your help. And from then the race is on: You need to find his wife Catherine who is trapped in a prison somewhere on the Riven Age. Her captor turns out to be Atrus' father, Gehn, a madman who wants to destroy his own son. Along the way, you encounter people, puzzles, awesome creatures (like Sunners and Wahrks), and dazzling special effects.Just like on Myst Island, the clues you discover on the five islands in Riven are what reveal the story to you. &quot;Riven&quot; is increasingly more complex than &quot;Myst&quot; in that regard. Everything is just bigger and, in my opinion, better. The graphics have improved tremendously; the Quicktime videos used for all the animations in the game are improved; the puzzles are harder and are more integrated into the storyline than ever before; and there is actually character interaction in this game - much more so than simply meeting people through Prison Books, like in &quot;Myst.&quot;&quot;Riven&quot; is definitely habit-forming. The first time I played it, I ended up just walking around and looking at everything before I decided to actually begin my journey on rescuing Catherine. When you step out into the open a few minutes after the real action begins, the sense of &quot;this is gonna be bigger and more immersive than Myst&quot; sets in.I cannot say enough positive things about &quot;Riven.&quot; I end up playing it more than &quot;Myst&quot; and have sometimes preferred it over &quot;Myst III: Exile.&quot; To say I am fascinated with everything on those five islands is an understatement.

The brilliantly realized environments and mood-setting soundtrack draw you in immediately and keep you there until the sun comes up. Riven is not for gamers with short attention spans--simply navigating and charting the accessible areas of the Age of Riven take patience and time, and solving what I would characterize as the two major puzzles requires all of the intelligence and tenacity one can muster. As some reviewers have said, having played Myst first is helpful background to have, but this is not because the puzzles of Riven are similar to those of Myst, but because Myst will acquaint you with how the creators conceive puzzles, and heighten your sensitivity to factors in the environment that bear noting and investigating. I gave Riven 4 stars, rather than 5, for two reasons: (a) one of the major puzzles is sound-based, and after some long and frustrating efforts at solving it on my own, I obtained some hints on the internet and found that the solution required matching up particular sounds from the game that, in fact, simply did not match up (at least not in the version that I bought); and (b) one other crucial clue is a tiny, blurry image. In these respects, I felt that the creators did not play fair. Two other points:(i) contrary to what some have said, it is indeed possible to lose this game and meet an untimely end, so be careful out there, and (ii) recognize that the CD-Rom version is on 5 discs, which need to be changed every time you travel from one world to another--if you have a DVD-Rom player, by all means spring for the DVD version, which consists of one disc.",4,A Worthy Effort,947289600,"01 8, 2000",0.2604

However my computer would not allow me to hit a certain switch for some reason, and I was therefore never able to get to the location on the cover. Even if I had, I would never play the game again, I would know how to do everything, and therefore, what would be the point? At least it is better then Myst in which you can win within about 15 minutes of starting the game, but still... Any 60 dollar game (as it was when it was released) should last longer than this. With the detail put in, the game itself is rather short, with puzzle solving accounting for much of your time. Also some puzzles can be so frustrating when you know what to do, but can't (the stopping the scopes thing, the puzzle at the top of the dome on the first island). I thought it was a beautiful game, but I wouldn't get it unless it is below 20 dollars, otherwise I don't really think it's worth it.",3,"Well, it's better than Myst",1096502400,"09 30, 2004",0.3301

Sound effects and music approach perfection.2. Gameplay is wonderfully balanced. You are never bored, and only occasionally frustrated by the harder puzzles. All the puzzles are logical, and give you a great feeling of accomplishment when you solve them. There is a vast area to explore while you are figuring things out. You turn a corner, and startle mysterious creatures who are sunning themselves on a rock. You climb up another path, turn, and the view makes you gasp.3. Riven creates a fantasy world that is alien; yet it evokes a sense of reality that is, in my experience, unparalleled in computer gaming. I wish I could find a way to live in Riven.Cons:1. If you like exploring new worlds by dashing through them and shooting things, you may find that the pace of this particular game is too slow.2. While the storyline is intriguing, it is possible to nearly finish Riven before discovering the diaries that further explain the plot. I wish I had known more of the background of the story a little sooner in the game.3. Riven is so immersive that you forget the everyday world. Your children will wonder why you haven't cooked dinner. Your friends will speculate as to why you have stopped answering the phone. Your spouse will become jealous of your relationship with a computer game (easiest solution: play it together).Bottom Line: IMHO, this game is IT, the Numero Uno, the King.

The producers emulated Myst in almost every way but they decided to change one important thing: they made it more open-ended. In Myst, you start on a small island, told what to do (collect pages) and have unlock other areas to proceed. In Riven, you are dropped in large area of five interconnected islands with only the vaguest idea of what to do. To find your way on your own requires a meticulous manner and loads of free time. My advice is spend a reasonable amount of time then use a walkthough as needed.A technical note: I could not this running in Windows 2000. Riven requires Apple Quicktime 2 to run and after installing that I could get the sound to work. It may have a conflict between Quicktime 2 and Quicktime 6/iTunes also installed.

31,A1FKAMZL7SOF9P,B00000JL6V,Stormtrooper,"[0, 0]","I admittedly played Myst and was frustrated with it. I was so used to games giving you hints/directions so you knew where you had to go to progress the story. Myst broke that boundary and let you explore a world. I never finished it and only got maybe 30-35% through it before I stopped playing.When Riven came out, I initially brushed it off harking back to my Myst experience. Good reviews and in game screenshots of these lavish environments and devices made me want to try it, and I was not disappointed.Riven (at the time it was released) was the only game where I played the entire night, keeping a scratch pad next to my mouse so I could notate things I'd find (designs, shapes, items, even sounds as the guy at Ebgames said he recommended to). While still difficult in terms of puzzles and solving them, I found it easier to progress the story and move into the different time periods.There is a part where you need to remember particular sounds and replay them in order so you can proceed. This took me forever! I couldn't get it right even though I thought I remembered it. It truly tests your mind. Getting by that particular puzzle was very gratifying.In short, if you've played Myst (or even its sequels after Riven), give this one a shot.

All true. But I find people's devotion to Riven and its predecessor a bit overblown.There are design faults here that should be pointed out. The 'slide-show' effect when moving probably does allow sufficient computer memory for photo-realism while standing still, but it compromises the realism that the producers were otherwise attempting. Besides that, it's simply annoying. Some have said that it adds a certain elegance to movement throughout the game, but I don't like seeing my surroundings 'melt' away as I move through them. Nor do I like sterile, empty environments. Oh sure, it all adds to the 'creepy' vibe the producers were hoping for, but a universe which is largely uninhabited is mighty boring after a few hours. I wanted wayyyyy more interaction with people than I got here.I also wanted to understand why I was doing what I was doing. Oh I could solve the puzzles, given gobs of time and guesswork, but at the end I found the plot rather too spare for the amount of work invested. If I'm going to spend weeks solving puzzles, I better understand more at the end of the story than at the beginning. I'm not altogether sure that happens here. The universe here, for all of its graphical excellence, left me hungry for more. Clearly, this is an entertainment crafted by fine artists rather than fine writers. If you're happy with that orientation, you'll be overjoyed with the final product. But if, like me, you want a game to surround you with an active, vibrant plot revealed by characters of substance, Riven isn't much of an adventure.",2,Adventuring ain't for loners,947289600,"01 8, 2000",0.2321
33,AP3B615GM191G,B00000JL6V,Zachary Koenig K-Dawg,"[0, 0]","After the success of the original Myst game changed the landscape of computer gaming, its widely-awaited sequel created an even more engaging atmosphere. The only trouble? It is difficult to the point of giving up on far too many occasions.Basically, Riven follows the same point-and-click philosophy as its predecessor. You go around solving logic puzzles with the goal of saving Catherine (wife of age-writer Atrus) from the murderous Gehn.In terms of overall imagination and scope, Riven is, dare I say, easily the best of the Myst bunch. The puzzles are more engaging than Myst, and the game just has an epic feel to it. Every single different island, creature, or pathway one encounters in the game leads to an amazing discovery. At least at the outset, it is almost impossible to not get swept away by the atmosphere and become completely immersed in the gameplay.The problem? Here it is: After playing all the Myst games through as a teenager when they first came out, I decided to tackle them all again and review them on Amazon this time. Myst was a grand experience, and so was Riven...until you actually have to begin solving the the mystery of the Golden Domes (which leads in turn to the infuriating dot-matrix puzzle). The difficulty level gets to the point where one most devote countless hours (and probably even some sleepless nights!) to wrapping one's brain around the mysteries. Unless you are fully, 100% committed to the game, you will waver at this point.An easy fix for the difficulty problem would have been having the islands be a bit more accessible. Whereas in Myst the action took place in relatively enclosed spaces, Riven sprawls out over and incredibly large environment. Thus, a discovery on one island is prompted not only by the thought of I know what this does now, but also how the heck do I get back there?!. Not having to spend valuable time traipsing across the entire game would have ratcheted up the experience quite a bit (instead of dragging it down considerably).Finally, it is sad that (despite its shortcomings) this game has not received a stable release on current software platforms. Despite downgrading my QuickTime and trying any number of compatibility fixes, Riven would not run on Windows 7 without freezing up approximately every 10-15 minutes of gameplay. I'm not letting this issue affect my review of the actually gameplay itself, but just be warned that getting the game to work at all will be an out-and-out struggle.Overall, Riven is still a landmark PC that I truly hope gets an update for modern technology. It would be a shame to see such a fine game be relegated to the dustbin of history based only on outdated technology.",4,"Best Imagined Of All Myst Games, But Prohibitively Hard",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",0.1546
