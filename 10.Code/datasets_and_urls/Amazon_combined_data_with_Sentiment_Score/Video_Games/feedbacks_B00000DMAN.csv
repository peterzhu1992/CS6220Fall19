Myst and Riven don't have a main character that you are per se, whereas in this game, you have a name and a face.The game puts you in the shoes of one agent Craig Wilmore. He is put on a case to find the missing X-files staff: Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. As an X-files fan, I found this game very entertaining. As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games. There were hints, stuff to pick up, things to do etc. This was well within the capabilities of non-X filers and should be equally entertaining.I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast within and Phantasmagoria. Unlike Phantasmagoria, there were no gory scenes (of which I was thankful). The people were movies of real people and not cartoons. The dialgue though limited offered enough variability. One important point would be to save often. I got killed alot.The game had enough of a plot you could figure out what to do next. That is essential rather than blindly clicking on everything you could pick up.All in all a good buy. When's the next one?",5,"Great game, when is the next one",964656000,"07 27, 2000",0.1521

Scully &amp; Mulder have disappered and it's your job to find them. You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search. A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location, you have to do a real time search to catch the &quot;bad&quot; guys towards the end. Most of the cast members from the show are here (Skinner, The Cigarette Smoking Man, &amp; The Lone Gunmen), but they weren't used nearly enough. There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good, but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier (like being able to get a password for your own computer. Why was this so hard?). Overall, a good game, but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great game.",4,Pretty good game.,982022400,"02 13, 2001",0.1095
2,A116ZSMZRT9RUN,B00000DMAN,David Noelle Straylight,"[1, 1]","This was not the best mystery/adventure game I've ever played, and I'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with, but I am a serious X-Phile. Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode. Instead, it was more like being one of those &quot;other agents&quot; who make brief appearances two or three times per season. You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break. Of course, the up side to that is a more immersive, believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue.Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes, conspiracies, events, and trivia from various episodes, as well as the familiar faces. While it's not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery, it does add quite a bit to the game.If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there. If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan. On the other hand, if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series it's based on, you'll have a lot of fun with this game.",4,A good mystery game for X-Philes,1046822400,"03 5, 2003",0.2452
3,A2L375A8IWXEGI,B00000DMAN,Herve Bronnimann,"[10, 10]","We stopped watching the series (lack of time) and so this was a nice way to keep the excitement going. The game is good, perhaps a little disorienting at first. I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmore's desk, doing nothing :)Once you get the hang of it, though, it follows quite nicely. Because you have so much freedom in navigation (you decide where to go, but things won't happen until you come back to the right place at the right time), it feels like the game is non-linear. In fact, it is rather linear, although you have a few variations. I wasn't disappointed in the ending, but not thrilled either, it didn't blow me away. We got stuck a couple of times, but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a week.The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN. And organize your saves. Keep the last save before you change CDs (they correspond roughly to major developments). You might need to restart from there because you forgot to do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot something at the beginning of the game. But overall, the storyline is quite intuitive and you'll be fine if you make connections.Buy this game if you like the series but you're not a fanatic (you'd be disappointed). And you'll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn it into a challenge rather than into a frustration.",4,It's a good entertainment,966643200,"08 19, 2000",0.1446
4,A2W1PPFGSWYVZV,B00000DMAN,Stephen L. Cash Jr. crashman1977,"[4, 4]",I have had this game since 1999. I really enjoy playing it. I have been playing it again and again off and on for few years now. I just recently decided to play it again. So I installed it on my Windows 7 professional 32 bit version computer. After doing the following compatibility for it works just fine on windows 7 professional. Install the latest quick time do not install the version on the cd. Also during install it looks for hard drive space since this was during a time that hard drive was not very big it will say there not enough hard drive space just hit ignore it will continue with the install. If you have Windows 7 Professional 32 bit version all I did was click compatibility run under Windows XP(Service pack 3) and run this program as an administrator was all I checked. However if you have the windows 7 64bit version you will need to enable to run at the 32bit version level most likely.,4,X-files game review,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",0.0963
