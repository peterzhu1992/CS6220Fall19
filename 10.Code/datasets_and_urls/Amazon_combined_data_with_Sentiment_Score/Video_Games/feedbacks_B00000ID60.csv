You have to remember this is an old game now, but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it E. This game just came to late. It was still a fun game, but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked, but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date.",3,Crusin started a style all its own.,1275955200,"06 8, 2010",0.1792

This port though is really for the die hard fans of the arcade game it is based on because the good qualities of the game do not outweigh the bad qualities.The Good Qualities: This port includes all of the cars, stages and music featured in the arcade version. The controls are spot on so you were able to get into this game easily. It even includes the secret cars by hitting certain buttons at the select screen such as the bus.The Bad Qualities: This game was one of the first titles to be released soon after the Nintendo 64 made is debut and it shows. While the graphics are crisp and bright, they were also choppy at times during gameplay and this game was one of the first to feature massive pop up graphics: graphics that suddenly appeared out of thin air. While the arcade game suffered from this as well, it wasn't as bad and the overall draw distance was better than the N64 port. The digital voice samples along with the audio in the N64 port were muffled; it sounded like it was playing out a paper bag. The cars controlled in the same way so there was no difference in what you picked to play during the stages.If you were a fan of the Cruisin arcade series, be warned that this is a decent port of the first title in the series and like the first arcade game, had little variety in the control of the cars and the stages. I like arcade racers so that is why I give this a 3 star rating. Peace.",3,A decent port of the hit arcade title,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",0.4119
3,A351A8TEG9AI00,B00000ID60,DarthLuker Sam,"[0, 0]","I thought this game was actually very good for a racing game on the N64 so so early of a release. This is before alot of the other much better racing games came out and I was suprised to find such a fun game.However the game can get very anoying with the way the car crashes work out, some of the races are very repetitive and you really wont be finding any good bonus features that will make you excitited to play it after wards. The records of your times in races is erased every time you turn off your system, I'm not sure if that has something to do with a pack of some sort but it sucks.Still like I said earlier, this is an early title for the N64, you will be amazed at how well such a game so early is. Buy it if your into race games, ignore it if your looking for the best.",5,A fascinating game for the N64,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",0.6687

You start out with 7 cars: A type I don't remember, a lexus, a racecar, and using the cheat: A jeep, bus, and police car.At the beginning, a bikini babe waves the flag and you cruise down famous landmarks like San Fransisco or Grand Canyon, etc. It's high-speed action from there!

I however, think the Wii downloadable version has much better graphics and sound quality and the controls are easier on the Wii compatible Game Cube controller than the Nintendo 64 one. There are better racing games available but this is still one of the best old school racing games.",3,This game is good for it's time but the Wii virtual console version is much better.,1353456000,"11 21, 2012",0.8011

Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel. In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version, it really seems to be alright, but looks are always decieving. In the case of Nintendo 64, there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel. This isn't really one of them.The 1996 Crus'n U.S.A. game for Nintendo 64, seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel. The graphics are very strong, but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from, which is seven, not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game. Although the courses seem to be within detail, there are so many flaws, including th frame rate and the style of the game, especially within the tunnels of place like Washington D.C. Nevertheless, the game seem to be a little down and out, but at the time it came out for Nintendo 64, it was one of only two video racing games for the Nintendo 64.It is kind of dissapointing that they couldn't try to make some better video games with racing at the time, but there are so many better choices to the Nintendo 64. If you're really into the racing feel of the Nintendo 64, I suggest you either get Mario Kart 64, Rush 2, or the sequel to Crus'n U.S.A. : Crus'n World.",2,Not Behind The Checkered Flag,1048809600,"03 28, 2003",0.278

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,"[2, 2]","Note: This review is going to be short, since there isn't really much to say about the game.Cruis'n USA isn't actually as bad the averaged out Amazon rating says. There's some good arcade-style racing here. You may not be interested in this category if you like games like Mario Kart, but it's still a pretty good game. Granted, there are some pretty cheesy things that have been said in-game (Wow, so THIS is the Grand Canyon!), but you can get used to that easily.Another thing that some may complain about is that the game is short. You can beat the game in a little less than a half hour. But I don't care about how long a game is. It just needs to fit with its price...and boy, do you have a chance of buying a used copy for a few bucks.The game is like Rad Racer on the NES, but 10 times better. If you like games that are similar to Rad Racer, Ridge Racer, or maybe Need for Speed, then Cruis'n USA is definitely something to buy.",5,Want some good arcade racing?

9,A1ERDXS0QLEVKB,B00000ID60,rzaster,"[1, 2]","Unlike some other reviewers I actually found that this game was enjoyable. The only complaint I have is that the graphics looked like they belonged to a Super Nintendo. Besides that the game is awesome.The basic outline of the game is that you race the USA from California to Washington DC. Each level gets harder as you pass along but not to worry. Once you get the hang of the game you will beat the level after a few tries. Each time you complete the whole entire racee (California to D.C.) you will earn a faster car.So, all in all Crus n' USA is a pretty enjoyable game. Buy and enjoy.HAPPY GAMING!",4,Pretty Good,977529600,"12 23, 2000",0.3261
