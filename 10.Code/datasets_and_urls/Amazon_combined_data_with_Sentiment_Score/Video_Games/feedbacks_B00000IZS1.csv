Every character on each team has their own special moves, but the teams are all pretty well balanced, they all have a fast hero, a strong hero, and a hero that can fly.The grapics are great, fast and great! It has a great third person view, the camera is behind and above the team, you can move to either side, you can jump up, you can fall down, it's just a great 3D game!It's soo easy and plays smoth, my only complaint is it that it is too fast in some places, like in the giant loops I easily lose track of the Sonic, with him moveing from side to side he will run off a cliff and I won't notice it until he is dead",4,I Love This Game!

You still get the same high good-looking jumps and loop-de-loops,but the actual fighting is one of the best parts.You get excellent combo moves and on Team Dark and Sonic a nicely well-done finisher attack.All four teams have a finisher attack,but half of them are stupid. What really caught my eye is the two player battle mode.There is something about knocking a team off a cliff is entertaining to me.

5,A2290OIJTU42QP,B00000IZS1,Female Spy,"[3, 3]","Sonic Heroes is a lovely platformer. Lately I have been hearing people saying terrible things about this game, as well as other 3D Sonic platformers. Here is my message for them: WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?! It's true that Sega hasn't exactly perfected the camera system for this game as well as the other Sonic 3D games, but please give Sega some credit for this good platformer. To start with the good in this game, and there is a lot of it, the voice overs are totally sweet. I normally don't pay much attention to the voices of the characters, as they little interest me, but this game struck a cord there. Each voice, matches his or her corresponding character's personality, species, and gender perfectly! There is no question about it. The graphics are good, regardless of the very occasional jerky camera, and the video clips and the stories are also some of the best I have seen. How each story begins, collides with other stories, and ends is masterpiece, and unlike many other games, once you finish a story, you can watch all of the movie clips of that story in the options menu! The music totally rocks, especially the team themes, and the levels all have a good moral lesson for kids: that you need to work with others as a team! Speaking of team, this game is very team oriented, the teams are:Team Rose: which consists of Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit (and, as always, accompanied by Cheese the chao), and Big the Cat. This team has adventures that are beginner difficulty. This is good for young children, and getting beginners used to the game. You may also enjoy this team's cuteness.Team Sonic: this consists of Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles Tails Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna. This team has a journey that is a little harder, normal difficulty to be exact. This is good for those who want a little more of a challenge, and enjoy the light bantering of this somewhat humorous team.Team Chaotix: the members of this group include Espio the Chameleon, Charmy the Bee, and Vector the Crocodile (who is apparently The Head Honcho). This team's adventures have been dubbed dubious. The difficulty, in my opinion, varies from easy to hard. If you like detectives, mystery, and treasure hunting, this team is for you. Most of their missions consist of finding a certain amount of something (five keys for example). Not all of them, but most of them. My last comment on them is: this is easily the most comical team in the game. I have been set off laughing by a comment from these dudes several times. You should have fun with them.Team Dark: this team has Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, and Omega (who is an ex-eggman robot). The mercenaries of this team are shrouded in mystery. First off, I must comment that it's like a soap opera for children, that they brought Shadow back from his presumed death, and with amnesia included. This team has hard difficulty, and often makes you go farther in the levels than you would normally have to with other teams. This group would be extremely boring if it wasn't for Rouge. Shadow and Omega take things very seriously, which makes Rouges role the person who lightens things up. It's an interesting contrast of personalities.So, like I stated earlier, I believe it is good for children to see teams of all kinds. This basically teaches them you can team up with others, no matter how different they are, and work together on a task to make it easier. Moving on, Sega also brings the special stages to 3D. That's right, rather than collecting the emeralds in the storyline (like with the Sonic Adventure series) you actually have to collect a key, hightail it out of the level without getting hit, and complete a special stage in order to get a chaos emerald. Oh, and true to form, the last special stage is once again the hardest. There is also the Last Story that I will not go into detail here, but trust me, get all seven chaos emeralds and access it. It is definitely worthwhile. The only flaws I have to list for you is these:1. Because of all of the team action, each individual lost something move wise. I am talking about things like Knuckles' gliding and climbing abilities as well as Sonic's somersaulting. Big no longer fishes like he did in Sonic Adventure, and the flight characters (Tails, Cream, Charmy, and Rouge) cannot fly as long or fast as they originally could. Which sadly makes sense, seeing as those little things are carrying all of the weight of the rest of their teams. Their cool team moves make up for most of the lost abilities, but you still have to miss Knuckles' climbing skills in those tight situations.2. The flight members each have a special attack that they can do alone, but there is little point to them having it, seeing as they are almost never alone. So your stuck just doing thundershoot. While powerful, I do believe flying characters lack variety in their abilities.3. The camera doesn't operate 100% smoothly. It is slightly better than Sonic Adventure 2:Battle, and doesn't matter much anyway however.4. There isn't enough variety in the chaotix missions. It's always either find a certain amount of something, sneak past someone, or get from point A to point B before time runs out. I guess it would be difficult to make it more than that, but still, the missions lack that investigative thing that detectives do.5. There is no water to swim in. This isn't exactly a huge problem, but I did enjoy confronting and swimming in bodies of water the other games throw at you. Here, the only water you get is Seaside Hill and it behaves more like a bottomless pit. It would have been interesting to see how each team adapted to a swimming pool, and maybe see what funny thing Sonic would have to say.6. Finally, the zones are not as expansive. It just puts you on one path and makes you go forward. The advantage with this is that you can never get lost, but it loses that go wherever you want to charm.That's it. The 2 player mode is also great for those who are interested, and Omochao (a robotic chao) can colorfully guide you through the menus. This game is well thought, well planned, and well designed. There is even a zone for pinball fans in Casinopolis so this game has something for absolutely everyone. GET THIS GAME! Trust me, you will get hours of enjoyment from it.",5,Sonic Heroes come to the Rescue! (by Laura),1176163200,"04 10, 2007",0.2067
6,A2QS6Y2IWZNQZK,B00000IZS1,J. Wood,"[3, 4]","This title marks Sonic's first launch on more than one platform...three to be exact. Finally a Sonic title is available on, not only Game Cube, but PlayStation 2 and XBox as well. The Story: Dr. Eggman has devised a new plan to take over the world, a newly reincarnated, and upgrated, Metal Sonic. That's right, Sonic's old rival from Sonic CD is back and ready for all new mayhem. It will take more than one hero to foil Eggman this time, It'll take twelve. But when Metal Sonic gets enough power to change into the all mighty Metal Overlord, will Sonic and his friends be enough to stop him? Heroes features a uniqe team based gameplay which includes four teams of three including: Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails and Knuckles), Team Rose (Amy, Big and new comers Cream and Cheese), Team Chaotix (Vector, Espio and Charmy), and Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge and new comer E-123 OMEGA). To add to the fun, each team has their own themed challenge i.e. Rose is easy, Sonic is medium, Dark is Hard and Chaotix is mission based. Also each member has their own affiliation: speed, flight and power. The game will tell you where you will need to use each character's uniqe skills.

This has some old (speed and loop-de-loops) and some new. Graphics are ok. I expect Sonic to be cartoony and I don't understand people who complain about it.I really enjoy the teams feature although I tend to abuse the power characters (ie. Knuckles, Mr. Big the Cat, Omega, and Vector). Each team has 3 members each attributed with either speed, power, or flight. Typically you will be required to use them all in each level. Also certain teams are easier to play than others with Team Rose the easiest.Here is a quick breakdown of the teams:Team Sonic: Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails. Sonic is the speed character, Knuckles is power, and Tails is flight.Team Dark: Shadow (speed), Rouge (flight), and Omega (power).Team Chaotix: Vector (power), Charmy (flight), and Espio (speed).Team Rose: Amy Rose (speed), Cream and Cheese (flight), and Mr. Big (power).",5,Great for kids,1302393600,"04 10, 2011",0.1241

13,A329U9CDUPKXAC,B00000IZS1,Patrick,"[0, 0]","For me, this game is just about as fun as Sonic Adventure 2. It will keep you going for a pretty long time if you wanna beat the game with all 4 storylines. And, who doesn't? The controls, for the most part, are pretty good. Although, there a times where you can accidentally be swinging a weapon and you'll swing yourself right off a cliff and die. That will happen more than once to you.My biggest problem with the game is the camera sometimes. Especially when flying, the camera will be in a position where you can't see the ground below you so you'll have to guess as where to land. And you WILL guess wrong at least once. And you will die.I'm not sure, but I think the PS2 version is missing some textures. Particularly when flying, the shadow below the characters is missing. The shadow is critical for knowing where you will land. Without it, it just makes things all the more difficult. I think the shadow is present in the Gamecube version.But I love the level designs and the missions. I don't find them overly difficult. They're a challenge but that's a good thing.If you're a Sonic fan, this is a must have.",4,"Overall, a really fun game",1240531200,"04 24, 2009",-0.0168

How it was all about FUN and SPEED, and not the exploration and questing that the latter Dreamcast sequels seemed to have in abundance?Well, Kids, Sonic is back and better than ever and now, thanks to some extremely brave and very, very well-executed gameplay changes, regains his foothold as the best platform hero in the world, bar none :-)Granted, it feels all wrong playing Sonic with a PS 2 pad, but I know I speak for us all when I say I'd rather have Sega Games this way than not at all.Sonic Heroes consists of all the usual levels - Seaside Hill Zone, Casino Nite Zone, etc., but it's in the teamwork where this game excels. Now, instead of just playing as one Hedgehog or one Echidna or one Bat or whatever, you have to employ teamwork across a cast of three characters per level in order to beat the game. There are 4 teams, so 12 playable characters in all - and range from Staples like Team Sonic (Sonic, Knuckles and Tails) to past characters (Rose the Bat, Big the Cat and Espiosa the... purple thing) to downright oddball characters (Charmy the Bee, for instance). On each team, one character is good for speed, one for strength and one for flying, and you do need to make good use of each character to beat the level you're currently playing. Also, the teams are graded in terms of difficulty, so beginners can start with Team Rose and work their way up, frustration-free.This adds a huge sense of fun to the game, as well as keeping the Sonic concept fresh and exciting: hedgehog-runs-along-flat-plane is dull-dull-dull, but for the speed freaks the bonus levels are all about speed, and highly reminiscent of the Bonus Stages from Sonic 2. Similarly excellent is the presentation, as one would expect from a Sega game - there are a wealth of options to be unlocked, like new modes of play, the fabulous CG movies, different voices for the characters etc. - all of which makes for an excellent gaming experience.Thoroughly recommended, this is another feather in Sega's cap and one of my personal favourite Sonic games to date.

It's apparently a sequel to Sonic Adventure 2: Battle (though, I hardly see how), which I loved, but it wasn't as fun as I expected. There are four teams with different stories and varying difficulties, but each team plays through the same levels in the same order. The areas have a decent variety, but when you play through each four times, it gets boring. There were sometimes changes to the levels, but not much.In terms of gameplay, each team has three characters, and you can switch between which one you control. One is a speed character, one is for flying, and one is better at attacking. This is kind of fun, and it is mainly what makes the game unique.I also think the game could be too hard. I don't mind a challenge, but the game could be too ridiculous at times. It wasn't even fun many times because of this. Once you practice a lot, it's not so bad, but it took a lot of practice to get good enough that the game finally became somewhat fun. I believe there was a final story after the four main ones, which would have been nice to reach, but I couldn't get all the Chaos Emeralds, so I couldn't. So try to get them as you go along, or you must redo levels. Not much happened in the part of the story I actually got so see, and it could have been interesting, but I don't know.So I really wouldn't suggest buying the game unless you really want to and really like Sonic games. It's not terrible. It can be fun, and the gameplay is unique, but repeating levels and the difficulty is what disappoints me about it.",3,Not What I Expected,1319846400,"10 29, 2011",0.0305

First up is Team Sonic, which is Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails. Sonic is good for speed, Knuckles for power, and Tails for flying. Let me just say right now I HATE Tails's voice. Cream's and Charmy's too. Just because they're little kids doesn't mean they need to sound dumb. And how can Sonic be 8?! There is no way. I still think he's at LEAST 17.Team Chaotix: By far my favorite team. I love Vector, he's so awesome. This team is more or less based on certain missions to do, not exactly getting through the stages. You have to find certain things, or defeat a certain number of enemies, or things like that. This team is for people who want something different. HATE Charmy's voice.Team Dark: This is a team for more intermediate players. The levels are a bit longer, and the puzzles are more confusing. But still, it's a fun team to be. The voice acting for them are okay, I just wish Shadow sounded like he did in Shadow the Hedgehog.Team Rose: HATE Cream's voice. These levels are easier and shorter, these are for beginning players and younger players as well. The levels are not hard to figure out, nor are they very long. If you want a challenge, I suggest trying Team Chaotix. I adore Big, but Amy is kind of stupid. The way she obsesses over Sonic is rather creepy, but whatever.All in all, the game is great.
