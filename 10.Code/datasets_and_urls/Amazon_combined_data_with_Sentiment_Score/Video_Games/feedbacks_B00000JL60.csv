I have played more puzzle games than I can count in my head and this game has by far the best puzzles of them all. The graphics, sound, and interaction of this game are stunning. The way that you have to collect information from every available source to solve a puzzle makes the game extraordinary (many puzzle games do not work that way).One aspect of the puzzles in this game that makes it different from many other games is that you cannot guess to solve a puzzle. With many games, you can get past a tough point just buy clicking on every item in your inventory until you guess the right one. Eventually, you guess right, and you're on to the next puzzle. In Myst, you must decipher them the old-fashioned way!I agree with other reviewers, however, that this game has zero replayability. It should take you long enough though so that you won't feel like you didn't get your money's worth.",5,An all-time classic,982540800,"02 19, 2001",0.1798

With it's awesome graphics and compelling story, it's easy to see why this is the top selling game of all-time. In it's time, this game and The 7th Guest changed the way gaming was to be. Most point and click games you see today are following these 2 trend setting games, but it's very hard for them to match up to what these games accomplished. It has some very tough puzzles and about the only lacking was there isn't much going on when you click on an area except for sound which is a key for most of the puzzles you will be solving. If you like point and click games with puzzles to solve, this is the game for you. A thoroughly enjoyable game that I have played close to a dozen times.",5,Mystical.,981676800,"02 9, 2001",0.3764

I will half to admit, that I used the strategy guide a great deal to help me, because some parts were just impossible. First of all, you half to be extremely knowledgeable before you even attempt to play this game. There are things that i don't even understand, and im not dumb. But the most difficult thing is tying together little pieces of the game to figure out one piece of the puzzle. I really like this game, and have yet to beat it. The music is haunting almost, and makes you feel like you are there, walking in a realistic 3D enviorment surrounded by things that you have no idea what they are, but will tie into the game as it progresses. There are also 5 completly diffrent &quot;Ages&quot; : Myst island, The Selentic Age, The Stoneship age, The Mechanical Age, and The Channelwood Age.

5,AQZH7YTWQPOBE,B00000JL60,Enjolras,"[0, 0]","There are very few video games from over 20 years ago that still go strong in the second decade of the 21st century. Myst is one of them. I remember playing this game back in 1993 and getting my but whipped with the puzzles. I recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is. Of course, graphics have advanced since 1993, but Myst shows game developers how puzzles should really work.Unlike too many games today, Myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery. When you start the game, you're just thrown into a new world with no explanation. You are left to explore and discover. There is a story with shocking twists, but the story depends upon your involvement and choices, not simply handed to you.The puzzles require a lot of time and thought. If you don't like puzzles and thinking, don't play this game. If you like challenges, Myst will challenge you. The puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way. Some are frustrating and I did need to look at a hint guide a few times (particularly for the Mechanical Age elevator) but they all do have a logic.Unlike other reviewers, I found the one area Myst doesn't hold up well is in building an immersive environment. Myst as a world doesn't have a logic. There's a spaceship, a boat, a clock tower, etc., just sitting on the island. It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world. I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world.Overall, Myst was a historic computer game back in 1993 and is still worth playing 20 years later. From the early 1990s, I personally preferred Presto Studios' Journeyman Project, which also had a compelling point-and-click adventure and featured pre-rendered 3D environments. However, until that game gets rereleased, Myst is easily the best point-and-click adventure readily out there.Note: the game is also available on iPhone, iPad, Nintendo 3DS, so there's no excuse not to try it out.",4,A historic game that still has life in it,1338681600,"06 3, 2012",0.1516

And that is probably the easiest puzzle you'll get concerning Myst, too. Since it is a popular game that was released a quite a long time ago, you've probably heard of it by now. I'll just say this one thing: If you're deaf or impatient, AVOID. There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones...heck, even if you're NOT deaf, it's still quite a puzzler!

However, the story isn't as interesting as the ambiance would have you think and the movement is absolutely, irritatingly choppy.I don't believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help.

9,A3OMBKL5EOHA36,B00000JL60,Jami Blackann,"[3, 3]","Released back in 1995, Myst is a classic game that revolutionized the gaming industry. Rand and Robyn Miller created a new type of game which diverted from the typical mass market and took off into a fascinating and innovative direction. It's hailed as a landmark in the industry and praised for both its aesthetics and story.I think that Myst is best described as an experience rather than merely a video game. Its creators strived to develop a world rich with detail and intrigue, with a subtle narrative intertwined into the strange yet beautiful surroundings. As the game begins, you are dropped onto the island of Myst without very much information to guide you. What immediately strikes you as unique about this experience is that there are no friendly characters to help you on your way, no enemies to fight, and not a very clear purpose. The game is largely about just exploring your surroundings and experimenting with different devices around the various worlds. This is what makes the game so immersive. The graphics of Myst, though not quite as extravagant as today's, were definitely of high quality. Cyan built its 3D world through an extensive layout of still images and QuickTime movies, and the end result is simply amazing. Navigation is node-based, meaning that you don't necessarily walk through the environment but rather point and click your way through your surroundings. Each new section loads as if you really had relocated, giving the appearance of movement. Making a 3D world in this manner might seem strange, but at the time it was a necessary shortcut to make it possible to run the game on computers without a lot of RAM and processor power. Even by today's standards, I still think the environments look impressive.So what exactly does the gameplay entail? As you explore the island, you discover two journals with missing pages, each of which belong to Atrus's sons, Sirrus and Achenar. Your main objective is to travel through the different worlds, or Ages, and retrieve the missing pages from each book. As you recover each page, you learn more about each brother, and you must try to discover who is lying and who is telling the truth. In the end, it will be up to you to decide their respective fates. Your journey is not easy, for you will have to solve rather challenging puzzles in order to progress throughout the worlds. This can often be frustrating, for the puzzles' solutions are not always intuitive. It will take much patience and observation, and perhaps even a little help.The sounds in this game are mysterious and enchanting. The soundtrack consists of strange, sometimes haunting tunes that blend in remarkably well with each respective area. Moreover, the sounds are integral to the gameplay, for some of the puzzles involve listening in addition to seeing. You will need to observe and interpret different sounds and apply that information to the challenges you face. This is yet another way in which you can truly become immersed within the game. The music makes your surroundings feel foreign and believable.Myst was groundbreaking for its time, and it started an incredible journey that would spark several sequels. It's an experience that is visually, musically, and intellectually stimulating, and though the game is a bit dated now, I still think it's worth playing if you enjoy a good challenge. As many have mentioned, the ending is somewhat anticlimactic, but at the same time it will most likely make you want to continue the adventure with Riven.",5,An immersive classic.,1150675200,"06 19, 2006",0.1905
10,AT1GMH2UHYROT,B00000JL60,Lee DeWald,"[6, 7]","&quot;Myst&quot; is the one that started it all. &quot;Myst&quot; is the game by which all other role-playing games are measured. No one had any idea when the game first came out in 1993 that it would eventually become the best-selling computer game of all time.Rand and Robyn Miller, the brothers who created the wildly successful game, hit upon a winning idea. Place someone into an unknown world where the clues he or she uncovers reveals the story. And one of the biggest perks of all - you can't die.&quot;Myst&quot; starts off by dumping you on a dock overlooking a vast ocean. You can hear water lapping along the dock, and a wind makes the hair on your neck stand up. And from there it only gets more interesting - you discover books that can link you to other worlds like this one, more commonly called Ages; you encounter all sorts of devices that, even though they don't appear to do much, are all part of the underlying thread tying the game together; and just by wandering around you immerse yourself in the world that is &quot;Myst.&quot;Occasionally, I meet people who are baffled at the success of &quot;Myst.&quot; They don't understand how a game where you just walk around and solve stuff can be so appealing. There is little or no character interaction, they say. I've noticed that a lot of these same people are those who like those &quot;shoot'em up and splatter their guts all over the wall&quot; type of gamers. The reason &quot;Myst&quot; has been so successful is because it so pure - you don't have to worry about dying, you use your head to get your way through things, and each new Age you encounter is just bursting with intriguing things to discover. That and each world is beautiful. Not as jaw-dropping as &quot;Riven&quot; and not nearly as mesmerizing as &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;, but &quot;Myst&quot; has a subtle yet majestic beauty that makes it stand apart from other games.If you have never played a computer game before, give &quot;Myst&quot; a try. You will be surprised at how addictive it can become. Did I mention that there is no possible way in which you can be killed? Seriously! How many games today offer that? There's a reason why it has been such a hit; millions and millions of people can't be wrong.",4,Continues to Leave Me Mystified,1010188800,"01 5, 2002",0.178

I know it was the one that got me hooked--to the point where I kept upgrading computers and peripherals just to keep up with the games. I tried to replay Myst a year ago and found I couldn't figure it out (have I lost that many brain cells over the years?), didn't have the patience or something to keep at it. But like a first love, I remember it very fondly and treasure it. It's almost heart breaking to think that some day soon, as Windows continues to do upgrade to different styles of OS, newbies won't be able to experience Myst. Just like so many young people will never know how it felt when rock'n'roll burst forth. To confess, I liked the graphics in Riven better. And I never liked Artus (whatever) or his two sons--thought they were all slackers and whiners with serious emotional problems. I loved that you could not die and nothing attacked you--really allowed [me] to explore and indulge my curiosity. Loved the details (little bugs that moved, atmosphere, just everything). Sound effects and music--wasn't Myst one of the first to put visuals and music together? All in all, many good things started with Myst. I know it was the first computer game that spent time and money on the graphics (something I always appreciated). At most places, the game play wasn't strictly linear so you could play in whatever order you wanted. You could spin around and see everything. It was totally mouse driven. One feature I loved (but many others complained about) was that it was an empty world, you never had to/got to interact with anyone else in Myst; for me it was somewhere of my own where I could explore to my heart's content, go back and walk around areas that I liked (like tree world (can't remember it's actual name) even after you finished that level.

While the environments were increadibly beautiful, they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay, which has you go to one place at least 5 times to solve five different puzzles. The story is intruiging, yet the game's ending fails to please the player, since, you'll discover shortly after completing it, it could be completed in a matter of minutes.A good game for 10 to 20 dollars, but you shouldn't spend more than that on this weekend game.",2,Why is this a classic?,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",-0.2873

The game is fantasy-based, puzzle game, incorporating unique locations and mechanical motifs. While a bit outdated in some ways, the game is intriguing and fun and well worth buying.-PlotYou play a character who finds themselves stranded on a tiny island. While exploring, you begin to discover the dark past of the island which you are visiting. Using ingenious linking books you can access other islands and unravel the truth behind the lonely, mysterious worlds.-EnvironmentThe environments, while not necessarily beautiful, are well done. There are a total of five islands, all with different motifs. These islands, or ages include: -A world with half-sunken boats and flooded tunnels.-An age with a spinning building.-A Cyprus forest with a network of treehouses.-An odd, out-of-this world island with a gigantic tunnel.The environments can be rather dark at times. In general there is little character interaction, leaving the player dealing mostly with puzzles and exploring.Music drifts in and out of the game, with some locations dominated by the sound of wind while others have music in the background. The music alternates between very dark to dark tinged. While the game does not have catchy tunes, it suits the game quite well as background music.-CharactersThere are few characters, and interaction is limited. There is a selection of journals in a library which provide interesting reading and histories of the various islands.-PuzzlesThis game is a puzzle game. The puzzles are generally mechanical in nature. The puzzle solutions can be illusive, but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious. Once you have solved puzzles once, they can generally be solved again quickly, allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet again.If you enjoy puzzles that involve common sense more than mathematics and like interesting and unique worlds, you will enjoy Myst.

19,AP3B615GM191G,B00000JL60,Zachary Koenig K-Dawg,"[2, 2]","There are very experiences in this world that are completely original. In terms of adventure PC gaming, however, Myst is utterly without equal and (if you are the right kind of person) will quickly become one of the most endearing experiences of all your entertainment pastimes.Before Myst, computer gaming usually was in the form of either first-person shooters (Wolfenstein), adventures aimed more towards children (Kings Quest), and the tons and tons of shareware/pong/simulator games that flooded the market in the early-to-mid 1990s. In Myst, though, gamers are simple dropped into an environment where little to no information is given to them, thus requiring much exploring and a logical mind to determine not only the overall point of the game, but also how all the levers and puzzles work in conjunction with each other.For a basic plot summary, you (the Stranger) suddenly appear in a universe where a man named Atrus can pen books that actually spring to life. However, many of his worlds are dying/unstable and you must determine the cause. Is it Atrus himself who has gone mad and imprisoned his sons in his own prison books, or are the sons locked away for good reason? The Stranger must explore a series of five islands and piece together the mystery one puzzle and logical deduction at a time.This Myst series is not for everyone, by any means. If you are a bit lacking in patience and want a lot of action, this is not the game for you. It can get a bit tedious at times and one has to resist (especially nowadays when walk-throughs are available with a few mouse clicks) the urge to look up hints all the time (as that truly destroys the beauty of the experience), so if you want to be blasting baddies or wreaking war/havoc, look elsewhere are the risk of severe disappointment.For those who really appreciate this kind of thinking-person's game, Myst is unrivaled (and I have tried MANY of its subsequent clones) in the industry because of its riveting storyline. A lot of other games have tried to duplicate the puzzling style of Myst, but only Myst has been able to successfully capture the emotion of compelling characters that never seem to get old.Overall, I consider Myst to be one of my all-time favorite PC games because of its groundbreaking intuitive style. In hindsight, at least two of its sequels surpass this original, but Myst is always special because it set the groundwork for the master series. If you want your brain/wits to be more involved in a PC game than your trigger finger, then I strongly recommend Myst if you haven't tried it to this point.
