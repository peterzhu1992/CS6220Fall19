1,A15PUBCS4N4G60,B00000IJVY,buckeyede06,"[0, 0]",There were so many cool Hidden things in this game and strange little things that you could do beyond just racing. The glitch were when you were driving towards the center of the destruction Derby and hit it just right and go shooting into the air is my favorite. This always used to make my day as a kid,5,Awesome game lots of modes,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",0.0064
