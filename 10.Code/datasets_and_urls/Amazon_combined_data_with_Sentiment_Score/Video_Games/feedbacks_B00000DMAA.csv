I have played 8 and 9 also, but 7 has the best music, battle system, and junctioning system of all of them (not to mention the greatest story-line in the history of everything!). Besides a couple of translation errors, this game is perfect. I was introduced to Final Fantasy 7, 3 years ago, and I still do not know many things about it. So if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you, but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it, you should buy this game, and before they stop selling it.",5,Greatest RPG... no... game in the world!,988329600,"04 27, 2001",0.3255

Let me tell you about the game:As you have probably found out from other reviews, it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc., who is polluting the Earth. One of these members is a man named Cloud, a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier, which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles, they proved to be a challenge. Cloud, Sid, and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time. Espeically the 11 minute ending. Man that was good. ENJOY!",5,Quite Possibly the best game i've ever played.,996537600,"07 31, 2001",0.4125
2,ABSX5TGEGRH76,B00000DMAA,Andrew Radaar,"[0, 0]","In this world, nothing is as it seems. No one is who they say they are, and surprises lurk around every corner. This is a wonderful game, with a rich story, great side quests, and great animation. The evil Shin-Ra corporation has been mining Mako, an energy source that is the lifeforce of the Earth itself. Avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by Barret, a man who's arm was lost in an explosion at a Mako refinery. Cloud is a mercenary who used to work for SOLDIER, Shin-Ra's private army. Sephiroth is a great warrior for SOLDIER, who has been lost for many years. Now, Cloud is working with Avalanche, and Sephiroth has resurfaced, but he is now an insane, powerhungry man with a desire to use Black Materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world. Materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user. This game has a great story and a great battle engine, where you can customize 9 different characters with different materia. This is a long game, but it is legendary.",5,Ultimate,1020470400,"05 4, 2002",0.0122
3,AKOQ2U5KUVSN2,B00000DMAA,Brian Duffy,"[1, 1]","Final Fantasy 7 is yet another gold brick in the shimmering castle of Squaresofts frequent triumphs. You will fall in love with the characters, you'll wish you could jump right into the world. The game's events are structured very well(except for the ever-present level up before the final boss stage of the game). The graphics are wonderful in their own right. It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be.But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer. And keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically, I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller). And otherwise, this is a striaght port so you're not missing anything if you go for the PS version. But, if you refuse to/can't buy a playstation, this version is better than nothing and you certainly won't want to miss out.",4,"A masterpiece, but go for the PS version",960076800,"06 4, 2000",0.2594

I play it everyday, but I was always sad, because I had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss FF 7. But not anymore! Now, FF 7 is out on the PC, and you have to buy it at any cost, so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time, the experience that is Final Fantasy 7, on your computer! Just thinking about it is making me tear up a little. I promise, you will not be disappointed. The stunning, gut-wrenching visuals, the passionate, heart-wrenching storyline, the exciting, ball-wrenching combat system, the absolutely awe-inspiring characters...nothing could be more perfect. You have not lived if you have not played this game.",5,"Finally, you can play the greatest game ever on your PC!!!!",1080518400,"03 29, 2004",0.389

There's even a tutorial, so you can get in the game quicker! As for the storyline, excellent! The storyline goes all over the place, but that's what fun about it! The game itself is also long and entertaining. It took me 73 hours to finish, side-quests and all. You even get an amusement park filled with games and wonderful items to help you on your quest. Get this game!!! It will get you hoooked on hours to come!!!",5,The best Final Fantasy Game Ever!,987897600,"04 22, 2001",0.2597
6,A233JF1T2IIBLT,B00000DMAA,Genesis Whitmore,"[24, 26]","I've never played the Playstation version of this game and this was my first time playing any sort of Final Fantasy game. I originally purchased it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world, the characters, and the dozens of things to do.You start off playing Cloud (or whatever you decide to name him) and are an ex-soldier now fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company called Shinra because they're using Mako energy to power the city. Mako energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its used up the planet will die. From there you're quickly plunged into a story about love, betrayal, duty, and saving the world.I easily got 40+ hours of gameplay and the story blew me away. Every time yu think you know what's going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away. There's an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to folks in towns.This game also has great replayibility with dozens of sub-quests and side games to keep you busy. Can you raise a gold chocobo? Can you defeat all three weapons? Can you find all the mega-elixers? Can you gain the secret characters? Can you find everyone's super technique and ultimate weapons?The story was amazingly detailed, the characters were all unique, and the game pulled no punches. I highly reccomend it.",5,Great for adventure gamers and RPG fans!,965001600,"07 31, 2000",0.1365

8,A293BVHBY4TIKH,B00000DMAA,Matthew Smith,"[3, 3]","This game is fantastic, and you wont be able to put it down for a long long time. I have over 120+ hours played on my game save. Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrack...that I find 2x better than the PSone version's soundtrack. Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls, after playing for a while, you'll wonder how you would have done it any other way. The on-screen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship, you'll have a hard time typing in key combos. Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters, allowing for different characters to use Summons, Magic, and Cure. My tip: dont give up solely because of the controls---this game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into, the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it. FF7 is by far the best game I have ever played, and you do not want to miss out on this adventure. My only tip: dont save over the same file, especially before you enter the Northern Crater--you wont be able to exit it if you do.Replayability: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt (Tons of extra caves, quests, missions, mini-games to find, extra materia, weapons, limit-breaks, and bosses to fight well after the game is over.)Gameplay: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt (Amazing boss fights, you will be on the edge of your seat during battles, incredibly fun)Story: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt (The plot twists, the depth in the story, the emotions...its AMAZING)Graphics: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt (You can view on a big resolution, better textures and stuff. More crisp than the PSone version)Controls: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt (Takes a while to get used to, you wont want to try another control setup once you do)Sound: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt (Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game, BUT, the music was totally redone, and that is one of the biggest parts of this game)Addictiveness: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt (I stopped playing my other games for almost 4 months when I got into this game)The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play. The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game. Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldnt be more fun, and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I havent uninstalled from my computer. Final Fantasy VII is a keeper, and dont be discouraged by the prices on Amazon, by the time you're done with the game, you will believe it to be the best $50 you have spent on a game.

Never has any other FF game seen such an influenced with multiple related games/story characters found in different games. Multiple Movies. Toys, cards, etc based on this game. Why was that all necessary for this one game?It's just that DAMN AWESOME! This game has everything! Story, characters, battle system, music, humor and more! If it didn't why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after? Because it was just damn awesome!You can play this game over and over before getting tried of it, but you will keep it in your hearts forever.

12,A1FKAMZL7SOF9P,B00000DMAA,Stormtrooper,"[0, 0]","I'll preface this by saying yes I have played through FFVII on the playstation when it first came out. I've probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story, how it unfolds, the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together.Prior to this game, I was mostly into sports/FPS type games. An RPG (heck I didn't even know what that meant at the time) game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted. A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game. Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it, the more I got interested in it.Then came release day. I still wasn't sold on it but after leaving work I figured... what the hell. Drove 45 minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames. Soon as I entered he was like Did you preorder this!!. I told him no and that I wasn't really interested in RPG's as they always sound boring and I'd lose interest quick and waste my money. He showed me a quick demo and I admit, it got me thinking as to I wonder what happens after this.... I finally said sure. He hooked me up with the strategy guide, free tshirt and the 3 disc game... 3 DISCS!! When I cracked open the case and saw 3 discs... I knew this would be an epic, legendary tale. I just didn't know how epic.I won't go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know who/what they are. But the story... wow. I could not have been more hooked. At first it started off a little slow, mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going. After the 2nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris... it all changes. The direction, tone and emotion starts running higher. Battles get more intense. You really get the feel that something big, much bigger than even all these characters is building up. It all seems to point to Shinra, but even as you infiltrate it, something is even more disturbing. JENOVA. Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber.. my jaw dropped. I wanted to know what it is, where it came from, what they are using it for etc etc etc. But thats what set this game apart. The more answers you get, the more questions were raised than before.The world is huge, lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines. I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia.Materia System: One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date. While you won't use all the materia you buy/find. Its the reward of seeing that glowing green/blue/red/yellow/purple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is. Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made. Knights of the Round was very long to summon, but the damage and wait is well worth it.Characters: Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds. I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA, Sephiroth and the experiments. The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations. Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner.In conclusion, for us long-timers here this game never gets old. For the newcomers, get ready to experience something extraordinary. To quote the back of the Playstation case.. What erupts goes beyond imagintion.",5,"Storyline, Characters, Emotion... this game has it!",1346284800,"08 30, 2012",0.1072
13,A4CNLZGR3NM23,B00000DMAA,Thomas F. Hooker bulmabriefs144,"[3, 4]","An interesting aspect of the Final Fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment. The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development.FF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle(Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on)FFII- wound-developable characters(Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.)FF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills)FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin)FFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it)FFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills)FF7- basic weapon systemFF8- GF systemFF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the gameLikewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV. They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting. Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).",5,Awesome!,1131148800,"11 5, 2005",0.1028
