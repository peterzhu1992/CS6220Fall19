For those of you that have never played any other Zelda game, what are you waiting for? Now is a great time to start.Ocarina of Time is amazing. All the elements of classic Zelda are there - dozens of powerful items and weapons, lots of secrets to find, at least 10 new 3D-rendered challenging dungeons, plenty of secrets and side-games, and something that all the other Zelda's never had: a truly great story!If you enjoyed &quot;A Link to the Past&quot; you will most certainly like this game as well. The story of Ocarina of Time involves going back and forth in time, between a happy peaceful Hyrule, and a dark evil one, much like ALTTP; but don't think this is a rip-off on its predecessor. The complex dungeons, challenging bosses, and deepening story lines will blow you away. The 3D element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before. Even the music is catchy and well orchestrated. (I actually downloaded the mp3 soundtrack online!)The gameplay is a little tough to get used to - afterall, you've never played Zelda in 3D before - so you actually have to consider things sneaking up behind you, and flying overhead! But once you get used to the controls and learn to use the &quot;Z-Targeting&quot; feature (using the trigger button will solve just about any control problem you may encounter), the gameplay gets easier.The only thing that annoyed me was Navi, a little fairy that travels with Link throughout the game. She is always bugging you to give you painfully obvious information. I suppose she is a helpful guide for younger or more inexperienced players, but I found her annoying. But once you come to realize that Navi is an important aspect of the game's control, you will let it slide.I would recommend this game to anyone who owns an N64 console, and even more so if you enjoyed SNES's &quot;A Link to the Past.&quot; I can't wait to play the sequel when it comes out.",5,One of the few N64 games you must own!,972432000,"10 25, 2000",0.1419

10,A2N1C9JKI2C5XD,B00000DMB3,An amazon visitor,"[1, 3]","I'm not really a fan of N64. I've always been more of a Playstation one fanatic, but Zelda is undoubtedly the best game that I have ever played. If you think that Final Fantasy is good, then Zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk. There's only a couple of games on the nintendo N64 console that of which I liked, and that was Gauntlet Legends, Super Mario, and Donkey Kong. But this game beats them all by a longshot.Then why did I give this game four stars instead of five? The reason is because of the...problems listed below.1. This game is HARD. I don't mean hard as in Challenging I'm talkin' about the whole you-possibly-will-never-ever-complete-the-game-without-a-strategy-guide hard. The type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time.2. There are a couple of glitches in the game. Example: I dare you to cut a sign with your sword. Then play Zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time. The piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float. That's just one of the glitches.3. A little confusing, as far as the story goes. It's better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it.4. Replay value isn't very high. Once you complete it, that's it. It's so hard that I wouldn't ever want to go through the same frustration again, as to the fact that it was very difficult, even if you do know what you're doing.Okay, those were the bads. Here are the goods.1. The graphics are outstanding. Wow. The whole world of Termina reminds me of middle earth, only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic.2. Once you beat the game, you feel satisfied with yourself. Sure, this game is a little short, but it will still take you a long time to beat it, no matter how experienced you are with gaming.3. The plot is good and twists a lot. I know that I said it was kind of confusing, and it kind of is, but it's still fun and the things that of which I did understood surprised me a lot.It's sort of a mystery.4. Fluint and absolutely excellent cut and FMW sequences. It's true. Like I said above, the graphics are wonderful. And plus, exploring a small portion of Termina, which you do through out the game, is an experience that you don't wanna miss.5. The bad guys are challenging, but not so challenging that you'll be ripping your hair out. Once you beat them, you feel satisfied.6. Highly addictive gameplay and plus you won't stop until you beat the game.But there's one major, and I mean MAJOR problem with this game. This game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life. Remember your family? You won't when you get this game, since you'l be wanting to play this game even more.

18,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000DMB3,B. E Jackson,"[0, 8]","Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your adventure through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!",2,a 2-star rating- I seriously can't give it a higher star,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",-0.0237

For one, the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake. The game plays across a vast world with different subsections, each with their own particular themes. The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game.

My interest was piqued. Then I realized it was a Zelda game. As a huge fan of A Link to the Past, I thought ZOMG that looks awesome! I need to get this more than I've ever needed to get anything! I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested, but that commercial sealed the deal. I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time, and that Christmas, my mom got it for me. Cheers!A lot has been said about OoT over the years. It has been referred to as the Best Game of All Time by some, and the Most Overrated Game of All Time by others. I'm not really in either camp, but I lean closer to the former group, I suppose. If you haven't played it yet, you should. It's out on a variety of platforms and there's even remake of it with better graphics, but I would still recommend the N64 version if you want the same experience people had back in the 90s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play.Story:You are Link. The Great Deku Tree, guardian of the forest in which you live, has summoned you. It's revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a Princess of Destiny, and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule -- nay, the world -- itself.Gameplay:To complete your quest and save Hyrule, you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors, human-sized spiders, horrible ghosts, and... immobile venus fly traps! Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest, and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss. There's much more to it that, but I'm trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who haven't played it.Hyrule is a vast world. One of your in-game guides tells you that You can go wherever you want. That's true, to a point. There's a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time. The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place, but whether or not you go there is often up to you. In an interactive world such as Hyrule, you can do many things. Why go see what's on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule? Or why go play the Shadow Temple -- which does not have any attractive Gerudo women -- when you could go to the Spirit Temple, which does? The exploration is one of OoT's best features, and it's probably better than any Zelda which came after it.Controls:They work well enough. You don't have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you, but personally, I never found it all that essential to the process.Ocarina of Time introduced a Z-targeting system for aiming at enemies and talking to non-playable characters. What you do is get near an enemy/NPC, press or hold Z, and then press a button to talk to them/attack them. The system pretty intuitive and well made, so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it.Music:*90s gripe* Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme? Oh, we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme? ARE YOU SERIOUS? But seriously, the music is pretty good. The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme. The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit, for the most part.Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons. OoT is guilty of this too, but only to a small degree. Apart from the Water Temple's melody, there's nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it. :POh, and I'm sad to report that the OoT Commercial Music is not in this game... :(Replay Value:It's pretty massive. You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through, or you can use different items to progress through the Temples. I summed it up in a sentence, but there's hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoT's possible variations.Like in the original Legend of Zelda, you can do the Three Heart Challenge, which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon. Essentially, that's playing Hard Mode (although it isn't really that hard).But if the Three Heart Challenge wasn't enough, OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder! There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat. Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas. On top of all that, you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage.______If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time, what are you?

But then I realized &quot;oh yeah there's more to this, isn't there?&quot; And that's when the fun started.Graphics: Although you can probably debate this, this has one of the best graphics you'll find on the system. Lot of areas just drop that &quot;wow factor&quot;, like when you first enter Zora's Domain or the game's many cutscenes.Sound: Although there's no voice, except for Navi's annoying &quot;Hey!&quot; and an occasional &quot;Hello&quot; from her or Link's grunts, it's got some awesome music. One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play, such as Song of Storms, Zelda's Lullaby and Song of Time, plus general area music. Although the overworld music isn't like what it was on Link to the Past, it's still great.Story: The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman. Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there. Even though it can be a quite simple story, it's just a huge epic story that kept me interested.Gameplay: The infamous Z-Targeting system that's spawned several developers to use it in their own games. The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this. Your C-Buttons are for your weapons. B is your sword and A is your action button(Talk, Jump, Climb,etc.). You'll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour.

But you're different. You really don't belong in this forest, instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule. You're a Hylian (normal people who actually grow up). You're out there to defeat Ganondorf. Ganondorf, most likely the person who killed your mother, is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King. The only person that can stop him is you (Link). Now the question is, will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule?If you think (or know) you can take that responsibility, then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N64 (if you don't have one) and experience something very special.

44,A1QXN22NDLTQTS,B00000DMB3,David,"[3, 3]","Zelda: OOT is centered around a massive, circular field called Hyrule. Around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons, castles, villages, volcanoes, etc... Each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle, and once explored, you travel back across Hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location. This makes areas more accessible, and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible, due to the fact that you're not endessly travelling through pre-explored ares. Backtracking is an important feature of OOT, due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly ... bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths. Hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges. The Ocarina of Time opens secret doors. Thus, pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game. This is compounded, when at one point in the game you aquire the Master Sword. This is a special sword which, upon claiming, makes you and the world age by seven years, and by doing the reverse, putting the sword back in it's mold, makes you and the world 7 years younger. The good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different. The future is controlled by evil, whereas the past is controled by good. Needless to say, your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil Ganondolf. However, in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future world.A main part of this game is the ocarina of time. Depending on what tune you play, the ocarina will turn night in to day, make it rain, open secret doors, or make blocks disappear, amoung other things. This adds an important layer to the game, for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress. For instance, after spending hours wondering what to do, the idea could suddenly hit you, Should I play Zelda's Lullaby in front of the waterfall? If successful, the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself, thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling. The actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history. In fact, only Computer World by Kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in OOT.By the time Zelda: OOT was released the difficulty in games was just perfect. Your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary, you were fustrated when you died, you were delighted when you succeeded. Fustration and anger are both necessary in games because it's those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed...

But of all the LoZ games, OoT is just plain incredible.In this game, you play as Link as he grows from a child into a young man while on his quest to defeat Ganon and save the world from ultimate, evil rule. Along the way, you meet many friends and face amazing boss battles.The graphics (at the time) were just incredible. It really made me enjoy looking at and playing the game. Nintendo really did a great job in this department.The gameplay is like no other. One of the few incredible games to utilize the C Buttons for vital controls, this game felt really comfortable to play, and there's tons to do in the game besides just beating it. Also, throughout the game, you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as Young or Adult Link to complete the game, which is awe-inspiring in my opinion. Sadly, after doing little everything, there's no addictive mini-games to really play and not much else to do, but go through the game again and again.The sound is incredible, and the music has never been better. I found myself turning the volume on the TV all the way up while playing this game, because the sound was that good!If you're an avid gamer, yet you've never played this game, then something's really wrong with you.

It's deep, engrossing, and the graphics are spetacular for a N64. Yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this, but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay, music, and theme. The story is old, but hey, it's a classic formula. Why change it? What would Zelda be without dungeons? This is one of the few 3rd person games I've played with great controls. The z-targeting system can change a traveling mode Link instantly to a combat alert, and maneuverable Link.

55,A2TCQOMHBRU5ED,B00000DMB3,Elizabeth Fay,"[2, 3]","The legend of Zelda has always been a series that continually delivers amazing games that are at the top of their class. The legend of Zelda has always been my favorite video game series of all time since I was little and their games continually suck away hours of my life. This is the game that made me truly love gaming(Before I just did it for fun). It also set the stage for other great games such as majoras mask, wind waker, and twilight princess.Gameplay: If you have played any of the other Zelda games, you will know that you play as Link, a young Kokiry boy who must go out on the adventure of a lifetime to defeat the evil Ganondorf and save Princess Zelda. The controls are flawless. You just move the analog stick to make Link move, move forward and press A to roll, press B to use your sword, the C buttons are home to you other weapons such as the bow, hookshot, and the like. This game introduced the revolutionary lock on system where you just pressed Z, and staid locked on to an enemy, which meant no more aimless sword swinging, it realy made the combat more managable, and much more fun, Like any Zelda game there is a huge overworld to explore. You have grassy plains, tall volcanic mountains, serene lakes, sandy deserts, difeerent towns and villages, and lots to do. The overworld is just enourmes, esspecially for an N64 game. Hyrule feild stretches in all directions. One of the great things about traveling is part way through the game, you will get a trusty horse named Epona. Riding around hyrule feild is just realy addicting. There are many great minigames to do as well, such as the shooting gallery, bombochu bowling, selling mask, and fishing, yes fishing. There are also special task to do such as collecting ten special poes(Huge ghost that appear in hyrule feild), or collecting 100 Skulltullas(Spiders of a horrible curse). The meat and Potatoes is of course the dungeons. Each dungeon is completley uniqe and different than the last one and shows off alot of great elements. There are many challenging puzzles that reward you when you figure them out. You raise and lower water, look for paths that are invisible with the lens of trooth, push giant blocks with the silver gauntlets, use the megaton hammer to push blocks, and much much more. Each dungeon is just very well crafted that it is hard to beleive that it came out in 1998. There are many feirce enemies in each dungeon that fight to put an end to your quest such as Stalfos, bats, lizolfos, armos, iron knuckles, jellyfish, tektikes, readeds, skulltullas, and so many more. The boss battles are each intricitley desighned and completely different than thre last in the way they look and fight. The boss battle with Ganon at the end is one of my all time favorite final battles ever(only rivald by the fight in twilight princess, and Mother brain). The difficulty is always just right with the challenges and enemys getting toupher as you go on. Through the game you get alot of fantastic weapons to use, such as a bow, hookshot, megaton hammer, hovor boots, silver gauntlets, boomerangs, and much more. Each is always put to good use and none of them ever go absolete and are awlays usefull the whole way through One of the big mechanics is of course the ocarina itself, you play it manually with the button layout being like the holes in the real thing. You can change day into night, transport across the world map, and open passage ways with you trusty instrument, and much more. The biggest suprise is after you get the Master sword and travel forard in time seven years. Time travel is a huge element in this game as some things you do as a child will effect the things you do as an adult, and vice versa. there are also different things avalible to do in each time and it is a blast to go between two time periods and it realy makes you feel powerfull. Nore matter which aspect of the gameplay I am talking about, I cannot find fault anywhere, absolutely perfect.Story: Hyrule was created by din Nyrule, and Farore, they left behinf the triforce which lies in the Sacerd realm. Many years later, an Evil Man named Ganondorf seeks the triforce and Places a curse on the deku tree, and does other horible things to many races . The deku tree tells navi, the fairy that she must awaken Link as he has been having a nightmare about the evil man. Link goes to get a sword and Sheild, and goes to see the great Deku tree who asks him to rid the curse. Link succeeds but finds out that he is far to late. Before dying, the Deku tree tells him the legond of the triforce and gives him the spirituall stone of the forest, the Kokirys emerald, and then tells him to go to hyrule castle to meet nPrincess Zelda. Link goes to hyrule castle, meets princess Zelda Who tells him of the dreams she has been having about Ganondorf and Ask Link to get the other two stones, Link obliges and gets them but finds that it is to late As princess Zelda and Impa flee hyrule catsle, Zelda throws him the Ocarina of time. Link then comes face to face with Ganondorf and gets a taste of his power. Zelda then Telapethacally teaches him the song of time. Link goes to the Temple of Time and Plays it at the alter where the stones are placed and opens the secret chamber where he finds the Master Sword. Link being the legendary hero, takes the master sword, but finds that he has fallen into Ganondorfs trap. He is then seald in time for seven years where he is awakened by the sage of light Rareu. Link discovers that he is now an Adult. and instructs him to find and awaken the other sages. This is where the game gets epic, but I wont spoil anymore fore, suffice it to say it is a great story that is very well told and will keep you wanting to find out what happens next.Graphics: These graphics were truly groundbraking and ahead of their time back in 1998. The moment you step out into hyrule feild and se the scale and distance you will be mesmerized. The game shows off some fantastic day and night sequences as well as many different colors. Hyrule market looks and feels alive, the kakariko village will look like a town with houses and shops. The desert esspecially is arguablly the best way to show off the N64s power with snadstorms and wind effects. The Charecter models are great for Lnik, to Zelda, To Ganondorf, to the bosses, to even the NPCs. The enemys realy look feirce and different. These graphics truly set the standerd in 1998.Sound: The sound effects themselves are Spectacular like the flowing water, the clank of a sword hitting a wall or an enemy, the enemy sounds when thay are struck bu the sword or when they are attacking, Lniks yelps, and much more. The game features a brilliant musicalll score, Koji kondos work is reminiscent of John williams almost, and that is not a comparison I make lightly. You will hum the beat of the lost woods, love the powerfull melody of the temple of time, be entranced by the song of storms, there is just so many great melodys that I have lost count. The song of time is truly memorable as well as all of the others. My only complaint might be the lack of the traditional overworld thing and Navis annoying hey listen screams, but these are all tossed aside once you hear Koji Kondos work at its finest with the lost woods theme and song of time.Replay Value: I still play this game nonstop. It truly proves that Amazing agameplay oulives any other aspect of a game. There is just so much to do and so much to see and so many places to explore that you will never want to drop the conntroller.This game is My favorite game of all time and is a must buy for any N64 owner, or enouph of a reason to get one if you do not have one already. It is also avalible on the Wii vertuall console and is well worth the download. This is the game of my Childhood and I cannont stress enoph how much you need to get this game.",5,My favorite game of all time,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",0.1643

57,A1NJ3SRMUS03PI,B00000DMB3,Ella C. Weidman beawei,"[0, 1]","A Good game comes along, entertaining millions of fans worldwide. Then, a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place. Ever since the beginning of game history, every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year. Since Sept. 98, that cycle has been broken, stopped by one game that never got replaced, even by it's sequals, nothing ever ended out better than Zelda: Ovarina of Time. This game has revolutionized 3D gaming with its Z-Target system. It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline. It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the side-quests and collectible items in it. This game, I am predicting, will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out (The one after gamecube). Its Z-Targeting system makes Link (the main character) look at an enemy, within this looking, he can circle around it in stategic patterns, accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away, and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks. Many games, even nowadays, imitate this system, but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda did/does. The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many never-growing children in it. All these children have one compainon fairy with them, except one boy, who does not. Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time, you know your in for an adventurous, complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month. And, this game has many, many side quests to do. There are 100 special spiders to defeat and get treasures with, 50 magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas, 25 heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with, 15 masks to sell and play around with, 6 empty bottles to collect, a chicken to rais, and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game. And much more. This game also has the perfect sound to it. The cheerfull, happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in it's background music. The adventurous, wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in it's background song. The fast-paced and action-packed lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in it's song. Everywhere you turn in this game, you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place, and transations perfectly with whatever the player/link might be doing in that place. This game's sequal, Majoras Mask, suffered horribly from the lack of this. And the prevous games in the series didnt meet this either. One more thing though, I'll admit it to the world, I hate the main Zelda theme. I'm glad its not in Ocarina of Time, In a game that so clearly stands out with it's music, one old sounding, bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouv'dv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time. Oh, I forot to mention that part too, the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it. The places are designed very well, and when mixed in with the fabulous background music, gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game, whatsoever. The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest, which actually used to seem so big, onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild, the sun will blind the screen for a moment, and as rising, reveal this spectacular, wide open feild with a tuft of trees, a monstor here and there, a ranch in the middle, and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun. Along the feild, a rise in elevation starts, as you climb the hill, you can see even more than you could before, a magestic, huge catsle, a winding clear blue river, a deep valley, a menancing volcanoe, and a huge lake, along with a tuft of trees, and a monstor here and there. As you travel to new places, you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too, when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small, humble houses of the village below it, with the perfect backgrond music for example. With this great feeling of adventure, huge enviroments, much huger than even the ones of nowaday games, and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time, until a greater game will come out, wich will probably take a very very long time. If you dont already own this game (Shame on you), you should buy it immediatly, and while waiting for it to ship, download an emulated version. Now.

It has a fairly good story, it's interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next, and it has a gameplay that's unbeatable. The combat system is very simple and great. You have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake. There is so much to do in this game that it's comaprable to a good RPG, something that N64 hasn't been blessed with yet. The graphics are pretty good, especially since they don't use the expanssion pack, and the world is just huge. One down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough, and sometimes, you may feel lost and don't know what to do next. The bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game. This game will defently take a couple months to beat, unless you play 24/7. After you master the game, then it'll just take a couple of days, like any other normal, or great game. Nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one. One thing I didn't like about it is that it has gotten eaiser than it's predicessors. I've started playing Zelda games since the SNES days. Back then, it was Zelda: A Link to the Past. The game was tough. I'll admit it, it took me a year to beat that. That game was also HUGE. But now, 3D has made things eaiser, which I like and don't like. But another thing I don't like. They keep on changing the whole story of Zelda. Those of you who played the SNES game will know what I'm talking about. There, Link didn't live in a forest, and there wasn't a guardian fairy. And the whole world changed too. Well, maybe it's for the best, but I wouldn't mind if they made a remake of it, maybe for the GBA?.....",5,Excellent,992995200,"06 20, 2001",0.218

I played it just to try it and I wound up getting so addicted I had to buy it for my N64. I would stay up til all hours playing it. It's rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you can't help but say okay I'ma try one more time then I'm turning it off and still be playing a couple of hours later.The Water Temple was the biggest pain for me because I tend to rush into things and wouldn't do things right as far as the puzzles went. I loved the Forest Temple as a kid. The weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do. The boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach, hitting switches, and killing enemies. The ones I loved were bombs except when I got too close to them. lolI don't remember much else about the game since it's been a while since I had time to play it. I do know it took me quite a while before I managed to get some things such as all the Poes and Golden Skulltulas but no matter how many times I play this game it doesn't lose its appeal. Like I said, it's challenging but not so hard that you throw the controller down in frustration and give up.It's the second easiest game of the three Zelda's I've played. Twilight Princess, although very in depth, was easy and Majora's Mask was the hardest but only because I kept running out of time when doing certain tasks. Ganon was hard for me to kill at first but I think now that I've played it enough and therefore fought him enough I know what to expect and I can now anticipate what he's going to do and react accordingly.All in all, I recommend this game even if the system it was made for is pretty much a thing of the past.",5,Zelda....,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",0.3888

This never happened with me with a video game before. The scenery is breathtaking and some of the music scores are beautiful, although I think the music in the first forest dungeon as an adult is absolutely creepy! The dungeons are puzzling at times but not too hard, and the bosses are challenging enough you may have to try them several times, but don't worry you can eventually beat them. The game has a built in save feature so you don't need a memory card and you can save anywhere in the game, don't have to wait for any specific save point, that is real nice.You start out as a 10 year old boy and then after 3 levels you travel through time and become an adult. Hyrule has changed and you need to save the land. You go through many levels and bosses to finally get to Gannon, the ultimate evil here. He is an improvement on the previous Gannon of previous Zelda games(looked like a little pig then!) and fighting him is more challenging and engrossing in this new game.

Glammondwarf (the villain) was so cool! He snuck into the Secret Realm behind Link and stole the Trueforce of Strength!! Pwned!The Prince Zeldo person was really weird. He/she was a tranny who turned into some guy named Shaieke, who kept stalking Link on his journey. Then he/she would change back into an elf girl in a dress. What a creep! But Zeldo had the Trueforce of Smartness, so I guess that character was okay. Zeldo had this tall white-haired ninja lady named Inca as a bodyguard. Inca might have been a man too though...I'm not sure. She looked kinda like my aunt Helga.The Link character was really cool! Link wears white tights, a green toga, and had a grappling hook device! He also has this little firefly thing called Navely that follows him around! You begin the game playing Link's little kid brother, which kinda sucked. I can't pwn Goombas with a little midget (Goombas are these big skeleton guys). I think the kid brother is supposed be Peter Pan, after he killed Captain Hook and left Neverland (maybe they have another game about that part).But later you get to play Link, who is an adult elf with a pointy nose. He has the Trueforce of Braveness, so that means he is very brave. He can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures! I wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates? Later on, Link gets the Bassoon of Time and can play it to make it snow! I think Link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks. He just goes Ugh! Hiyah! AUGHHHHHH! and stuff.I think he might be a cannibal (or vampire) too, because he eats hearts to gain health. There is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when it's time to feed.You pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with. But they look really big, so I wonder how Link can carry so many in his pockets? And if you don't pick the rublees up soon enough, they begin flashing and disappear! I guess they're like...big holograms or something, like in Star Wars. Why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks? I really wish I could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like that.There are these fish people named Zurros. They have this giant jellyfish named Mr. Jabba Jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fish-man! I think it was the Zurro king's pet and he lost it. But you have to carry it all around Mr. Jabba Jabba's stomach, so it's kinda annoying.Then there are these big rock guys called Gordos that like to roll down mountains! They are my favorites because they live in this mountain called Doom Mountain. It explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you! Holy ****!That evil Glammondwarf guy is a member of the Garundo thieves. They are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach. But they don't have any men in their race, so I don't understand how there are so many Garundos? Maybe some of them are trannies, like Zeldo. I think Glammondwarf might be one. He kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughs.Sooooo all of these people live in this magical land called Hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters. I think it's supposed to be kinda like Toon Town from Roger Rabbit. It's such a huge place! It takes forever to ride across it on Link's horse, Ramona! That's right! You get a horse! Link steals it from Mario and Luigi at some ranch. So I guess Link is kinda a thief. Maybe he's really one of those Garundo thieves? He does kinda look like a girl. But he's not a ginger, so I'm not sure.Aaaanyway....play this Bassoon of Time game! It is full of so much WIN! I hope I didn't give too much of it away!

I'm a newcomeer to the Zelda series, so I'm not too sure how Ocarina rates with the others, but I love it. For an Nintendo 64, the graphics are absolutely beautiful. The lighting rivals that of a Playstation 2 or Xbox or Game Cube. The sound is terrific. Each different sound effect was done in detail. The sword against stone and the sword against wood are not the same as in a lot of games and sound just like they should. The echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and Link's footsteps are done perfectly. The puzzles are challenging, but not so that you want to through the controller down in frustration but so that you won't put the controller down until you've figured them out. The minigames and the sidequests will keep you playing long past the time you've beaten the game itself because they are so plentiful. The controls take some getting used to but are perfect for the game's combat system. The targeting especially helps the later you get into the game. The music is captivating and is very well done. Overall, I think this is one of the best games ever, not just in adventure.

67,A3OMBKL5EOHA36,B00000DMB3,Jami Blackann,"[7, 8]","Unless you've been living in a box your whole life, chances are you've heard about what an incredible game this is. Nay, I will go as far as to say perfect. Even if you haven't grown up with the Zelda series, you're still likely to find this game quite enjoyable. It's safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary, and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all time.The story begins as a young Link awakens in a small tree hut. Staying true to past games, you start off with no items or weapons. You soon learn that the Great Deku Tree wishes to see Link, and thus you set out to explore Kokiri Forest. Upon taking your first steps outside, you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest. While you search the area for a sword, you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment. Once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items, you head for the Great Deku Tree, accompanied by your faerie friend Navi. After completing this first dungeon, the Deku Tree explains the history of the Triforce and rewards Link with the Spiritual Stone of the Forest, thus setting the story in motion.The graphics of this game are fantastic for its time. You can now journey through a fully navigable 3D map. The details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting, be it a forest village, a watery temple, a haunted underground maze, or the inside of a giant fish's belly. The map of Hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore. The cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together well.I absolutely love the controls in this game. Everything is pretty intuitive: the A Button is used to execute actions, the B Button swings your sword, and the C Buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play. You're able to roll and jump, swim and climb, block attacks, stab, and build up power for swing attacks. But the greatest addition to the control features is the Z Targeting ability. This function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object. Moreover, this button will focus the camera directly behind Link, allowing you to have control over your point of view. To this day, I compare games' camera controls to Ocarina of Time, often wishing for that very desirable Z Targeting capability. A great addition to your supply of character controls.The story itself builds upon previous games in the series, for we interact with familiar characters like Zelda and Ganondorf in addition to many new individuals. As always, there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels, some that are familiar and some that are new to this title. What makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time. You begin the story as a child, growing as a warrior and searching for the Spiritual Stones. When you travel into the future, the world has become darker and your missions more challenging. There is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests. The multitude of puzzles, games, and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining. The endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich, enjoyable plot, furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aid.And the game would not be complete without sound. Again, Ocarina of Time gains a perfect score here. The sounds that Link makes when he fights, moves, and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable. The echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in. Likewise, the soundtrack is just as appropriate. Each level has a different musical score, and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings. Also, some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games, transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic, yet new. The ocarina songs are appealing as well, adding another interesting component to the gameplay. Ocarina of Time really has a wonderful soundtrack, and even today I still enjoy listening to it.All in all, this game is truly a classic, and yet another impressive sequel in the Zelda series. From the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack, Ocarina of Time is a gem in the adventure game genre.",5,Extraordinary!

Oh, undeniably, but that is not the point. My point is that it was the best game for the Nintendo 64, with Super Mario 64 and its direct sequel, Majora's Mask in a second place draw. It shows how the franchise began. Link sets off on a journey to save Hyrule from the evil Ganondorf for the first time. He meets Princess Zelda on the way, and when she flees from Ganondorf, she leaves the Legendary Ocarina of Time in Link's possession. He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword. The graphics were neat for the time, the storyline was really exciting, and there is a lot of stuff to collect. The dungeons were challenging, and the boss fights are neat. If you are a fan of Nintendo, please pick this up.

70,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B00000DMB3,jmpg,"[0, 0]","With almost three years in the making, how did The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time stand the test of time itself? As a prequel to the entire Legend of Zelda series, it has caught heavy anticipation. Ocarina is a prequel to the events before A Link to the Past. Link is a child, whose destiny is to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon (Gannondorf here) by traveling through time. You'll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow Hylians, Kokiri, Zoras, and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save Hyrule. Ocarina of Time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along. In the end, the game is an Action/RPG, and should never be classified in the style of traditional, turn-based RPG's (like Final Fantasy).New additions to the series are automatic jumping and Z-targeting. The emphasis of the Zelda games has always been puzzle-solving and dungeon arrangement. You also build your attributes, receiving items including the Ocarina, learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling. Along with mini-games, hidden items and side quests equal, its a worthwhile experience. Graphics-wise, Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding. No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates, but rather focus on detail and designer talent. The real-time cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive. The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format. The themes of Zora's Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears. Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zelda's Lullaby. A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback.In the end, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time makes the cut. Even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeon-dwelling and puzzle-solving, the impressive graphics, quality sound and everything that's been obtained from previous Zelda titles will keep fans and non-fans alike entertained. It's fun.",5,Link grows up,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",0.2152
71,A8N0WM620H8RP,B00000DMB3,John Salerno,"[0, 1]","Ok, I figured I'd throw in my opinion as well. Mainly, this review is for people who have not played the game yet and are wondering if they should. Perhaps you aren't too into RPGs or whatever, so it is my job to convince you! First off, it's more of an RPG/adventure combination, since it doesn't use conventional RPG techniques like turns or experience. But that is a good thing, because the way the game is structured allows for near-total freedom as you play it. Yes, like some people have said, you must beat the dungeons in a certain order, but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want, and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more. It is truly the greatest game I have ever played, that is no exaggeration. The graphics and the sound are wonderful, the puzzles are NOT as easy as some people are saying -- the Water Temple is maddening! -- and the character development and depth of play is unmatched.Majora's Mask is almost as good, but what makes Ocarina of Time better, in my opinion, is the fact that it is sort of the &quot;ultimate&quot; Zelda game, meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of Link and Zelda and Ganon, and it is a completely stand-alone and definitive game. Majora's Mask, on the other hand, takes place right after the events of Ocarina of Time and has a very different structure. The three-day cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game, but the only downside is you can't take your time and relish everything like you can in Ocarina of Time.Either way, though, Ocarina of Time is a beautiful game.",5,Truly the greatest game...,1007337600,"12 3, 2001",0.4418

I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didn't have my memory card yet. This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant, ominous, beautiful, and haunting. I had never experienced anything like it. To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game.What's really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent. The music is also exceptional. The music is better than most movie soundtracks, in my opinion. All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game. So much happens in this game; it has a lot of cinematic scenes too, which really develop the story, which is an excellent tale of good versus evil.Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of. There are a few films and books that would come close, but I can't think of anything that could quite surpass it. Ocarina of Time is an involving, authentic, scary, and epic adventure.

It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests. It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny. He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule. Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree. He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him. Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest. The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule. But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones. Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him. But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water. Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce. Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up. Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.

Look no further than the game that changes everything that went before it. Yes, certainly other games can compete graphically with this, but innovation is an entirely different proposition. Zelda, then, innovates on an unparalleled scale. Weather, night/day, age, all real aspects which merely touch the surface of this monumentous achievement.To be really honest, there is no real weakness with this game. No puzzle will stop you in your tracks. There is ALWAYS something to do. In fact it will take you a lot longer to find everything the game has to offer than it would to finish other games. And this is where the distinction comes in. You can label this as an adventure game if you like. But, it is beyond comparison with everything else. Thus meaning that it should be catagorised in a genre by itself. Or at least as a game that redefines an entire genre.There are no comparisons.

93,A3LGY4B4JQRR2E,B00000DMB3,Martin Alther,"[3, 3]","I remember all the hype surrounding The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina Of Time like it was just yestarday. The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system, and with the power of the soon-to-be-released Nintendo 64, the series was finally going to reach its next step: the third dimension. This (along with other titles like Super Mario 64 and Mario Kart 64) got both gamers and the press excited about the N64 and the upcoming Zelda game. While the Nintendo 64 never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype, but in many ways surpass it.What makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game (that I've played) where you truly feel like a part of its world. Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat, including previous Zelda titles, but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right. Even the later Majora's Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did.Much of the game's feeling stems from the interactivity of its world. You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see. For example, many of the game's locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies (as well as hear some pretty haunting music). Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony, however, you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning. I won't go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it. Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction. Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were? In TOOT, each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish him/her from the rest of the game's characters as well as once again feel like you're a part of Hyrule. And of course, the third dimension (the dimension we live life through) helps the game a great deal.The gameplay is equally great. I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one, which is especially helpful in the game's dungeons which often require you to use several different weapons/items. Speaking of which, the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played. And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon, you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss, rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas (this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past, where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda). And of course, the game's graphics are among the N64's best (not necessarely because of how detailed/realistic they are, but how carefully crafted and full of life they are), and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game (even with the Star Fox 64-quality midi samples).In brief, The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game. If you own an N64 and have not already picked this game up, I strongly suggest you do. If you do not even own an N64, than the system's worth picking up just for this one game and its semi-sequal Majora's Mask.",5,May Very Well Be The Finest Video Game Ever Released.,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",0.4542

One is a review of the title, and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic (and my personal favorite Zelda game), THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST. Rather than leave them unposted, I issued them on Amazon back in 2007, one article on the Collector's Edition (Zelda 64 a Remake? and and one on the Regular edition (an actual review of the game). When the 3DS version came out, I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content. Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up.Mike London, 9-9-2012-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This commentary on Ocarina of Time was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999. I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it. Mike London, November 3, 2007Article 1: Does Zelda 64 really live up to all the hype?[Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT. Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best? Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance? Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history. In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet. There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry. Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage. Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie. And they have one thing in common. They're both eye candy. But how do they hold up to the rest of the series? In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie. But what about OoT you ask? How can I defame such an instant classic?One reason mainly. In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can't speak for Zelda II because I haven't beat it yet) the ending was spectacular. Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon. Ah, the last dungeon. Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda. That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol' Gannon. It was truly a great dungeon. Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version. What have we here? A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda! Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon. Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way!Then, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda. The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd. But guess what! No end dungeon! In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II). You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish. Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII). That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon? No where to be found here. Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol. So that offence is not to serious. And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.After five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64. So cool! Link in a 3D adventure. About time too. Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96. Of course, I bought the game. And of course, I beat it. It is an excellent game. Truly it is one of the great classics. But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past. The end dungeon absolutely sucked. That is my only disappointment with that game. As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon's tower. I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past.[Spoiler: If you haven't beat the 64 version of Zelda, don't read this]What did we get? Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers. What did we have to do? Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway. And what did I get? A great disappointment. Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible. The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable. That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series.[Spoiler Finished]Others say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game. I have to disagree. Don't get me wrong. It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64. It's a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right. But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game. LTTP is huge. It fully utilized the SNES technology. It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever. That's one more than the original has. (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.) After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon. There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also. Overall, for the system's capabilites, LTTP is my favorite.But what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT? My two chief complaints are these:1. Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above).2. Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.All other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld. But what have we in OoT? A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field. Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen. For all the time they put into it, you don't think it would be to hard to correct this problem.Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda. Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme. They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age. That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series. And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT? The Overworld them from the original LoZ! I couldn't believe they did that! Hopefully we'll see it in Zelda Gaiden. Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too. Just a thought.Now, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game. Quite the opposite, really. It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series. (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article). But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance. Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above. It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it. It provides a lot of enjoyment. But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype? I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually.[May 9, 1999. An article originally written for NintendoLand.com. I've written four released articles and one unreleased article (dealing with SMB 2). It will have to be edited. Also, perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article.].....--------------------------------------------------------------------------Article 2:[Originally this was written for a retro-gaming site back in early January, 2000. It has never appeared on Amazon.]Zelda 64 a Remake?[Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake. Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I've noticed something very intriguing about it. It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past. Why do I say this? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.Lets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP. This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple. Well, this time around, you don't rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her. After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped. This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones. After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu's belly. I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town. Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf. Hmm . . . haven't we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage's medallions. Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away. Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf. How intriguing.In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That's great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple.Okay, what do we have in Zelda 64? You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link. Guess what? Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.* Hmm . . . isn't that what we did in SNES Zelda? Why, I do believe it is, Watson!Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that's the same in Zelda 64. He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; )The real question is why did Nintendo do this? Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense. Again, another article, another time. The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening. Who knows why they chose to do that? Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same. In review:A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 641. SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda. This is to get the Master Sword. Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped.2. N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones. Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped. He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is. Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called. Is given first Sage Medallion.3. SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World). Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.4. N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world. One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult. This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal. Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.When he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon's power has grown.5. SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon. Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.6. N64: One version (Young Link's world) is not corrupted by Ganon's evil. Ganon has just recently showed up. Version II (Adult Link's world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link's world. The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it's the time barrier. But for game play, they're the same.7. SNES: He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical). With the maidens' power, they will open to door to Ganon's castle.8. N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon's Tower.9. SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower.10. N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower.11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped. Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals.12. N64: Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda. There's a shocker.13. SNES: There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link's Awakening also.14. Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do.15. SNES: In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.16. N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess. Yoshi also comes up. Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also. Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos.As you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few. If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that's what he should have done, I suppose. This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed. Its like they took the game's basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand. And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex. But I love Ocarina of Time all the same. This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company.*In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains. This is the first game in the series to break that trend. The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain. Link's Awakening, Link's only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains. At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.",5,Does Zelda 64 really live up to all that hype?,1193961600,"11 2, 2007",0.0711

We all know that Golden Eye 64 is impossible to top, but this comes damn near close.Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic. Five stars plus. Matter of fact this is the best Zelda release I have ever played. And I have played them all.The graphics really show what the Nintendo 64 is capable of putting out along with other classics like Mario 64 and Golden Eye. The graphics are amazing and are top notch.The storyline is even better. Most good RPGs have more than just one single character. This game however only has Link and still manages to become a classic like most of the other Zelda titles. No this game is no Final Fantasy IIV, but in a way this game is better. Maybe not as long, but the storyline is a little bit more creative and catchy.Ocarina of Time offers a little bit more &quot;extras&quot; than the previous Zelda titles have to offer. You can collect extra items along the way for personal score to see how good your discovering ability is, and not just finding pieces of hearts. There are so many secrets with this game.I would suggest you dont use the strategy guide until you have completed the game. If you do, then you are cheating yourself and making the game not even worth playing. Beat the game and then look at the guide to see what you have missed.Overall, I spent a lot of time on this game. I could have beaten it a lot faster, but that wouldnt be any fun, because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itself.Buy the game and see for yourself.

103,A37166GI3OOCZO,B00000DMB3,nafysmiley,"[4, 4]","Ocarina of Time is a massive, epic Action/Adventure game out for the N64. Many have been tempted to call it the best game ever (just read some other reviews) but I would step back from that. It is still one of my favorite games, despite the fact that I play mostly RPG's. By the way, Zelda is not an RPG, even though you do talk to people and have a sword.In Zelda you play as Link (Zelda is the princess, not the main character) as you go on a quest to save the world from the evil Ganondorf by freeing each of six spirits from their different temples. You change between times, where you are adult or child Link, and you have to switch often, and do different things in both, and each time has different weapons and items. The time-traveling aspect of the game is one of the coolest parts.The real-time combat is a lot of fun, and fairly well put together. It involves a 'Z-targeting' system in which you can select a monster and then keep it in the center of the screen and move around it. The fights against other monsters with swords and shields are great as a result. Z-targeting is not perfect, but it works well.The dungeons are all awesome, and very unique. Each dungeon is mostly based around one particular item or weapon, its own gimmick, but despite that they really don't seem forced, and stay fresh all the way through (although, the last couple dungeons aren't nearly as long as the others, almost like the designers started getting bored). For the most part the dungeons aren't too difficult if you know what to do, but it is very easy to get stuck if you don't, and the game often leaves you on your own to figure out what to do, especially on side quests, so having a good walkthrough nearby is helpful.The overall story isn't too great (for the most part, save the princess), but many of the individual events and side stories are neat. The characters and different races which populate the world are cool, especially the Gorons, which are one of the best races ever. The bosses of each dungeon are awesome, as well as being original, and can usually be beaten by hacking them up, or through the use of special tactics. It's always good to have a choice.Despite how good it is, Zelda isn't perfect. The graphics, for example, are nice, but they are old, and on the N64. The music is okay, but mostly just ambient, and the classic Zelda overworld theme is conspicuously missing. Having to constantly change which items you have equipped is also annoying, even if there isn't really a better system available. Some would say Zelda has an almost kiddy atmosphere and suffers from an occasional lack of seriousness (I would tend to disagree). And of course, the fairy is annoying, but no reason to like the game any less.All in all, Zelda is a great game, and a must buy for any N64 owner, as it is one of the best Action/Adventure games ever. If you are looking for an RPG, look elsewhere. This isn't one. And be prepared to get a little frustrated. Zelda is pretty long, especially if you do everything there is to do. Maybe 25-30 hours if you run straight through, but it could take many more depending on how much extra stuff you do, or how often you get stuck.

From the amazing graphics (for what it is; a N64 game), to the music, to the challenging gameplay, to the engulfing storyline, the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is a must-play for any age. You start the game off as young Link (or whatever you want to call him), who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old. Inside the forest, there is a godly tree, who could be considered to be infinitly wise. The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising, and tests him to the dungeon inside of him. Link comes out, sucessful, and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising. From then on, you play young Link, and must overcome many obstacles. As a child, there are 3 dungeons, and the tree's counts as one, so you're making some time, right? WRONG. There's much more to this game then beating dungeons. As a child, you can't acess as many of the things, but after you advance 7 years to the future and attain the Master Sword, many of these things are then open to you. As a child, you got an ocarina, in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things. Now, you can do all those things, and more. My personal favorite is Epona's song, in which you place a horse's (Epona) song, and it comes to you, in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast. As a child, you have weapons like a stick (whoopey), a sword, a shield, a sling-shot, and Duku Nuts. As an adult, you can handle 2 swords: the Master Sword, and the Giant Sword, which is so big you must handle it with 2 hands, which means no shield. You also have the hook-shot, Megaton Hammer, bow-and-arrows, and magic crystals you can do different things with. I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is.

Both games have been remade for the GameCube, and I own both the original N64 version and the GameCube version. The gameCube versions were released if you bought a GameCube at a certain time and if you pre-ordered the Wind Waker.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: OCARINA OF TIMEThis game started out as you as the Hero of Time. You were the only forest child without a fairy, and the Great Deku Tree sent the annoying little fairy to you. When you go to the Deku Tree, he says you must get these Spiritual Stones to open the Door of Time, and a bunch of other crap like that.Sound and Music: 9.5/10.0 This game has one of the best scores in the video game world, and the ocarina songs are very good. 100% credit to the music makers of all the Zelda Games, these are some great songs. The only problem is you can't shut it off. Sometimes it gets annoying, and it doesn't help if you are stuck on a level for hours.Graphics: 2004: 4.0/10.0 1998: 9.0/10.0 In this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible. If this game was released today, everyone would laugh. Back in 1998, these graphics were the best out there. But the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind.Difficulty: 10.0/10.0 This game is HARD! I beat it barely without a strategy guide, and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS. If you beat the game with a strategy guide, you take the challenge and fun out of it. You also won't have many broken items, like controllers or TV's.Gameplay: 1,000,000.0/ 10.0 It is considered the best game ever, and was the 1998 Game Of The Year. You could do EVERYTHING in this game, and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap. This game is like no other. No other game can match this, none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it, it is the best Nintendo game ever made.THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: MAJORA'S MASKThe game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule. No Ganondorf's in this game, because it revolves around Majora's Mask, a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT. You have three days to get the mask back, but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time.Sound and Music: 9.5/ 10.0 It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time, and the suspensful music is very catchy. The game has great music, ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC.Graphics: Same As Ocarina of TimeDifficulty: 9.5/10.0 Not as bad as Ocarina of Time, but that doesn't mean it is not frustrating and challenging. You can't be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great.Gameplay: 10.0/10.0 The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games.

Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 needs this game. This game is pretty old and pretty cheap(I lost my game so I baught one for 5 bucks at Gamestop)so it won't be hard to find. This game infact shows what the Nintendo 64 is capable of. The game is very well made as you play through a huge world...well not that huge.. And I will say this..(I may be exagerating this though) But the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time has one of the best boss battle finale ending ever..Ubelievable..Graphics in this game a superb. There were parts in the game were I would just stand there and stare at the ocean, houses anything cause it looked so beautiful. I loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look. Nintendo scores big with the graphics. The gameplay is magneficent. I loved how it was all made and done. I really can't get into this one, you'll just have to play this part for yourself....The sound is..My god...It's beautiful I even downloaded all the songs.

One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history, second only to that of Mario and Bowser. You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man. Along the way, you will fight many monsters, explore dungeons and temples, rescue a horse (great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly), engage in numerous side quests and mini-games, learn many different tunes for your Ocarina, pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items, meet some gorgeous fairies, and in short, have a wonderful gaming experience.As with the other Zelda games, this one is filled with different puzzles of various types, most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game. They are engaging, but not too difficult to figure out, for the most part. There are a few, though, that I had a tough time with. Not to fear, though, there is plenty of help out there, both in books and on the internet, to aid you through those difficult spots. The controls are wonderfully intuitive. Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario 64 (and the game does, at times, suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did), and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself.The Z-targeting system is excellent, once you get used to it. You don't really need it for some of the early monsters, but by the time you become an adult, it will be essential. In addition, you have a little fairy buddy, Navi, who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task. Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game.As I mentioned before, there are a number of side quests throughout the game. They're not essential to finish the game, but they are a lot of fun, and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier. One word of advice - when you reach Lake Hylia, be sure and talk to the two scarecrows! Later in the game, you will be glad you did. Also, be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars. They have many useful items, but they are also VERY expensive, and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game. Also, be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword. Don't say I didn't warn you...Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game, your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one. The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area, which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule. These secret areas contain goodies that you really don't want to miss out on.All in all, an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N64 to great effect. Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan. But, don't take my word for it - pick it up!

But you guys out there that is starting a new adventure, would last forever for no boring parts of the game. There is a lot of words to say, but its worth it.4.Fun-This game is a 99.8 fun game, in my opinion of course. I am stuck on the Deku tree of how to get past the spiders. See, challenging, and fun!5.Sound-You gotta be kidding me! The Sound and music is great! Different sounds occur in different environments for the better!Listen Closely!6.Overall- This game is an absolute no miss game! Guranteed. This is a good game who likes RPG, or collects Zelda Games. This is, (I think) better than Majora's Mask. This Game Follows the Legend!!! Honestly.",5,The Legend Goes On In This Action-Packed Adventure!,1019174400,"04 19, 2002",0.3961

126,A20MDJ2Q4KL7VD,B00000DMB3,S. Fann,"[0, 0]","Zelda OCT is an action-adventure RPG (there is debate about this, and some argue Zelda is it's own genre) with a combination of puzzles, fighting, and racing. Anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by OCT (which you can play on several Nintendo platforms including the 64 and Gamecube). I still play Zelda OCT 10+ years later on the Gamecube from time to time, it's that good of a game.Graphics:For the time period, Zelda OCT on the 64 was beautiful and it has stood the test of time FAR better than other older games on consoles. It was the first truly 3D game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like. If you grew up on newer systems and PC's, these graphics will look blocky to you, but the Gamecube has an OCT version with more refined graphics. Still, if you want a retro video game experience, the N64 Zelda OCT has graphics that are still enjoyable today.Story:The Zelda story is perfect for a video game, as the basic premise is always the same. Link, a young boy (or young man in newer games), is the reincarnated hero of time. He must battle the evil Ganon/Ganondorf to save Hyrule and princess Zelda by using the power of the Triforce.Zelda OCT molds the Zelda Story into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time. The game's puzzles become progressively more difficult, culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon - the Water Temple. The story combines several races (Hylians, Kokiri, Gerudo, Gorons, and Zora) seamlessly into one large kingdom. The enemies are varied and interesting as well. The Fantasy-Adventure story line is complex and intricate, complete with twists and shocks, time-travel, and genocide. Time affects the characters, and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails. The story details are amazingly deep, to the point that pictures on someone's wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character. I loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the back story by talking to the NPCs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes. The main story is also amazing, with the typical epic sword-clashing adventure ingeniously employed in the Zelda OCT universe. It's truly a master's greatest work.Game Play:The 64 had a simple controller for fun game play. There are only a few buttons, A, B, Z, C-pad, R1, L1, joystick, and the D-pad. The D-pad isn't needed in Zelda 64. This limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations. Although B always attacks and A always does an action, the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do. Depending on the way your character is moving, and whether or not an item is targeted, Link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks (vertical cut, horizontal slash, diagonal slash, spin attack, thrust, and jump attacks). Despite the fact that B, Z, and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves, Link is easy to control and I never had problems getting Link to perform the combination of moves I desired. Link could cut any sign into 5 unique pieces consistently - that is excellent controller response!In addition to the perfect synchronization of Link to the game controls (something newer games like Dark Souls could take a lesson on) the game play is interesting and varied. Although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword, each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons. Link not only totes a one-handed sword and shield, but he also get's access to a sling shot and deku seeds, boomerang, hook shot, bow and arrows, bombs, deku sticks, deku nuts, and two impressive two-handed weapons: a hammer and a sword. These weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games.Although the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons, the game is further varied by magic. Link can wield three types of hand magic, as well as three types of magic arrows. This adds another level of monster fighting, where Link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up.Apart from the impressive array of weapons, Link also packs a varied wardrobe. The stoic hero is far from interested in fashion (I mean, he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap, so he obviously doesn't care about his looks), so each piece has a specific use. You can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits. Some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields, and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes Zelda OCT a great game.Wait, there's still more to combat. Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items, there is also horseback combat. You can ride around on Epona, a fierce, wild, mare who only listens to you, and shoot things with your bow and arrow. There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat.Summary:Zelda OCT is an excellent Action-Adventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game. The characters are interesting, with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover. The main story is fun to progress through, and you care about a lot of the characters you meet. The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun, non-frustrating, game play. The bosses are challenging, requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword.Final Note:If the 64 is too retro for you, Zelda OCT has been remade for the Gamecube with newer graphics. However, the Gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the 64 (understandably) so you will miss out on a large part of what made Zelda 64 great. Additionally, there is a 3DS version, but I haven't played that so I really can't comment.",5,My Favorite Game of All Time,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",0.1587

There is so much in this game that makes it so fun. I absolutely love the side quests. Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time, but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword!Another side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows. This will force you to use all your skills and items, and will really put you to the test. I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon.The ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience. Capture all 10 big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop. You will get the 4th bottle (the hardest to get)Even the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique. While many wouldn't bother to complete it, but the reward is the very cool and mysterious Mask of Truth. Furthermore, this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up Majoras' Mask.But of course, my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest. It is very long and trying, but definitely worth it. This is another side quest many people wouldn't bother to complete, but completing it does have it's merits. For example: there is a very profitable rewards system in play. Destroy 10 Golden Skulltulas, and you get the adult wallet (holds 200 rupees). At 20, you get the stone of agony, which (when playing with a rumble pack inserted) will alert the player when a secret is nearby. At 30, get the Giant's Wallet and you can carry 500 rupees. At 40 you get Bombchus (I know, lame). At 50, get a piece of heart. After that, you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all 100 golden skultullas. Doing this will result in you being able to get 200 rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla. Unlimited money is very cool, although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game.The bosses are great. I won't go into great detail, but I've always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon. There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield. Also, the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat, and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him. The fight has a very epic quality to it, and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it.The temples all have thier own awesome themes, both musically and environmentally. I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning. It has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple, and the open courtyard.The music is top-notch even by today's standards. Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece.There is even a sweet element of sadness in Link's lost childhood, with the loss of his friendship to Saria. The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time.The ability to customize adult Link's appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears, which sword and shield to wield.In short, this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heart.",5,Link's Greatest Adventure,1320278400,"11 3, 2011",0.1887

The best title for the N64 it is, beyond any doubts.- Graphics: I haven't played much N64, but, for all I know, this is the best you can get in the plataform. Beautiful enviroment, landscapes, well-designed characters, different places and detailed textures for this plataform. The graphics are hot, I mean it! And you didn't even need graphics, this game would be great even without them. This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3D graphics plus the lock-on camera, this game will be forever reminded because of that. Approved graphics.- Sound: This game has the best soundtrack ever, if you ask me... Nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score. I really want to find a soundtrack for this game, because both the Ocarina songs and the in-game songs are awesome. Characters don't have voices, except when they scream, when they're scared and this kind of thing, so the voice acting isn't great. But the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.- Fun: This game touches you with a great story, great characters, great songs. You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule, and that makes the game so good that you can't say it's not fun. When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples). The different times you play and the many secrets hidden (I mean it, many secrets, I highly doubt you can get them all!) makes the game even greater, even more perfect.- Educative: I really don't know why this game is rated E for Everyone... I feel like the game has some scary parts (in other words, the cemitery and the Shadow Temple), so it should be rated T for Teen, even though it has no great violence, no red blood (just green blood sometimes). But you parents shouldn't worry about that. This beauty must be taken to your children.Overall, there's nothing to say. I don't know what you're doing reading my review if you haven't played this game yet. This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime (The Wind Waker, the last game in the series, is very good, but it isn't nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time).

However, it wasn't until two years later that Nintendo really perfected the 3-D adventure genre with the release of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.Ocarina is, for lack of a better word, a nearly perfect game in almost every sense. The graphics are great (for N64 standards), the music is fantastic, the gameplay is smooth, and the story is incredibly engaging. Much like the Mario franchise before it, the Zelda franchise (although already somewhat established on the NES and SNES) took a simple character (Mario to Zelda), put him in an interesting environment (Mushroom Kingdom to Hyrule), and pits him against fantastic enemies.Of course, perhaps the true greatness of Ocarina is its balance between the essential gameplay and the sidequests. While this game added more depth (riding a horse, getting items that, while not vital to the outcome of the game, will help you, etc.) than any previous game in history, it also wasn't too complicated (see Donkey Kong 64). In the game, Link has a straight-forward mission and accomplishes each objective in sequence...you only need to pursue the frivolous things if you so desire.The quirkiness of the game is also charming. Along the way, Link meets a talking tree, gets trapped inside a fish's belly, befriends the roly-poly Gorons, and liberates temples that each correspond to some sort of natural theme (forest, ice, water, fire, etc.). The first time I ever played Ocarina, and every time since, I found myself amazed by the crazy and colorful characters that Nintendo came up with for each area of the game.Finally, a great adventure games also needs to have an intriguing plot (i.e. the reason why the Myst computer game series was such a big success while its clones failed), which Ocarina delivers superbly. Right away, you are drawn into the storyline that includes rescuing Princess Zelda, defeating the evil Gannondorf, and bring peace to Hyrule again. I know it may sound cheesy, but without an engaging plot the game would have been little more than a sword-slashing RPG with a few puzzles thrown in.Thus, I recommend Ocarina of Time to all gamers, whether young or old, beginners or experts. The difficulty curve is set as such that you will be able to steadily improve your skills in time to defeat each obstacle before you, while enough really challenging side quests exist that you can also hone your skills to a tee if so desired. So whether you want to fire up the old N64, dust off the old Gamecube (for which a version of Ocarina was released), or buy the game on the Virtual Console of your Wii, do so with confidence that you will instantly be charmed by this amazing work of video game creation.",5,The Greatest Adventure Game Ever Created,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",0.3623
