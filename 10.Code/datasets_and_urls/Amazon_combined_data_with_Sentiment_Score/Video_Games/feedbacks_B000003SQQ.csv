You get to play some original characters like, Bad Mister Frosty, Taffy, The Blob, Bonker& Ickybodclay(My Favorite).If You liked this game then check out, Clayfigter, C2: Judgement clay, Clay Fighter Extreme, Clayfighter 63 1/3: Sculptor's Cut, Clay Fighter: Tournament Edition.",4,Easy Game,1110067200,"03 6, 2005",0.8031
2,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B000003SQQ,Simon,"[2, 3]","Let's not mince words here: Clayfighter 63 1/3 is a poorly put-together game. The game had a lot of possibilities, but everything lacks polish. Characters are missing frames of animation, backgrounds look decent but unexceptional, and the fighting engine lacks the strategy of Street Fighter, the speed of Killer Instinct, or the playability of Mortal Kombat. In any normal world, this would be a one star game.Except somewhere along the way, Clayfighter 63 1/3 is so bad that it actually becomes good. Character design is pretty good, and the special moves and taunts are hilarious. The game is playable - not in any way that it can compete with the above-mentioned games, but it still makes you want to come back for another round, if just to see all the things the characters can do. There's also a bit more value once you unlock the secret characters, though it's frustrating that there's no save function that keeps these character unlocked.Certainly not worth full retail price, but the N64 is dead now so you should be able to snag this game for dirt cheap. Also be on the lookout for the Sculptor's Cut version: this was a Blockbuster-only release, but most were sold off as pre-played games. It contains a hilarious singing intro, 4 new characters, and other enhancements.",3,So bad it's entertaining,1102118400,"12 4, 2004",-0.0992
3,A39OZIQ7FATEU5,B000003SQQ,Skinr,"[0, 0]","Why do so many people love to hate the Clay Fighter series? Okay, even I'll admit that the Genesis installments were far from masterpieces. But this one gets almost everything right.I first read about this game in an old back issue of Nintendo Power, from 1997. It mentioned numerous characters that eventually got the axe; some, like Lady Liberty and the Zappa Yow Yow Boys, were remolded for the Sculptor's Cut released to rental outlets. Another, HoboCop, was gone for good. However, since I only had molasses-fast dialup, I was unaware of these facts. When I saw it, along with a Nintendo 64, in a game store less than a year later, I knew I had to have it. As the first N64 game I ever owned, it may not receive a totally objective evaluation, but I'll try my hardest to be fair.The one thing that immediately jumps out at the player is the self-mocking sense of humor. The moment you see the P in the Interplay logo fall apart into a C, you know what you're in for. During fights, the characters themselves spew out one-liners and funny quips almost as much as they do punches; while this gets repetitive after a while, it still brings on a chuckle or two.As one would expect, the fighters are all made out of clay, and animated via stop-motion. While a few (namely 'Ickybod Clay') are a little uninspired, the rest are a joy to behold, and all are animated smoothly with nary a hint of pixelation. Unfortunately, the polygonal backgrounds, while often funny in their own right, don't hold up nearly as well; they range from decent to horribly angular.The selection of characters is slightly limited at the start, giving you nine clay combatants, but three more can be unlocked. Numerous characters return from the previous outings, including mainstays Bad Mr. Frosty, the Blob, and Taffy. Ickybod Clay and Bonker return from the first game, and Hoppy from C2: Judgement Clay (not making that up) comes back as T-Hoppy. The other fighters include Kung Pow, Houngan, and Interplay's own Earthworm Jim. The characters are balanced well for the most part, and their moves are just as funny as the fighters themselves.My favorite aspect of this game is the control. The N64's controller has its share of detractors who say it's not ideal for fighting games; they couldn't be more wrong. The six-button scheme works in the same way as other one-on-one fighters, but here each level of punch or kick (weak, medium, and Brutal) has a noticeable difference. The combos are also easy to grasp and easy to execute, something that few fighting games as of late are able to get right.The story, as with most fighting games, is so inconsequential as to be vestigial, but it's slightly humorous nonetheless. Basically, Dr. Kiln, who took control of the clay meteor in Judgement Clay, is now trying to take over the world by spreading the clayified state to the whole planet, and then he can somehow control it. I dunno, but you fight him as the last boss.Overall, this game is certainly the best in the series. Anyone who likes fighting games at all should grab this, as it's certainly worth claying.",4,Worth Claying.,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",0.2092

The graphics are okay, there are plenty of characters to choose from, but i think that it is far to easy and that the game had been rushed. The price is excellent and i recommend to everyone that you get this as the price of this game wont be around for long. If you want the best fighting game on the N64 then i wouldnt recommend this, but if you want some fun then this is the game for you",4,Good For The Price,982713600,"02 21, 2001",0.5385
