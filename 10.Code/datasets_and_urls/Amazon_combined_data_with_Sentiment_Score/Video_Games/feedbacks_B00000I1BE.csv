Especially the beginning, Forest Of Silence! The music and sound effects are great and the game story is good. The controls may take a while to get used to but if you like games with a challenge, get this. I think that fighting skeletons gets boring after a while but I think when you get to higher levels, (I'm not sure of this) there will be more vicious enemies to fight for your pleasure. I thought the game could have been a little more...well....diverse and detailed, but where I am now, is awesome! I have to say, I bought this at Fucoland and I had no idea I would like it this much. I rented it once before and I hated it because it was so hard. Really, I just didn't put my mind to it and look where I am now. I'm in the 1st castle! This is a great action-RPG game that will keep you hooked for hours. I would recommend that 10 and up should play this game because of the theme and the bloody scenes. There isn't much of a story to this game but for me, that's okay. But for serious gamers (I think I am but this game is so good that I don't really care about the story) you might be a little ticked off because of the lack of story. There many levels for you to get through and they all take a long time. The Forest Of Silence took me about 3 hours to figure everything out (no cheats no guide no nothing). There are two charaters to chose from. Reinhart and a girl (I forgot her name). Now Reinhart has a sword and a whip to fight off enemies and to destroy other things. I think he is better than the girl because he has a stronger weapon. The girl has a energy ball that takes 2 seconds to charge up. I don't like that because if an enemy is comming towards you, you have to charge. She also has these two....rings they look like. She uses that to slice things, just like Reinhart's sword. There are two modes you can go through. Easy and Normal. Normal is not that hard but there is quite a difference between that and easy. There are some options that you can do like the controls and stuff. As I mentioned before, their isn't much of a storyline but when you start the game, there is some. So that makes the game better. Be prepared to do a lot of jumping.Overall, this game has great sound effects, music, weapons, items, charaters, abilities, an okay storyline, excellent graphics and just a really good play!",5,Castlevania 64 - A New Way Of Castlevania,1005868800,"11 16, 2001",0.1323
1,A36RRLVEBABY5Z,B00000I1BE,Axel Law The Happy Seizure Kid,"[4, 6]","Konami took a bold step into 3-D with this Castlevania installment for the 64. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations, which part of it is because it wasn't the same people (believe it or not) that did Symphony of the Night (PSX). Read on to see why it's a below average game:THE GOODFinally, Castlevania in 3-D! Despite many shortcomings, the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere, which are characteristic of a Castlevania game (at least the newer releases). You can select between two characters (Carrie and Reinhart) that change the storyline somewhat.THE BADI was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most. The controls and gameplay were difficult at best, and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls; Here's where I absolutely loathed it. Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game. Also, the storyline, aside from the two characters' different (yet similar) paths, is really hollow at its core and doesn't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.OVERALLNot recommended. I advise renting the game only. ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN. Otherwise, I strongly recommend skipping it. I'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice. I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines (Genesis); Why?! Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this! Perhaps it's because 90% of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay, when it's GAMEPLAY that creates the game.",2,"Ugh, and that's a Castlevania fan's opinion!",1055548800,"06 14, 2003",0.1716
2,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00000I1BE,Ben Rowland,"[4, 5]","Castlevania 64 offers you the experience of seeing a Castlevania adventure in a free-roaming, 3-D realm. I have played every Castlevania game right back to the NES days, and this is a good addition to a fine series. This is a great game, but not as good as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night for Playstation.To start on a positive note, there is a lot of depth added thanks to the 3-D graphics. You can roam freely, battle monsters face-to-face, and search for hidden items without the constraints of side-scrolling. The control is responsive, and the buttons are easy to figure out, which is good considering the pace of the game. The 3-D worlds are huge, and are fun to explore. The sound is also excellent. You can hear the clatter of bones, the snapping of jaws, and the cracking of whips clearly, without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments.The cons of this game are mostly technical, nothing to do with the graphics or storyline. First of all, the camera can be a servere pain sometimes. It often lingers when you don't want it to, and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad.The control is good, but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements. I remember the first level when I kept falling into the water and dying when I tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch. Also, a map would be helpful. Certain areas look the same as others, and sometimes, I cannot tell where I have been and where I am going. But as I said, these are more technical flaws. They don't exactly ruin the game.Overall, this game is fun, and gives a whole new depth to the long-running series. But as good as this is, Castlevania: SOTN for Playstation is much better.",4,"Worthy of the Castlevania name, with a few technical flaws.",1014336000,"02 22, 2002",0.3954
3,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00000I1BE,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","I was really eager to see this installment in the Castlevania series. Mainly because of it's venture into 3-D. Well, I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. They were able to pull off a pretty decent game and that, in itself, makes it another great effort from Konami. It really reminded me alot of the older Castlevania games, yet in 3-D. Despite others mixed feelings on the game, I really enjoyed it. My only gripe, however, is that it was hard and frustrating at times with its' platform areas in levels. Once I made it pass those parts, it was great. One, in my opinion, that was worthy of my hard earned dollar. Although I love the 2-D Castlevania games a great deal, I do hope they make another game like this one in the future.",5,Castlevania 64 is another great effort from Konami.,1025568000,"07 2, 2002",0.448

5,A2U7ABLSDAITGC,B00000I1BE,D. Lewis,"[8, 10]",This game in my opinion is the best of all the castlevania series so far except maybe legacy of darkness. The soundtrack is awesome. The graphics are very well done and it gives you a sense of being there and actually relaying the fear instead of being dull and boring. Also you have to at least rent this game the cinema scenes are awesome!,5,Castlevania Mania,970531200,"10 3, 2000",0.2692

Years later, I decided to finally try it out after watching videos of it on youtube. I was actually impressed, and wished I had played it years ago. It is fun to play. Although it is a bit choppy in control, and the camera angle is somewhat annoying, this is a fun game.",4,Fun game,1371600000,"06 19, 2013",0.2257

Problem with this video game is that it does get old after maybe an hour or so. Many levels to conquer. I'd only recommend this game to those who have plenty of patience. You know, the SAME kind of patience you need to have while on Ebay just waiting for a posted item's time to run out while them other 'have no-life' buyers often snipe the item YOU wanted SO badly in the last fifteen seconds.

9,A2UAOP0VUA12EQ,B00000I1BE,Sam Allen A zealous individual,"[2, 2]","I used to own this game, and while it is not the game I miss most, I still do think about it from time to time. The visuals are very good for the N64's graphics engine, and the voice acting, though there isn't a whole lot, is pretty good. The control is a bit of a problem, as is the camera. However, this is not a big surprise, for it is the first time the series of Castlevania has been moved to the third dimension. Then again, other series didn't really have that much trouble in the third dimension (Zelda, Mario, Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire, etc.), but you can't always win, can you? The music is awesome (naturally-it's Castlevania!) The sound effects are also good. The boss design is highly unique as well, and most importantly, IT'S FUN! I bought it for a mere $20, and it was actually worth it. Though I have sold it, I might try and purchase a friend's copy. If you are looking for a game that is a bit more simplistic in design than the classic Castlevania titles, then this is your ticket for sure.",4,"It's not quite like the classics, but it does well",1122163200,"07 24, 2005",0.112
