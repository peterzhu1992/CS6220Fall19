1,A2QQ9KSQ44QZSE,6050036071,Javier Miranda,"[20, 20]","I bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience. I was not disappointed. It kept in tune well (which was a problem I saw with other microphones) and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind. I don't mind that it is not wireless, since I wouldn't move around much anyways. Also, the fact that it doesn't have buttons didn't bother me, mainly because I don't mind using a controller to navigate. I do think it could have been packaged better, but I don't fault the microphone for it. Overall, a very simplistic, yet functional, design that works well.",5,Yet Another Great Expansion,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",0.3047

3,A91BVZEDZYEWW,6050036071,MP06011999 RESEARCHER,"[3, 3]","Works great!Another cool thing, even if a song doesn't have harmony (parts for more than one singer) you can still do fake-harmony as all mics plugged in remain active. However, the back-up singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesn't differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part. Meaning = if you're just singing to party, you can use all three mics on any song and they'll all just be treated as lead. Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do. lol It's just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song, but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics. For this reason, we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in. Just don't expect a good score ;-)",5,works with RB3 on the 360,1297555200,"02 13, 2011",0.3729

Bit on the ugly side.I would be wary of compatibility issues with this one.",1,Limited Compatability,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",-0.2553
