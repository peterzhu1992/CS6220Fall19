Solid gameplay, crips graphics, and top-notch sound. But still falls short in some areas. Disc changing can get very tedious. That's one reason why I recommend the DVD version for the pc. But it's no doubt this game will suck you in and keep you sucked for a long time. Get ready to experience a whole new world.",4,An experience,1089676800,"07 13, 2004",0.1222

THAT can be replaced. i really wish they still made games like this.",5,Has Always Been My Favorite!,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",0.3718

I do recommend buying the strategy guide because it's easy to miss alot. Anyways if you like the original Myst you'll love this. Great graphics, only flaws was there was a glitch here and there but nothing major.",4,Buy the game strategy guide as well,1120780800,"07 8, 2005",0.5811
3,A3ZP2A2SWNRCB,B000006OWS,race_of_doom,"[29, 32]","Back in 1993, a little game called Myst appeared. Everyone went crazy for it -- it featured amazing graphics, addicting search and explore gameplay, and it was actually educational. A main part of the game was reading, so it figures that many parents were so supportive of it. It was also, though, terribly spooky at times. You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and still feel a general sense of... well, spookiness.But Myst was in 1993 -- and even though it held well throughout several years (which is amazingly good), it started to be noticed more as a classic than current technology.So how well can &quot;Riven: The Sequel To Myst&quot; hold up against &quot;current technology&quot; and the original classic? By simply making the adventure more intresting, more long, and with more &quot;spookiness&quot; -- an original Myst-cliche that adds drama to the game.&quot;Riven&quot; is even more rewarding than &quot;Myst&quot; so much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless. There's five CDs to the game -- that's clearly enough for anyone to buy this game. Even as it starts out, you better look for clues. The developers made it so that if you do not look for enough information, you could go from one disc to another in less than 20 minutes.The graphics, while nice, aren't the best in the world. Even the control (using the Playstation controller) is sometimes sticky. But believe me, you'll get used to it.It's definetly worth a buy from any fans of the &quot;Myst&quot; era.",4,One of the best search and explore games,969148800,"09 17, 2000",0.2653

I know it's a fact that this game was so big, you had to swap discs, that's the only reason I didn't give it a 5!!! Other than that the game is completely immersive. It puts you right in the world of Riven. This game inspired me to purchase Myst. Part I in the series. I hope that they make more of these games for the Playstation 2 and 3 coming out. Myst III: Exile was the last game to be ported on the Playstation 2. Come on Cyan, put more out for the Playstations!!",4,"Awesome, completely inspiring.",1148256000,"05 22, 2006",0.0934
