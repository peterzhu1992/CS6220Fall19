The graphics were really good for its time, and the play control, while some will probably argue with me, was always accurate and responsive. This is truly a classic game. It had many imitators that hardly anyone remembers these days. Stick with the Twisted Metal series though. You can't go wrong with the amount of destruction this game has to offer.",5,a classic,1174176000,"03 18, 2007",0.2186

Its fun and its cool that they use real locations for the battle, because you get to blow things up and find secret path ways and weapons to defeat your enemies. I have most of all the TM games and I can't wait to have them all, even the games that where made from different game company. Because the game play over all is the same.",5,Yeah Boy..,1366329600,"04 19, 2013",-0.0117

But, gameplaywise, this game excels!Innocent pedestrians, secret goodies, destorying the eiphel tower, while you find and destory these things you take on several different competitors out there and utilize their special attacks to YOUR advantage. ON single player this game is kinda tedious, but on 2p, HELLO FUN. I had a buddy who played this with me every time he came over to my house. We beat the game several times, but exploiting new characters attacks and finding more goodies as we traversed really ruled!IF this game had sound and graphics, and some better storyline, this would be in the top 20 games of all time!ALso Twisted metal 4 and 3 [was not good], get tw1 or tw black instead.",5,"The best TM, the best car combat, one of the best ever",1050969600,"04 22, 2003",0.3011

7,ASHK9LB9MU5ZI,B00000I1C1,isams,"[2, 2]","I rented this game because I am a big TM fan. I'll tell ya', this game is pretty old and doesn't have the best graphics, but it's awesome. The levels are cool. My favorite is Holland: Field of Screams. The characters are awesome too. My favorite is Minion. One of the things that I almost immediately noticed about this game was the machine guns. I don't even know why they give you machine guns on TM 3 and 4. They don't do anything. On TM 2 the machine guns actually do some damage and debris flies off other vehicles when they are hit. It would take a week to kill someone with your machine guns on TM 3 and 4. Actually you would be killed in less than a minute if all you use is a machine gun on TM 3 and 4. If you want a good vehicular destruction game, you can buy any TM game, they are all fun, but I recommend TM 2. It will provide hours of fun, especially deathmatch mode.",5,One of the best Twisted Metal games,999475200,"09 3, 2001",0.1327
8,A3LRIXA76RTRDE,B00000I1C1,John Moscarelli Disturbed,"[1, 1]","Introduction:When i bought my playstation i had now clue of any twisted metal games until I played this one. I never was able to get my hands on the first one but this one is amazing.The Game:Twisted metal is a car compitition almost like demolition derby except with crazy characters and weapons. Many games have tried to copy this gameplay but none could ever create one like this. The competition is held by Calypso and he gets people in search of help to join his competition and if they win through the 8 levels of demolition they get one wish from him. Calypso is all in this for entertainment while the characters are in it for something important.The Good:This game is one of a kind and has many good points. First of all is the gameplay. It is replayable and you can chose from any vehicle/character and take him through the end of the game and see his ending story. All of the characters are unique in an individual way and they each have their own special to terminate enemies. There are plenty of weapons to pick up and fire at opponents like the homing missile and fire missile and napalm. The levels are well designed and there are eight of them to battle through. The co-op mode makes the game especially fun but takes away the story aspect at the end. Also each vehicle makes their own sound when using there special.The Bad:The graphics can be a little bit choppy at times and many of the obsticals are flat. Some of the story lines are not worth playing through the whole game, you just have to be careful who you pick.Conclusion:Overall the game is excellent and is a must buy even if our deciding to buy it now and you have a ps2.",5,One of my Favorite Playstation games,1151798400,"07 2, 2006",0.1222

10,A2XOFC1VUX20ET,B00000I1C1,MattMike,"[3, 4]","Twisted Metal 2 is the best playstation game ever! The levels are fun because they are so different from one another. Each level provides interactive fun! The cars are great and the specials weapons are excellent! The ending movies, like the tital suggests are twisted. I do not find this game offensive in any way and I think it good for responsible kids ages 8 and up. Everyone should buy this game. It is the best of the four Twisted Metal games!

12,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00000I1C1,N. Durham Big Evil,"[8, 9]","Even though it came out a little over six years ago, Twisted Metal 2 still stands as one of PS1's best games and the best Twisted Metal game in the entire series. The graphics are a bit dated by today's standards, but everything else still holds up. The environments are huge and fully interactive (you can blow up the Eiffel Tower in Paris and destroy he gown around the Statue of Liberty to reveal a bikini in New York), and the control was at its peak here in all of the Twisted Metal games. Without a doubt a Playstation classic, this deserves to be in every PS1 or PS2 player's library.",5,One of the best PS1 games ever,1013990400,"02 18, 2002",0.3568

So many memories came back to me while playing this game and it is still a very fun game to play.

16,A8AGY2EHAA4HZ,B00000I1C1,Thomas Peacock Master Reviewer,"[0, 0]","Well here's the lowdown, the twisted fighting, plot, and cars are back in this hit sequel to the best selling series Twisted Metal. TM2 brings you back into the Twisted Metal Competition. But this time, it's a one way trip 'round the world. Battle in L.A. to Hong Kong and leave a trail of destruction behind you. TM2 introduces a few new characters into the fray: Twister, Grasshopper, Shadow, Axel, and Mr. Slam. Duke it out with a wide variety of old favorited weapons to new and improved weapons like the napalm, remote detonator, and the ricochet bomb. Beat all your opponents and you might get a chance to have an audience with Calypso, the twisted creator of the Twisted Metal Competition, and have your wishes fullfilled.Bottom Line: An awesome sequel to an already awesome game",5,Awesome entertainment for everyone,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",0.0053
17,AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00000I1C1,TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore,"[0, 3]","If you didn't like the original Twisted Metal don't bother Reading this review -- nothing substantial has changed in the sequel. If you liked the original Twisted Metal don't bother reading this review either -- there's plenty of new cars and tracks in the sequel. If you don't fall into the above categories, read on. The Twisted Metal story is simple. Each year, a dozen-or-so misfits and malcontents meet for a battle royale in souped-up cars straight out of Death Race 2000. The last person alive gets any wish granted by Calypso, the man behind the Twisted Metal competition. Your job is to take control of one the these cars in a variety of locations and then blast your opponents to kingdom come. Graphically, the game is identical to the original Twisted Metal. On the plus side, the landscapes are richly detailed and the battlefields are complex. On the minus side, the texture-maps still look horrible up close and clipping and pop-in is still plentiful. The game also controls much the same as the original. This means you will eventually choose your ride based on a combination of 1) how cool it looks and 2) how often its handling doesn't make you want to throw your controller through the TV screen. This time around, there are plenty of tracks and a wider variety of vehicles. It appears that Single Trac listened to the folks on Usenet and included cool new cars like a hearse, a bulldozer and a grotesque man/car thing, Axel, that gives me the willies. Also new to this game are &quot;special moves&quot; that anyone can pull off. These include a freeze ray, a shield, and reverse weapons.The game still shines in the two player mode. Life doesn't get much better than chasing your buddy around in a cop car and nailing him with a tazer. In fact, if you are into two-player games, there's no reason for you not to buy this game. Overall, Twisted Metal 2 is a cool game with plenty of replay value if you like beating a game 12 different ways or are into two-player games. It's just a bit surprising that the game looks so much like the original. I guess they decided &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;.",3,Still the same with improvements,1062979200,"09 8, 2003",0.1224
