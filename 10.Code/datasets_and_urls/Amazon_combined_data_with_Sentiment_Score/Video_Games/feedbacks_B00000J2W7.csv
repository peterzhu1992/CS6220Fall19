The fighting mechanics are still awesome and function well, the environments are still cool, the destruciton of your enemies or a friend is still loads of fun. Although this game has likely been forgotten since the launch of its Gamecube sequel, it's still a classic that should not be forgotten by any fighting fan. There's still fun stuff to unlock, like new characters. The only complaint I have against this game is the fact that it feels too easy at times. Still it never gets old to kick the crap out of Jigglypuff and send her flying or Pikachu.",5,AN AMAZING FIGHTER 9.25 OUT OF 10,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",0.101

If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye, Mario Party, Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics, Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see, Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp, Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun, but only in groups.",3,Lets smash something! Then be really bored!,987897600,"04 22, 2001",0.2152

I was a master at this game, I loves it so much, a character I recommend that all beginners should use would be Fox, he is the easiest to use, but he is also very good if you can use him right. Jigglypuff and Ness are not for beginners, but Metronome might be the strongest move in the game.

13,A1YK56DPXS5DFX,B00000J2W7,Carlos Santiago,"[1, 2]","I bought a used version of this cartridge after seeing my 3-year old son being hooked with it during a visit to my sister's.You have 8 characters to choose from with 4 additional hidden characters you can release after succeeding in various playing modes at specific difficulty levels. Each character has its own set of special moves, sounds and taunts.The purpose of the game is to use your character skills and moves to knock off your opponent from the hovering playing field. Damage to you or to your opponent builds up as you hit him/her. Some punches or moves give more damage than others and as the damaged builds up, the character turns more vulnerable to being knocked off.There are a few moves that only give damage and other moves are used to specifically knock off your opponent. This means that you cannot just push buttons at random, it requires a lot of patience and some reflexes to defeat your adversary consistently.The game is extremely simple to learn, yet there are quite a large amount of special moves to master. You will definitely require all those special moves when playing the most advanced levels or when facing more skilled human opponents.I kind of sticked with Mario when playing, for me it is the most well-rounded character, although I'm sure that some of the hidden characters are quite versatile as well.I found out that this game can be handicap adjusted, making it fun and fair for all ages and skill levels.This game is definitely more fun in a multi-player scenario, but it is also extremely fun using the computer as an opponent. You can play a free-for-all match (everyone against everyone) with up to 3 computer (or human) controlled characters, having each one the same or their own unique skill levels. There is also a Team-Battle, where you team up with a computer or a human to face another human/computer team.One small thing I did noticed was some slow control response in some instances, especially when playing the harder levels; it requires a little patience getting used to it.This game is very easy to learn, extremely addictive, colorful, fun, challenging and funny. It has dozens of playing options and many cool sounds.

15,AQAMD65HGUGMO,B00000J2W7,cj the great,"[2, 2]","This has to be one of the best games I have ever played. The whole concept of nintendo characters pounding other nintendo characters into oblivion is interesting, and very fun. The Comical and Chaotic feeling of running around and bashing other players of the field in multyplayer fun. You play as one of twelve characters; four of which must be unlocked. The basic characters are all easy to play with, and relatively popular. They are as follows: Kirby (Kirby), Mario (Mario), Link (Zelda), Samus Aran (Super Metroid), Donkey Kong (Donkey Kong), Fox McCloud (Star Fox), Pikachu (Pokemon), Yoshi (Mario). Most of these should be familiar to the moderate gamer, with the exception of Samus, a popular GB character with Metroid. There are many items in this game that you can collect to boost progress. You can get a light saber type thing, making an adequate weapon for plasy. You can also get a fire flower (Mario Bros), Pokeball (Pokemon), and ray gun (star fox). You can also get a Star Man, making you invincible, and a hammer, letting you smash other opponents out of the match.The damage and knock out works like this: With each attack landed on an opponent, their damage percentage goes up. The higher the percentage, the farther and faster each player will fly after each hit. Players can fall off the edge of the map, or fly too high and fall into the horizon. In single player mode, you fight computer controlled characters on many different stages. You earn points based on how well you do (ie how fast you defeat all the enemies) and what you do (ie using the same move the whole stage). Eventually you can fight the master hand, boss of the last stage. Once you beat him, you have the opportinity to unlock hidden characters, Luigi (Mario), Jigglypuff(Pokemon), Ness(EarthBound), and Captain Falcon(FZero Racing). You also try for the highest score.Multiplayer can be more fun. You basically go through a skirmish against 1 to 3 other players, whether controlled by the computer or a human. The items will apply, and you can turn them on or off by playing 50 multiplayer games and unlocking the item switch. After you end the time limit with more points than all other players / if everyone else is out of lives, you get ranked 1st 2nd 3rd or 4th, and the stats of the game are sent into the game stats bank, which you can look over.You can also practice some of the stages of the game, trying for the best time. If you persist in this, you can unlock luigi. It is always good to get practice.Overall, this game deserves a more than five stars. It is very fun, and it provides endless entertainment.",5,Comical and Chaotic,994636800,"07 9, 2001",0.2072

20,A1RCHZUG27AHLT,B00000J2W7,franticgamer,"[2, 2]","Super Smash Brothers... I remember reading in a magazine about this game and thinking, &quot;Finally a game that's going to be a smash!&quot;. A year or so later when I played it for the first time, my hopes were confirmed. This title is one if the best, if not the best, fighting and party game for the N64. Not being much of a Mortal Kombat fan, because of the blood and gore, I was happy to finally see a game that was fun, innovating and bloodless. No, no finishing moves in this game. :-)Super Smash brothers is exactly what the name says, a smash. With 8 available Nintendo stars to choose from at first and 4 hidden away to be unlocked later, this game is a major intrest-getter. Great Nintendo stars are avalaible to fight with such as Pikachu, Link, Kirby, Donkey Kong,etc. and keep the game fun and exciting. There is a hidden level to unlock and secret options to uncover, guaranteeing that you won't want to put the game down till you have them all.As a fun factor and replay value this game definitley rates way over a five. The game supports up to 4-players at once, making it a great party game. All you need is some popcorn, a couple of sodas and a few pillows and the night is made. You can play with computer controlled characters and also as teams, up to three diferent teams at once. The one player game is very fun and challenging too. SSB contains no blood or gore making it a great title for anyone. Parents will be happy about that matter because I know how some parents don't apreciate blood, gore and guts in a game.The gameplay rates very high also.Gameplay is easy to learn, fast and furious. The action keeps you on your toes and you fingers twitching at the controls. The levels and graphics are smooth and cool. Sometimes during a 4-player match the game will go into slow-motion for a couple of seconds. Some gamers see this as a problem but I think sometimes it adds to the effect of the game. Also some elements or weapons are in 2-d making thme seem like paper but this does not detract from the game at all. Some levels are cute, like the Yoshi level and the Kirby one, while others have a sort of seriousness to them, Fox's and Link are examples. All the levels have some sort of hazard to them like a plane coming and shooting lasers at you or a tree blowing you off the screen, adding to the fun and challenge rate. But no matter what level you play on the graphics a clean,very crisp and the levels are very fun.This title is really great for a bunch of friends or just for yourself and is definitley a game that even parents can learn to play. So that makes it in a way a great way to spend time with your kids too. For the kids, this is a great title for new or experienced gamers. This game is worth every penny of what you spend on it.A party bash, a rainy day, you shouldn't stall , it's great for all. :-) From an owner and gamer, Andrew H.

There's no button mashing or crazy combos in this game, just simple B, A and control stick combos. In a way this is good; its not as complicated, and easy to get started. But it's also bad; there's a limited number of moves.Also, some characters are really useless. Jigglypuff? One Pokemon was enough, but this is even a crapified version of Kirby. Which takes me to number two. Kirby. I like the character an the developers had teh right idea, but hes too strong. Playing against aKirby gets really cheap...I'm sure some of you know what I mean. His brick can protect him from about anything!There's only 9 stages...a few of which are really bad like Kirby's, and the Pokemon one's not too great either.

Instead, in this game, there are about nine moves, most of them useless because they do so little damage. This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game. Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly, because of the limited amount of moves. There are also a few too many items, and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win. Also, considering that the gameplay wasn't good enough, the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play, but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt. But I will say that the game has incredible graphics, each character and scene developed beautifully. I also like that in practice mode, you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion. You can make the characters go at normal speed, or one-fourth of it, making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense. The two challenge rounds are also a challenge, maybe too great a challenge, especially with characters like Yoshi, who don't get a jumping boost, but an egg to throw. The bottom line is, this game is simply a rental, because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game. If there were more buttons on the N64 controller, and the game had more play modes, this game could have been pulled off very nicely, but for now, it's just a short rental.",2,The least amount of replay value in an N64 game ever,973555200,"11 7, 2000",0.1528

The controls were hard and there were too many moves to remember. But once you get around the learning curve, which only took a day or 2, the game is a great ride.The thing about the game is that it has everybody's favorite Nintendo characters in one game. It doesn't even skip on the moves. You can throw Link's boomerang, Samus Aran's morphing ball bombs, Mario's fireballs, Jigglypuff's sing, and many other characters moves. The graphics for the game were excellent at the time and still look better than any N64 game except Mario 64.Not only do you have every characters special moves is that almost everybody has their own level and music from their game. You can fight on a Pokemon Center, the Great Fox, Brinstar Depths, or in Dreamland to name a few levels. The only characters that don't have their own level or share one with another character are Ness, Captain Falcon, Jigglypuff, and Luigi. It also has weapons from each characters game. The Bo-ombs, Ray Guns, Poke Balls, Hammers, and others. If you don't like items then you can turn them off which is another cool feature.Another thing about the game is that you have to unlock half of it. You have to beat the game with everyone which makes you appreciate each character's strength and weaknesses. Yoshi doesn't have a triple jump so you have to play to that weakness while Kirby has about 7 jumps which a strength. You have to learn to take advantage of your enemies weaknesses. If you see Samus charging up be ready to reflect it back with Fox.The best thing about this game is that you have to unlock half the things yourself. You have to unlock characters and levels. It is fun, especially since the single-player is great fun.What do you do after you unlock everything? Play multiplayer mode of course which is the best part of the game. You and up to 3 friends or AI duke it out in a free-for-all. Don't like playing by yourself, you can set it to teams with up to 3 teams(red, green, or blue) and fight that way.

The controls are extremely precise, and it's possible to execute combos to near perfection. Indeed, combos are key to this game, something most players seem not to understand. Melee seems to have been created to eliminate combos and reduce fighting to random hacking and button-mashing; this is perfectly suited to mentally deficient monkeys, but humans with brains might prefer something that takes a little bit of skill.

There's even a new level (Mushroom Kingdom Classic.) I hope it helps you :)[EDIT] Here I was nice enough to post everything for you:Cheat: 999%There are two ways to to do this, you must pick Mario as your character and you must go to Hyrule Castle as a stage (you can fight any opponent you want). At Hyrule Castle, get your chosen opponent to the top wooden platform, and then push him or her off of the platform on the left side. Then, spawn as many green shells as you can on the right side of the platform. From here, go to the middle platform and go to the edge of the left side, facing left. Do Mario's Up + B move - if done correctly, your opponent's percentage will go up to 999%. Then, simply wait a second, and knock your opponent off the screen. The other way that takes longer, but is easier. Just select any chracter that shoots projectiles, like mario, luigi, and fox then keep hurting your opponent at the practice level of any selection until they get 999% and after hit the opponent and see them fly like a missle.Unlockable: Mushroom KingdomTo unlock the Mushroom Kingdom beat the game with all eight original characters. This will open up a level that resembles an old-school Super Mario Bros. level.Change Outfits:You can change your character's outfits by tapping the four C Buttons at the character select screen. Some costume changes are limited to colors, but characters like Pikachu are also available with a hat.Unlockable Luigi:To play as Luigi, pass the Bonus Practice 1 with at least 8 main characters like the ones you didn't have to unlock. When Luigi challenges you, defeat him and he's yours.Kirby's Power Loss:Everybody knows that Kirby can swallow his opponents and take on some of their powers in this game, but what if you accidentally ate a character you didn't want -- and you want to pursue someone else? Simple: Just press the L Button to pull of Kirby's Hello! taunt and he will discard whatever power he took on.JigglypuffIf you want to get the Pokemon Jigglypuff all you have to do is beat the game one time and then you will face JigglyPuff in a battle. If you beat JigglyPuff you will be able to use her in the game.Unlockable: Item Switch MenuTo unlock the Item menu (where players determine weapons and their frequency), play Vs. mode at least 50 times.Unlockable: Captain FalconTo play as Captain Falcon, you must beat the game on any difficulty with however many lives in UNDER 20 MINUTES. After that Captain Falcon will challenge you. Once you beat him, you be able to select Captain Falcon as a character.Unlockakle: NessTo play as Ness, beat the one-player mode with any character, with the number of starting lives set to 3 and the difficulty set to NORMAL. You must beat the game without continuing.Unlockable: Sound TestTo activate the Sound Test, successfully complete Bonus Practice games 1 and 2 with all characters &iquest; including the hidden ones.

62,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B00000J2W7,Vicente Drago Shaun O'Donnell,"[0, 1]","Super Smash Brothers is one of the most unique ideas to hit the gaming world since first person shooters featured deathmatch. For this game it features numerouse memorable nintendo characters such as Link, MArio, Pikachu, Samus Arron, Fox Mcloud and more in basically a battle royal. The real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle. The action is almost always intense. However I do have a few complaints about the game.1: Character Diversity. On the primary roster Three of the 8 basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe (Donkey Kong, Yoshi, MArio) and then Luigi as a hidden characeter. So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked (a royal pain in the ***) one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe.2: Story Mode: Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights, one on one, an army of characters, tag team, handicap, so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a (What you thought I was going to spoil the ending).So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over, however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend party.",4,"SUper Smash Brothers, a work in progress",1049241600,"04 2, 2003",0.1719

In Super Smash Bros., the creators of the game take all of your favorite, well known Nintendo characters and throw them into one game. You can choose from several characters like Mario, Luigi, Pikachu, Link, Kirby and many more to battle against each other until there is only one left standing.It's a great game to play with your friends and see who is the best Super Smash Bros. player there is. Whether your favorite player to choose from is Samus Aran or Fox McCloud, each player has his or her own special abilities that can help you and your character win the fight.There are many pros to this game that include the vast amount of entertainment it provides with exciting items that appear randomly during battle to keep players interested. You can find poke balls to throw at other opponents, or swords and bats you can use to hit other people. It's a really fun game to play with people your own age, and its what I think to be one of the more entertaining games on the Nintendo 64.The only cons I can really say about this game are that the creators didn't include enough of our beloved Nintendo characters. Even though they had most of them, I would have enjoyed seeing just a few more of my favorite Nintendo characters battle to the death!Overall I rate this game a 5 out of 5 for its creativity, entertainment, good use of graphics, and the sound quality.",5,A SMASHing Game,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",0.6401

Starting with three basic moves and playing with another novice, you can master all of the characters and all of their moves.
