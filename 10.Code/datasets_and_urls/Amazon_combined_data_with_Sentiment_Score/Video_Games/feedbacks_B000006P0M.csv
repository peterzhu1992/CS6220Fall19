2,A1D2G65W3QHBIQ,B000006P0M,Oscar Galvez Oscar Galvez,"[1, 1]","This is an excellent game for spending some time on. I have played it before on a demo cd long ago so that's why I decided to buy it. It's about passing missions and destroying planes, bases, ships, etc. It find it very fun. The missions happen in different ambiences and time of the day which makes it more interesting. You can get new planes with different attributes according to what you want. A great title for the ps.",5,Great game,1231718400,"01 12, 2009",0.2958
3,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,B000006P0M,Strategos The Guardian of Time,"[2, 3]","There seems to be a curse on Ace Combat akin to that on the Star Trek movies. And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable, while the even numbered (save perhaps zero, but zero is the absence of value, right?) are stellar. Ace Combat 6. Awesome. Ace Combat 5. Uneven and over too quick. Ace Combat 4. Perfect. Ace Combat 3. Had half the missions removed for the U.S. release. Ace Combat 1 (Air Combat). Stone Age. And Ace Combat 2...If you're into classic gaming and love the Playstation (and especially if you love air combat games) this is a definite buy. The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful. You have night missions, sea missions, desert missions, high-altitude missions, ravine missions, and oh-so-wonderful city-liberation mission.I've said it before and I'll say it again, there's more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are. Graphics, even low-res graphics, can and should be BEAUTIFUL. And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory. The lighting, the jets, the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky, it's all just beautiful (to me at least). And better yet, unlike other air combat games of the era, everything moves at a rocketing speed. Even when you get close to the ground (where other games look like you're moving in slow motion), the game keeps a great sensation of speed.The controls are uniformly tight, utilizing the analog controls to the full. And you can bank and pitch completely upside down, something that many similar arcade-style games of the time don't allow. The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more. There's also voice chatter as you go, some nice arcade style music, and full voice command briefings (nice). Of course you also hear Bingo! every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too, but that's just keeping with the arcade feel. The enemy A.I. might not be as good as you can get now, but it's definitely good for when this game came out, and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and don't watch yourself.In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game. If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games, you just have to get this game.",5,Take to the Skies,1205712000,"03 17, 2008",0.1881
4,A2329GPAT2XIIZ,B000006P0M,Ultimate Reviewer,"[17, 19]","For the &quot;Ace combat&quot; initiated, this game is a lot better that the original &quot;Ace Combat&quot; for it's graphics and play, although I have to say how much I enjoyed &quot;Ace Combat&quot; too, in the beginning. Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing - a must for the correct deployment of missiles. Missions are plentiful and, in addition to the possibility to select a wingman (or, indeed wing&quot;woman&quot; as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included) you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission, or do the mission without support, as you wish. There are the usual night missions and canyon-runs, and plenty of planes to choose from. Game action is very smooth too. The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great. An enjoyable game!",4,Great fun and pretty realistic!,975369600,"11 28, 2000",0.2732
5,A3JUV281533H2G,B000006P0M,william jager mac,"[0, 1]","My first Ace combat game was Electrosphere or number 3 in 98 so 12 years later i decided to give this one a go. It's a lot of fun, and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better. Compared to 3, this one is a bit more fast paced, but the graphics are noticeably lower in quality.The one quarrel I have, though it is a given for all pre 96ish (i think) PlayStation games is you can't use the analog sticks, which i always used in the third AC, and even though it's just a little stick, not having it really takes away from the flying feel.",4,Fun but No Sticks,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",0.0441
