This in itself should make any gamer run out and grab one - when you compare the price of this to the price of one of the new consoles, you're saving tons of money!What does it do? For some games that work both with and without the expansion pack, it greatly increases the types of graphics shown during gameplay. Pod Racer is a stellar example. Play without the pack, and you get rings and blocky graphics. Add in the pack and you suddenly have lens flare, details of ships racing beside you, crucial information about upcoming turns. It makes the game play the way the developers intended.It's like watching The Matrix on a shoddy VHS tape copied from a friend, and then seeing it on DVD. It's an amazing difference for a very low price.In addition, many new games coming out are so graphic-intensive that they require the expansion pack to even play. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a key example. This is an EXCELLENT game with great extended gameplay, but you can't even start if you don't have this pack in place.It's not difficult to install - you simply plug it in once and it stays there permanently.

36,A3357DTKMQNXL4,B00000INR2,Shaun Aeschliman Gaming Guru,"[4, 5]","The Nintendo 64 memory expansion pak upgrade is not vital for the most part, in terms of plugging up and playing many of the great titles already released for this console. But there are a few titles that absolutely require this upgrade. The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask and Donkey Kong 64 are two such titles for example, that cannot be accessed without this upgrade. Perfect Dark is one such title which offers minimal gameplay and locks players out of many of it's richer features due to the lack of available memory to run all of it's features properly. But I think you'll find that even if Donkey kong 64, Perfect dark, or Zelda Majora's Mask isn't your thing, you'll still be wanting to consider purchasing this Ram expansion for a few key reasons.1)Improved gameplay details. A lot of games weather you know this or not offer very fine gameplay oriented details not available without extended memory. Most games are capable of improved framerate (improves quality of onscreen action. Prevents slow down effects when a lot of on screen action is occuring for example.) Programers can implement more textures and details to environments and characters making things look more lively or life like. AI (artificial intelligence) can be improved and become smarter.2) The second drastic improvement is audio/visual quality. Most people that don't understand how computer games really work or don't know all the technical terms, have a commen misconception that this expansion pak is supposed to improve the graphics in a way that might take the console beyond it's 64 bit capabilities. This isn't true. Rather, the expansion pak improves color quality and helps to reduce the blurry effect of the colors in most games, creating better visual clarity. Much of the blocky character sprites (but not all of course) will appear smooth and less blockish or choppy. With the improved framerate you may even notice how the environment in some games can pan out further while maintaining a smooth look, allowing the player to see further away from the character than they could with the jumper pak....The memory expansion for N64 is relatively cheap now that the console itself is two generations removed behind Gamecube and Wii. And if your still into retro gaming or just enjoy playing the Nintendo 64 even after all these years I would certainly recommend this buy. Even if you never play the games which require the upgrade, I would consider this because of it's ability to enhance visual clarity. Couple the memory expansion up with a Video-S cable, and you will still find an appeal to the outdated graphics of a system of yore.",5,A nice inexpensive way to enhance visual clarity on an aged console,1202169600,"02 5, 2008",0.3925
