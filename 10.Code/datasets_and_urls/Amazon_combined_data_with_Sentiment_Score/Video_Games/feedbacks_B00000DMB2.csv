Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high.But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad! It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission.I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well. Overall, I actually kind of enjoyed this game.",4,Surprisingly fun,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",0.1352

As for the Deathstar mission, the scenery is wrong. In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench, in the game the target is on the ground. But that's not what bothers me most though, After you hit your target it just says Mission Complete They should've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up. That doesn't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied.",2,Not that loyal to the movie,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",-0.1431
3,A2OUKHGJ85XN4U,B00000DMB2,Charles H.,"[0, 0]","I picked this up in a pack of two other N64 games for five dollars at a used game store. Now usually, those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N64 games in them that no one wants to buy individually. However, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N64 games I've ever played.Story: The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe. You're Luke Skywalker, the original trilogy's protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance. You'll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire, protect Rebel-allied cities, and of course fight the Empire!Gameplay: Unfortunately, you never get to wield a light saber or anything. That's not what this game is about. It's a space-shooter. You travel to different planets in your X-wing or one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions.Sound: There may be an N64 game with more audio than Rogue Squadron, but I've never played it, if so (and I've played entirely too many of them :P). There's so much voice-acting. There's lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet, backstories for Rogue Squadron's fighter pilots, and of course in-level communication between the pilots.Graphics: It's a very nice job by Factor 5, here. Of course it looks dated by now, but in the grand scheme of things, I'd say it's aged pretty gracefully. Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect.Replay Value: You get medals for doing well enough in every stage. I'm told that if you get medals in every stage, you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run. If that's not incentive to beat this game 100%, what is?It's clearly a classic N64 game, worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye64 and Ocarina of Time. I'd only that having a decent N64 analog helps.. a lot. If your controller's analog is dying due to wear and tear, you'll have a hard time towards the end of the game.",5,The Force Is Strong In This Game,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",0.1778

Star Wars Rogue Squadron begins somewhere in between Star Wars Episode IV and Episode VI. Let me just say, you'll be visiting place in the Star Wars universe, and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies, which is good with me. The graphics in the game are some of the best you'll ever see on the N64. The music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done.

The first is a race on Tatooine where you fly a T-16 Skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates! The second is the Death Star Trench Run which the developers, in my opinion over did, because the trence is HUGE and it has to many turns. The best bonus level is the Battle of Hoth. The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals. It doesn't take long to beat this game if your good at games like this, but ot does offer a pretty good challenge.

The cheats to fly the falcon, tie fighters, naboo fighter ect all made the game even better. There is even a secret little mini game where you can control a Chicken Walker (AT-ST) and shoot up some droids and buildings in a small space.The only downfall is there is no way to get unlimited heat seeker rockets, so you have to turn on your unlimited lives cheat and keep commiting suicide to get more of those rockets to win within the selected times to get the gold medal to become a Jedi. And there is no nice video's to watch when you finally clock the game. It just shows a quick shot of the ships flying away and then the credits roll... it would be nice to have had a video type of thing like all through the game.Apart from that, this game rocked.. my the Shwartz be with you.",5,I was so impressed with this game,1111190400,"03 19, 2005",0.1756
16,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B00000DMB2,Patrick L. Randall,"[0, 0]","When the N64 system first kicked off, one of its first titles was Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire. Shadows... was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on. It had challenging, yet rewarding, levels and overall solid gameplay. However, it had two marks against it. The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N64 and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards. The second is that, except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again, Shadows... lacks any real replay value. The introduction of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (based on a series of very successful novels) to the N64 environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for action/adventure games on ANY platform.Rogue Squadron focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron, thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy. Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles, the squadron fights 16 regular missions (and 3 bonus missions) ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying 'World Devastators' on Mon Calamari. That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place. The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around. No more static matte backgrounds. Everything is fluid and moves with the player. The gameplay has also been enhanced. Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships. Overall, it makes for a spectacular gaming experience.Rogue Squadron also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability. It awards medals (bronze, silver, gold) for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency. Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions. This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met.There is only one minor quibble about Rogue Squadron. In the game designers' quest to make a very demanding game, they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill. The most glaring example of this is the level 'Raid on Sullust'. Flying as a (supposedly) heavily armored Y-Wing, one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission. However, the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the 12-15 targets that must be hit. With skillful flying, it may be possible to knockout 3 or 4 of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying, but on the life, it's likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than 10 seconds. With only 3 ships per mission, it's impossible to defeat that mission without using the 'unlimited lives' cheat code (which will NOT be revealed here). However, there's no shame in using that code, and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals. So, it's a minor annoyance.Rogue Squadron raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for action/adventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet. Nintendo still gets it, though, as it followed this game with the even more successful Rogue Leader for GameCube. Rogue Squadron is a must have for any serious gamer's library.",5,Quintessential Star Wars game for the N64,1031788800,"09 12, 2002",0.0292
17,AK3DY70GYZB2G,B00000DMB2,Rex Marksmanson HEYO!,"[4, 4]","If I had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing. &quot;Rogue Squadron&quot; pushes the N64 to it's maximum power graphically, which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack (I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother). The gameplay couldn't be more entertaining, I often wonder how my little Nintendo 64 is able to handle all that this game has to offer. The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships. The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level, but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it. Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo 64 game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them. Can't get you're hands on the new Rogue Squadron &quot;Rogue Leader&quot; for Gamecube? Pick this up to satisfy youre urge, if you do own Rogue Leader or even don't plan on getting it, pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experience.",5,One of the greater games to appear on Nintendo 64,1006560000,"11 24, 2001",0.0709
18,A3GRU9732S4V1U,B00000DMB2,Robert Jenkins video geek #1,"[0, 0]","LucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N64 game. After Shadows of the Empire was released, it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level, where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth. LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept, and Rogue Squadron was born. You play as Luke Skywalker, leader of Rogue Squadron, a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy, making life difficult for the Empire and its minions. You play through 16 basic missions, which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back. The missions range from simple search-and-destroy missions, to escorting supply trains, to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities. Along the way, you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft, from the X-Wing to the Airspeeder. Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses, plus each craft has a special weapon, which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions. After you complete each mission, you may be awarded a bronze, silver, or gold medal based on your performance. After completing a mission, you can move on to the next one, or else go back and try again to get a better score. The game gives you a score summary after each mission, so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold.The look and feel of the game is excellent. The graphics are superb, and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels. The sound is also excellent for a non-CD game, although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive. The game is contained within a 3D environment, giving the game a flight simulator-like feel. The controls are pretty easy to get used to, though this DOES take a little practice. Fortunately, the first couple of missions are pretty easy, so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls. The controls are the same for each ship, so you don't have to switch back and forth.As stated before, the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy. But, starting with about the fourth mission, they start to get REALLY tough, with multitudes of TIE fighters, missile turrets, and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down. Expect to die many times before mastering each mission. Getting the gold medal on all 16 missions will definitely take a while.The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well. As you complete missions and earn higher medals, three bonus missions will appear, plus you will gain access to new ships, including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor. There is also a passcode screen, allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options, including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter. There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire! The codes themselves are pretty easy to get. There are several sites on the Internet that have them.It's easy to get immersed in the 3D environment of this game. Many's the time I've found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my X-Wing through a tight turn. For those who like flight simulator-type games, I would say that this is the best FS game on the N64. It's a bit dated now, what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube, but for those N64 fans out there, this one is a must-have.",5,I just love blasting TIE'S....,1006128000,"11 19, 2001",0.3366
