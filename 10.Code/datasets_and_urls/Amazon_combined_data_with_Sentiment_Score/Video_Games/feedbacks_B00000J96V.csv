Kim,"[3, 3]","When racing games were dominated by 'real' simulation Gran Turismo, I just couldn't enjoy first two Gran Turismo games except the fact that I do get to drive my car. That chemistry wasn't just there. When I picked up this gem, I was immediately sucked into it. The graphic was BETTER than first two Gran Turismo games and not to mention its story line. It's simple story, but they have managed to present the 'simple' story with special cutscenes with jazzy music, and believe me, this combination really adds alot to this game.This game does offer variety with two types of racing and four racing team. Not only each team offers various difficulty, but also it offers different storylines. I have especially enjoyed night setting race course, with music which it brings out the essence of each course to its max. May be something's wrong with me for I just couldn't enjoy 'awesome' Gran Turismo games (third installment was very enjoyable)..you might say.. but this game was MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE than Gran Turismo, Don't miss it!",5,"Trust me, You will be Surprised",1006905600,"11 28, 2001",0.1635

The girl in the FMV at the begining is even pretty hot. Lets face it the Ridge Racer is the origonal and still king of the playstation race games. Gran Turismo is just plain too complex to be any fun. You have to play Gran Turismo for hours before getting any good at it. Ridge Racer is just pick up and play, try it out!",5,Ridge Racer R4 is the Best Race title for Playstation,965779200,"08 9, 2000",0.4213
2,A37DLVPKJZGSQF,B00000J96V,Hannibal,"[1, 1]","Graphics: 8/10 - Ridge Racer Type 4 is plausible in this area. The car designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and well-crafted.Sound: 9/10 - Fantastic! Not too much of this comes from the cars themselves, but the groovy soundtrack, great commentator and crashing sounds give this baby a boost!Value: 7/10 - A fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better. But in this genre, we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them instead.Overall: 8/10 - What can I say? I thought this was a blast. It was fun, energetic and speedy. A good instalment to the Ridge Racer series. The cars were brilliant and the Great Gran Prix is the best part. However, Ridge Racer Type 4 loses points because it is simply too much like Gran Turismo and you might tire of its same-old routine. Still lots of fun and recommended!",4,"An entertaining speedy racing game, but familiar.",996451200,"07 30, 2001",0.5446

I can usually play this for about an hour befor getting fed up with the blocklike graphics. Best part of this game, sadly, is the music and announcers. Would recommend for little kids or someone who doesn't care about graphics or storyline.",3,Good classic back in the day racing game,1367193600,"04 29, 2013",0.1811
4,AFN3I0KETK4BW,B00000J96V,Mark Brockman,"[0, 0]","And I say true Ridge Racer because I actually like Rage Racer slightly better than this. R4 is the first RR game to have analog support, but what really makes this game is the excellent track design. Unlike Rage Racer and Gran Turismo, you don't earn money to upgrade your cars, you just unlock cars. That's its only flaw in my book.Those who are complaining about the quality of the graphics...drive faster.",5,The Best of the True Ridge Racer Titles,1095292800,"09 16, 2004",0.1341

7,AS77LVLUSX18R,B00000J96V,Roy Basilisk,"[5, 5]","I have several racing games, including the best of all racers, those on Dreamcast (F355, Test Drive: Le Mans, and Sega Rally 2). I also have the &quot;licenses-galore&quot; Gran Turismo 2 on PSX and Sega GT. Simply put, I have much more fun playing R4 than the &quot;licenses-galore&quot; simulation racers, and place R4 on the replayability level of Sega Rally 2 (my favorite of all).R4 is an arcade racer, so people who prefer sim games (or who &gt;&gt;think&lt;&lt; they do) may not like it. However, as a car nut myself with all these racing games, sometimes having less realism and more fantastic cars is the best gaming medicine. R4 has much variety, creative fantasy cars, and an actual personality (its refreshing to drive a jet-powered racer; or how 'bout that winnable 1-speed 191-mph 3-ft econocar!).R4 offers a story for each of four different race managers you can work with. Like the different storylines in a Street Fighter game, this adds a dose of personality, though you won't mistake these stories for award-winning novellas.R4 is highly recommended to all. It can be &quot;won&quot; by those with lesser skill on the &quot;easier&quot; teams, but even seasoned racers such as myself get a challenge from at least 1 out of the 4 teams (the expert-level DRC-team Grand Prix). Also, note that one can finish a Grand Prix with a few 3rd or 2nd place finishes, but those who do this and think &quot;I'm done&quot; will never see the better cars in the game. And definitely not the Pac-Man car...Buy and enjoy!",5,Great Fun,978393600,"01 2, 2001",0.4823
