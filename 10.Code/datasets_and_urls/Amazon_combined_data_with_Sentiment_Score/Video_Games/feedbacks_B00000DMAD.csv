The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics (note: a 3D card is not required!.) Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions (who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions.) The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics, it makes this a very absorbing adventure. This is one of the few games that I can't say anything negative about.

The graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements. Some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing. You follow the character Manny Calavera, a travel agent for the dead, guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible. For some reason, Manny is denied any premium clients. Whos behind all this? Find out over a 4 year journey from the dusty streets of El Marrow, to the edge of the world and back again. Absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noir-ish music immerse you in the atmosphere. Clever interface and variable controls are great. A very involving game. Not too long not too short. Humor and wit are weaved through every scene. In conclusion, film noir style, surreal visuals, toe tapping and ensuing music, gripping story, charming characters, and challenging puzzles will intrigue all game fans.",5,A feast for the eyes and mind.,959040000,"05 23, 2000",0.1611

And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone? But I gave it a try. Thank goodness I did.Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera, a travel agent for the souls of the dead. He sells packages to the departed for their four year journey to their just rewards, and if he sells enough he can earn enough to make his own trip someday.Imagine the theme of Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun. Add big orange demons, hot rods, killer beavers, cat races, and the grim reaper and you have Grim Fandango.The story is supurb and the voice acting was top notch. It's very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story, but somehow this game pulls it off. Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another.The things that make a good adventure game are all there. Logical puzzles that don't cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them, good acting, good animation, and good code!

It is fun, amusing, original, colorful, and challenging without being annoying. The only games that came close to it may be the Monkey Island series or The Last Express.

It's also thought-provoking, gorgeous, well-written, and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it. One of my favorites that I play over and over again.

No other game has even come close to GRIM FANTANGO when it comes to humor (of all shades and shapes), inventiveness, delicious irony, creative graphics and plain good-ol' FUN!!This is a 10-year old game mind you - yet, it retains its freshness as any true work of art. THIS IS HOW COMPUTER GAMES SHOULD HAVE BEEN - and not the pathetic cookie-cutter products of mega-corporations working in-tandem with GX-card companies...Your character (hilarious and lovable Manny Calavera) is already...dead when you start. In fact he has been dead for some time, stuck in limbo, trying to pay his way to a better afterlife by selling tickets to other souls on their way to paradise. Guess what: corruption is not limited just to this world. And where there is corruption, there is oppression; and where there is oppression, there is always a revolution brewing...Realizing he is being duped, Manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME EVER PRODUCED. Immersing noirish atmosphere, detailed art-deco settings, fast Bogartian dialogs - with a subtle ironic frosting.WARNING: There are known problems with today's faster processors.

10,AFV2584U13XP3,B00000DMAD,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[0, 0]","I still remember when I first bought this game in the 90's and I still playthe game from time to time for both entertainment and nostalgia. As with most of the pc games in the 90's there was no type commands but just the point and click with the mouse usually but still the humor and video cut scenes in the game were more than enough to keep you playing until the end. The short story-plot was your character was a civil servant for the spiritual plane where the recently departed had to stop before making their final passage to eternal rest. Your character for whatever reason had to work off a certain amount of time to clear his debt before going to the place of eternal rest as well. The job was you worked to see how well the person who just died was in life meaning the more compassionate, and humane they were in life the faster to paradise they would get to meaning the usual ways to get to paradise depending on the person was bus, boat, car, and if very high on the morality meter the number nine train which would only take nine minutes for the person to get to paradise. Of course there was more to the game and that is why it made it very entertaining to play. The video graphics are of the 90's era so again if your used to playing recent pc games you might feel the graphics are sub par but don't let that dissuade you from this game. The voice actors they got to do the characters were incredible both in their acting for their characters and their ability to bring the humor and excitement into the game itself. I know while some think this doesn't have the fighting or the action of recent pc games but I still feel that it's one of the few classics that many people will still find very enjoyable to play both for themselves and children without worrying about to much violence of the game.",5,Another Nostalgic 90's Game Greatly Remembered And Loved,1225497600,"11 1, 2008",0.4385
11,A2E212P7MAIA12,B00000DMAD,Richard P. Blessen,"[5, 5]","Grim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition. The hero of the piece, Manny Calavera, evokes the private eye of the 1940's or '50's melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and corrupt conspiracy which may do him in. The difference here is that at the beginning of this story, Manny is already dead, and the events transpire in the Land of the Dead, the place where, according to Mexican folklore, departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter.Blending Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre, Grim Fandango is ultimately respectful of both traditions, and the striking art design is in keeping with this approach, combining Art Deco and pre-Columbian elements. The dialogue, refreshingly witty and literate, draws the player in to the characters and the story, as does the varied musical score, which includes Mexican folk melodies.The characters are for the most part vividly drawn, and due to the superb performances by the voice talent (particularly Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche) are fresh despite their mostly formula roles. One character which may provoke mixed reactions is that of Glottis, Manny's driver. A cartoonish, Jar Jar Binks-like figure, Glottis skews the story in a younger direction (at odds with the mild epithets employed by other characters in a few instances), and while my children liked Glottis, I expect most players will find him either endearing or irritating.The interface in this game is unusual. Rather than pointing and clicking with a mouse, the player controls Manny's movements with the arrow keys, waiting to see Manny's head turn to an object he becomes interested in and clicking &quot;enter&quot; to see what happens. This approach takes some getting used to, and can be cumbersome at times, but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the player's identification with Manny, ultimately serving the story.The puzzles, many of which are multi-step, involve crafting Rube Goldberg solutions to various problems. Some of the solutions are thoroughly counterintuitive (I won't give anything away, but let's just say that objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre ways), and are best solved through aggressive trial and error. Clues may pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process. That aside, the Lucasarts team, especially writer Tim Schafer, deserve high praise for this highly original and literate adventure.",4,Original and Literate,957571200,"05 6, 2000",0.1238

The way all the charters talk hispanic is enough to me laugh out loud.

13,A18DCMQIXOZA6A,B00000DMAD,Spartan7,"[20, 20]","I don't go for adventure games, personally. Ninety percent of the time, I prefer shooters. But this one...man, it's so weird, so unique, and so GENIUS through and through, how can you not love it?Here's the story. Manny Calavera is a low-level salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent day's pay, but it never seems to work out for him. His boss is constantly on his back, he's routinely snaked by a competitor, Domino Hurley, and the right sales never come his way. It's a lousy life to have.Especially if you're already dead.That's the twist; Manny, and just about everyone else in the game, is dead. This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of Mexican/Aztec folklore, with a strong Art Deco influence, with heavy doses of '30s crime noir thrown in. Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals (called 'calaveras'; get it?).Manny works in the Department of Death, trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive. He does that by trying to sell 'travel packages' to the recently deceased, so they can make their four-year journey across the Land of the Dead, until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest. The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car, a luxury liner, or the exclusive No. 9 train, which speeds its passengers there in four minutes, instead of the customary four years.Unfortunately, the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Manny's way only deserve walking sticks at best, which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time. So, he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client.And that's when he gets in over his head.The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist, like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton. The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted, brilliant, deeply twisted, and diabolical like you've never imagined possible. It's also incredibly, unspeakably funny. Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual, make no mistake.Yes, it's an old game, I know. But the true classics know no age, and this is a classic all right.

15,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00000DMAD,tropic_of_criticism,"[3, 3]","Possibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games, _Grim Fandango_ has a charm which is all in the execution. This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed. Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties' beat culture and the style of _The Big Combo_, _Fandango_ is a sensory explosion. Somewhat courageously, it does *not* attempt to make its graphics realistic. Rather, it searches successfully to use its medium to best effect. Like the best films, _Fandango_ manipulates its elements to produce a world unto itself. Its first-rate direction and hitherto unique-to-adventure-games 3D technology points the way forward for the adventure games.True, some of the puzzles are hard, but none of them really seem out of place. Indeed, there is with _Grim Fandango_ a true sense of plot. Maybe the characters don't develop as they do in novels or great films, but, thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing, they do maintain charming integrity throughout.If I have a complaint with the game, it is the interface by which your character, Manny, communicates with others. You choose from among several sentence options, like those old &quot;choose-an-ending&quot; books. It's not a *bad* way to play a game, I suppose, but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing essays, being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it easier to get information out of the rest of the game's cast. As a result, solving problems is sometimes dead simple. Of course, there aren't many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of control of their destinies, but it makes one long for the day when the promise of a game like _Titanic_, with its limited ability to understand unique phrases typed in by the player, might be more fully realized.Some people, though, might like the fact that they exhaust their investigations of other characters pretty quickly. It does speed game play, and isn't as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on your own might be. This *is* a big game, with lots of scenes and lots of people to meet. Speed-of-play matters. So, even if I personally believe there must be a better way to communicate to other characters, I can hardly rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently available.Thus, even if you think you don't like adventure games, you should still buy _Grim Fandango_. Likewise, if you don't have time to play adventure games, you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the end, because the graphics, story, and soundtrack are just that good. This is one of the seminal achievements in the genre, and to miss out on it would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games industry might be heading.",5,LucasArts looks to Mexican tradition for adventure's future,956880000,"04 28, 2000",0.4021
