7,A2YTGRFQC9ZF52,B00000IYEQ,Bill Lumbergh yeaahh...,"[4, 4]","We probably all know about the hype that Pokemon (Pocket Monsters) has received about 7 years ago. It started off as a game that originated in Japan around 1995-1996, and it was introduced to the United States in 1998. A TV show and a trading card series followed. Plush Pikachu dolls were everywhere. I was a big fan of this fad, and I was only in the 5th grade (late 1999) when I purchased this game and strapped in for the time of my life.This is the blue version of the original Game Boy series. Just like in the Red Version, there are Pokemon that cannot be captured (Ekans, Magmar, Scyther, Growlith and Mankey just to name a few), and a trade cable will be required to fulfill catching them all, but here's a little lowdown and some advice to some starters of this game:You are given one out of three Pokemon to start out with (Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle), and note that your first trainer is Brock, who uses the rock type. I recommend you choose Squirtle if you want to take it easy at first, because it learns Bubble at level 8. Bulbasaur is also a good choice, but it doesn't learn Vine Whip until level 13. (I'm explaining the best moves to defeat Brock's Pokemon.) Charmander is not a good bet, but good for a challenge. When you get to Pewter City, however, don't rush to battle Brock until you feel like you are prepared. Metapod and Kakuna give out a lot of experience points so that leveling is easier, and if you catch a Caterpie/Metapod and raise it to a level 12 Butterfree, it can also help defeat Brock as well (with its Confusion skill).If you're familiar with the later games of this series, you'll realize a lot of differences. You can hold only 20 different types of items at a time (including PokeBalls and Key Items). And you gotta love the cheesy Pokemon graphics!Despite some flaws that haven't been perfected until the later games of the series, this is still a classic game.And I'm not a big fan of RPG style games, but this is the easiest and less stressful of them in my opinion.

9,A1Z2LXA6FTXI6U,B00000IYEQ,Colin The Ninja Guy,"[0, 0]","Let us be honest with ourselves. This is an old game. And yet it rocks most hard, say thankee. It's also highly addictive.The point of Pokemon is simple: catch cute, little, animated talking monsters with magic, plastic balls, and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies. So in truth, it's a lot like real life.Plus, said monsters are fully changeable. You can give them a name, teach them special fighting skills, and even control how much they grow. This makes them much better than hamsters as pets go.Plus, its got ninjas! I'm not only talking about a ninja master who uses Pokemon to duel you (I guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff), I also mean you can name you Pokemon things like: Mifune or Hayabusa or Zatoichi or Swordsman with an Umbrella (that probably won't fit). Of course, you can also name it Winky-dinky-do, if it do please ya. But I digress.Yes, Pokemon shows its age among modern video games. But so does Pong. And Pong is still mildly amusing. But without Pong, there'd be no Pokemom. And without Pokemon, there'd be no modern video gamage. And without video games, I'd have to actually face my family, friends and problems, and learn actual skills! So play Pokemon! It's better than Pong, and many other video games. Trust me.

Pokemon Blue, along with Red, was a remarkable feat that blended fun, as well as underlying lessons for many kids. As daunting as the task is, Ash Ketchum must show that he is the Pokemon master and the better of the two, when face to face with Gary Oak, his nemesis. During your journey, you'll encounter Gym masters, fun places to explore, new Pokemon, and much more. A truly fun and epic adventure.This game has many underlying lessons like:* Cities with different colors - many of which I didn't know existed - like lavender, saffron, and indigo.* Exploration - the idea of getting used to trying new things and ultimately carefully looking everywhere to find what needs to be found* Pokemon names - the many pokemon names were cleverly named to highlight its characteristics, like Mime, Diglett, Bulbasaur, Starmie, ditto, Drowzee, etc. My vocabulary expanded and I learned so much. The Pokemon alone are so immensely helpful in making words make sense.* Perseverance - when you lose the battle, it's simple: you just come back and try again until you achieve the mission or catch the Pokemon you want. It's immediately built into the psyche of the gamer. The game makes Ash Ketchum such a relateable and likeable character.The subtle educational aspect of this game is astounding and I'm very glad that I was one of the kids in my day playing Pokemon Blue.",5,The game that started it all - surprisingly very educational,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",0.429

14,A1QXN22NDLTQTS,B00000IYEQ,David,"[1, 1]","It has always been a habit for children to exhibit and swap their card/sticker/toy collections with their friends in school. The premise of Pokemon -to collect and train pokemon - was the perfect fertile growing field to exploit this fascination children had with collecting things. The first exploit was the TV show, where the characters in the videogame were rendered onto the TV screen. When that became popular enough, the creators rendered the full 150 Pokemon into thousands of different incarnations. Pokemon T-shirts, teddybears, actionfigures, trading cards, stickers, watches etc were all created under the slogan: 'you've gotta catch 'em all'... Parents had a rotten time, that's for sure. And it was this capitalistic, persistent, and continuous explotation of the pokemon name which made the name synonymous with childrens toys. The pokemon legacy was ruined by this exploitation, and the videgame was largely discredited as a childrens fad. But before the TV show, the toys, the trading cards, etc..the game stood pure and unspoilt by the impending pokemon-craze which was about to accompany it. Everybody loved the game. Pokemon was revered.In the game you play as Ash, whose one single ambition is to become the greatest Pokemon trainer in the world. To do so you must collect pokemon and train them in battle. To catch Pokemon you need to engage in combat with wild Pokemon (wild animals). You choose which of your Pokemon is suitable for the fight and deminish the wild pokemon's strengh little by little untill it becomes weak enough to be captured. Once caught, the wild pokemon will become loyal and obedient. There's no 'set in stone' rule when it comes to catching Pokemon, if you fancy the look of a Pokemon, then you capture it. Wild Pokemon are scattered throughout the game and you can catch them at any time.To complete the game, you must collect all eight gym badges. Gym badges are given to those who defeat gym owners. Gym owners are professional Pokemon trainers who are hardened by battle experience, and thus, much harder to defeat than normal Pokemon trainers. It takes a long time to collect the badges, because the gyms are sporodically spread throughout the game. Between collecting badges and training Pokemon, you will encounter many RPG elements in the game, puzzles, dungeons, items, etc... The game is huge and difficult and can take over 25 hours to complete. It certainly exceeds the expectations of a game merely designed to kill time on a long coach trip, which was what the GB was created for in the first place. Taking into account that the GB is a very primitive console, the kind of experience Pokemon offers exceeds all prior benchmarks in handheld gaming. It's an edifying experience.Not only is it the best GB game, it is one of the best overall games ever.",5,Best of Gameboy,1117756800,"06 3, 2005",0.035

I had the other two US Pokemon releases (Red and Yellow) and wanted to complete the trilogy again so I searched and found one adequately priced and bought it. (Luckily no problems with it.)Plot: Anyone who's played knows it, but for those of you who don't. The plot is simple, you, the protagonist embark on a quest to get all 8 gym badges, challenge the elite four, and become a Pokemon Master. Standard vague RPG story-line. I was able to grasp it when I was 7, so I assume it shouldn't be too hard to follow. If you manage to get lost you can find an online guide pretty easy now.Game-play:Game-play is simple turn based fighting. One person goes at a time. Pretty normal for an RPG. Players could do team fighters where a max of 6 Pokemon can be used a match, the first to K.O. all of their opponents Pokemon wins. During battle you can attack, switch Pokemon, or use items.

21,A1ZJ890E85VDTH,B00000IYEQ,G. Mcinnis dr. pokemon,"[1, 1]","This game started it all. Maybe thats enough to convince you to buy it- the fact it is the first pokemon game, and you want to see what it was like. If it is not- then please read on, and learn why to buy it.First off- this was the first ENGLISH pokemon game. The original pokemon games were in Japan- pokemon green and pokemon red (not the us version). They had different sprites for the pokemon, and they were pretty rough. When they came over here, pokemon blue had already been released in Japan, which was a smoother revised version of the first 2. Thats where the name blue came from.The graphics? 8 bit. They arent amazing or anything like that- but its classic, like the first mario. The graphics arent why you play. Its fun and original. Thats why you play it. The Kanto story is basically a trainer who choses from bulbasaur, squirtle, or charmander and journeys around Kanto to become a pokemon master, and ends up stopping team rocket in the proccess. After you beat the champion, you can try to catch the legendary pokemon Mewtwo and the legendary birds if you havnt already done so. You can try to get Missingno, the infamous glitch pokemon- but theres not much to do. As far as replay value goes, theres a large amount of it. Different things can be done, and will greatly alter the outcome of the final battle.If you want a nice, pretty version of this game then go with fire red or leaf green, the remakes.

24,AQYKQREOR153G,B00000IYEQ,John,"[7, 8]","Pokemon Blue is a fabulous game with a very original plot, and two main objectives. It starts off with you, in your house, and you're ready to start your adventure with Pokemon, creatures that you catch and raise. You try to leave town, but Professor Oak (a Pokemon expert) stops you and brings you to his lab. There, he has you choose one of three Pokemon. This is a very important choice. I'll evaluate each one for you:BULBASAUR: A strong grass type Pokemon. The first two gym leaders are extremely vulnerable to his type, so he is undoubtedly a good choice. He also has a secondary type of poison, which can be a helpful feature. I highly recommend him if you are new to this game.SQUIRTLE: A very strong water Pokemon. He is very good against the first gym leader, but not the second. He is my personal choice. Squirtle is the moderate choice. He's for either for experienced players who don't want Charmander, beginner players who don't want Bulbasaur, or people who's skill is in between easy and experienced. Ice moves can also be taught to him, which can be an advantage.CHARMANDER: An exceptionally powerful fire Pokemon. He is not very good against the first gym leader, and terrible against the second. He seems to be the most popular choice, although he is the most difficult to train. He does become the best of the three in final form, because he obtains a secondary type of flying.From there, you must catch more Pokemon. You need a party of Pokemon (you can have up to 6) and you raise them, moving from town to town, gaining experience, fighting trainers, obtaining items, and catching new Pokemon. The other objective is to catch all the Pokemon (150 in Red &amp; Blue.) Some are easy to catch, some difficult, and some you must trade from Red. You see, the only diffrence between Red &amp; Blue is the distribution of Pokemon (11 diffrent in each version.) Some only in Red, some only in Blue. You must use a link cable between two versions. With the link cable, you can also battle the other person (but you won't gain experience.) That's a part of the game.I hope you found this helpful.

25,A21ZR0J50M644P,B00000IYEQ,Kathy L. Nomeland Ashley Grabowski,"[5, 5]","It's kind of strange how I manged to get into Pokemon, but here's how it all began: One day, during a Science class, a friend of mine and I were going around our elementary school yard and picking up trash and Tootsie Roll wrappers. The actual goal was as many Tootsie Roll wrappers we each got, that was how many Tootsie Rolls we would get. Anyway, I found a stray Ponyta Pokemon Card in one part of the yard, and my friend found a Dark Charmeleon. My friend said, I'll trade you my Dark Charmeleon for your Ponyta if you want. Well, personally, I didn't want to, I wanted to add this card and start a collection, but my friend's Dark Charmeleon did look sort of cool at the time. I finally gave in and said, well, why not? So we traded. A few days later, we started acting out some of the episodes at recess (I'd never seen the episodes at the time). My friend was basically making up his own little stories... never mind the episodes that were on TV. Later on, my liking for Pokemon grew when my friend decided to bring his Game Boy Color to school, AND his Pokemon Red Version. I thought to myself, hmmm... this could be interesting. I asked him what he was playing and if I could watch him play it. he said, sure you can watch. I didn't get to see much of the game because we weren't outside for recess that long. Then, I decided I wanted to get my own version of Pokemon Red. I asked my mom and she said I could. So I did. I got the game (almost 7 years later and I still haven't beaten it) and I ended up loving it. So, in conclusion, I'm eighteen and a half years old, a junior at Grafton High School, and I still love Pokemon (the games more than the episodes), but one thing has changed... my friend and I don't do reenactments of our favorite episodes anymore like we used to.

26,A2R4HK5ZJKL0UH,B00000IYEQ,Katie Dark Musashi,"[10, 11]","One word: PLAYBACK. My sister first owned this game in 1998, and since then I have owned MANY Pok&eacute;mon games for both Game Boy Color and N64. And let me tell you, the original is always the best! Pok&eacute;mon Red and Blue are the best games ever created for Game Boy Color! I still love these games, trading Pok&eacute;mon, and battling other people with the Link Cable!First of all, people of any age can enjoy this game. It is cute and innocent enough to entertain children, but the strategy and the level of gameplay make it a worthwhile game for adults. Everyone will love this game.You start out as a trainer named Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town. Your mission is to become a Pok&eacute;mon Master by catching 150 Pok&eacute;mon (151 if you count Mew) and becoming the champion of the Elite Four. To do this, you must train and catch Pok&eacute;mon, raise them, and even trade them between Red and Blue versions using your Link Cable or the infrared port on your Game Boy Color. This is both fun and time-consuming, which is great when you are at home sick or bored on a stormy day. Pok&eacute;mon are raised by winning battles and/or using Rare Candy. Raising Pok&eacute;mon may sound tedious, but you will change your mind about that when you actually play for yourself. Pok&eacute;mon is addictive from the moment you start your game all the way through. You will meet many new people on the way, become a hero, and win new items and abilities as you go along.As Ash, you travel through the world of Kanto, which is divided into a number of cities and towns. A map will be your guide as you make your way through the vast world of Pok&eacute;mon. Explore caves, oceans, tall grass, and rocky paths on your way. Each town or city usually has its own Pok&eacute;mon Gym, with a Gym Leader which is something like a Boss. Each time you beat a Gym Leader you receive a badge. You need eight badges to battle the Elite Four and the current Elite Four Champion. There are different diversions in each city and town, for example, Celadon City's department store and casino, and one of my personal favorites, Fuschia City's Safari Zone.Trainers can be found everywhere, good and bad, from Team Rocket invading the radio station, to the gyms, in the water, on the road, and pretty much anywhere you go. Random Pok&eacute;mon appear and battle you if you are in a cave, tall grass, or in the water. The wild Pok&eacute;mon you come across are the ones that you can catch if you have Pok&eacute;balls with you. Items such as the bike and repel can help prevent you from running into too many Pok&eacute;mon if you are trying to get somewhere. If your Pok&eacute;mon are tired or injured, you can stop at a Pok&eacute;mon center and heal them for free! You can also store Pok&eacute;mon via a computer terminal located within every Pok&eacute;mon Center.The music is so cute! And there is a lot of different music, so it doesn't get repetitive.If you are lucky enough to own Pok&eacute;mon Stadium, you can play Red or Blue on your TV screen using a Transfer Pak! You can also use the Pok&eacute;mon you raised on your Red or Blue game to battle in Pok&eacute;mon Stadium.Overall, this is one of the best games I have ever played. It is still fun after years of gameplay, as you never fully run out of stuff to do. If you want to get into Pok&eacute;mon, or if you're an old fan that never quite got around to getting the game, this is the game for you!

This allows kids to work at the tasks without getting frustrated.The idea is to start at Prof. Oak's house, get your first Pokemon from him, and then journey all around the land of Pokemon, collecting various wild pokemon (which you catch by battling them until they faint), and doing battle with other trainers along the way.In the process, kids learn to manuever through mazes of increasing complexity (which is why the manuals are a help), to gather and use items, and to develop strategies for fighting various types of Pokemon. My five year-old even started to read while using her Gameboy, from needing to know which items she had with her (in her Item List)!All in all these are great games which can be played over and over (although only one game at a time can be saved), and which will provide your kids with hundreds of hours of fun.",5,"A great game for kids, beats having them watch tv!",958953600,"05 22, 2000",0.2754

You start out as a young boy living with your mother, and set out to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer. When you try to leave town, Professer Oak will give you a starter Pokemon (the only real difference between this one and Yellow is that in Yellow, you MUST start with Pikachu).

Many puzzles, and 15 element types of Pokemon. Certain types are stronger against others, while each type has its weaknesses, too. There are a total of 150 Pokemon to be caught. However, some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue. You must link to the Blue version to catch all 150! (To make this easier, some people buy a Red AND Blue AND a Game Link Cable so they could complete the game on their own).Overall, this game is surprisingly fun and amusing, and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG (role-playing game) lovers.

I was not regretting it when I asked for it and got it for Christmas, because this game was so cool at first. On Christmas day of 1998, I must have played this game all day. In three days, I had all eight badges, and enough to take on the Elite Four. It took me a little while to beat them, I did. And that's when I got sick of the game. The thing is, after you beat the Elite Four, what you have is a group of superpowerful Pokemon that can only fight wild Pokemon, and you need to catch the rest of the Pokemon. The game becomes a big nothing. It's fun to raise low level Pokemon if you still have trainers you haven't fought, but besides that, it's a pretty big nothing. All you can really do is fight wild Pokemon, walk around, get lost(Which is hard because the game's map is too easy to figure out), and go shopping for items you probably won't need. I have never gotten all 151 Pokemon, because it gets so boring at around 120 that I can't stand it. The game is fun if you use cheats like starting off with Mew and multiplying items, but besides that, it's pretty boring. I'd say to buy it, but the fad is over now, and nobody cares. Playing Pokemon these days makes you an outcast. Only buy this if you're not afraid of ruining whatever reputation you have.PS: Don't say my review was helpful just because you're an angry fan.

From the perspective of a hard-core, long-time gamer it's heartening to know that something as popular as this does not require a monster PC with a Voodoo5 (indeed, it could easily be converted for the Commodore 64), and the never-ending, open-ended gameplay is a nice homage to 'Elite'.

36,A29L2RN5D8C0HM,B00000IYEQ,Prism Light Prism,"[5, 5]","In this game, you play as a boy collecting and battling creatures called Pok'emon. There are plenty of worlds to explore, Pok'emon to catch, rivals to battle, badges to earn, and items to find to keep you playing for a long time. It's one of those games that you can't beat in a day. Training Pok'emon can be fun, and also hard, depending on the level of your opponents. You earn money each time you beat another Pok'emon trainer, which you can use to buy items to strengthen or catch Pok'emon. The moves you teach your Pok'emon and what attacks you use require strategy, so it's not just random moves and thoughts.My only complaint is that this game is almost unbeatable. To win, you have to collect all the Pok'emon in the game, which is just a few tens short of 200, if I remember correctly. A bunch of things are required to do this. You must have two Game Boys and two Pok'emon games, or a friend who also has a Game Boy and Pok'emon game to trade with each other, because there are some points in the game where you must choose between one Pok'emon or another, and whichever one you don't choose is impossible to get again in the same game. Also required is a Game Boy link cable, which you need to attach two Game Boys to trade.So basically, it's going to be very, very, very hard to win, especially because everyone is past the Pok'emon phase. So unless you have multiple Game Boys and Pok'emon games, and a link cable, you're going to have tons of trouble beating the game. I think the people who made this game purposely made the game this way so that kids would have to spend more money on Game Boy supplies.Overall, I still like this game. I know I'll never beat it, but it's still a lot of fun. I can't say who I would and wouldn't recommend this game to, so I'll leave it up to you.

43,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00000IYEQ,S. Rhodes,"[121, 128]","The year was 1998. I was twelve years old, in middle school, and the Pokemon games debuted in the United States for the very first time. A game so simple and yet at the very same time: So complex. Nothing was more addictive, nothing was more fun than playing Pokemon. If you remember the craze (the REAL craze, presently it isn't nearly as strong as it was back then), then you remember what it was like to go to school back in those days. Suddenly EVERYONE had a Gameboy. Suddenly even those who didn't normally play games or even know what the hell a Gameboy was, had it. And you'd go up to your friends and you'd trade Pokemon, you'd taunt each other about who was the better champion when you battled. You got in arguments over who the best starter was. Then you learned of those glitches to get all your Pokemon to level 100 by duplicating the Rare Candies. You caught Missingno and M-Block and caught Safari Zone Pokemon by exploiting what may very well be one of the most widely known glitches in video game history. And of course, you went to catch them all, and you probably had that ONE friend who you deemed your rival and you had to catch 'em all before he did. If you remember all this, you're a true Pokemon fan. This isn't a myth, this game debuted, sold gazillions of copies and started a craze that--while it isn't as strong--still exists today. This was one of the heights of gaming period.The Red and Blue versions may have seen stateside release in 1998, but the game was actually made in 1995. Before the television show came around. When the TV series took off in America, the games came next and as I said, they sold more copies than the latest installment of Harry Potter. I'm not kidding.Red and Blue began almost everything you currently see in the series today. The game begins with you naming your character (you couldn't choose between a boy or a girl in this one) and then your rival. Again, if you had Pokemon fever you probably named your main character Ash and your rival was named Gary (even the strategy guides referred to them as such). It began with Professor Oak letting you have a Pokemon of your choice (between 3 starters) and then ultimately he'd send you on a journey with a Pokedex and have you document the Pokemon you'd find. Along the way, you'd have to deal with Team Rocket, the bad guys who are always causing trouble and stealing everyone's Pokemon, as well as gather eight badges so you could challenge the Elite Four and become a Pokemon League Champion. The entire formula began here, and just about everything mentioned above has been done in each and every main series Pokemon game hereafter.What was perhaps the strangest thing about Pokemon is that the game was surprisingly deep in terms of combat. It was your traditional turn-based combat. Simple, yet it was so complex. For one, the game has a Rock/Paper/Scissors method to it. Every Pokemon has a type, and every type has its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, Water is strong up against fire but it is weak vs. Grass. Grass is weak vs. fire etc. etc. No Pokemon is invincible. They all have a weakness to some type. Though in these versions the psychics definitely have an unfair advantage as the type they're weak against (bug) is almost non-existent and there are hardly any bug type attacks.In the battle menu you're given a list of commands. Fight, Item, PKMN, or Run. You can switch Pokemon you've caught in and out of battle on the fly, but it'll usually cost you a turn. It's the strategic portion of Pokemon that makes battling fun and addictive. As you go through the game you'll be challenged by trainers and you never know what they'll throw at you! It's completely unpredictable and some of them are tough. It's also interesting because with 150 different Pokemon, the amount of teams you can make are endless, and it really makes you think about what types you want in your roster. Because most of the Pokemon types are weak vs. more than just one type. It's also important that you give them a variety of moves, as the moves are also typed. On paper it doesn't seem like much, but when you actually play the game, you'll find a clog in your drain you didn't even know you had because you thought your team was perfect... but then that one Pokemon comes along and exposes your fatal flaw.Pokemon was no short game. It was full of all sorts of side quests. From the Safari Zone, to catching the Legendary Birds, to the Unknown Dungeon. There was plenty to do, and even after the game was over there was STILL more to accomplish. Of course, your main accomplishment was getting them all. Pokemon could easily keep you busy for well over 60 hours. In 1998 this is an amazing feat seeing as how most RPGs of TODAY don't keep you busy that long. The main quest itself only took a measly 15 hours or so, but all the extra content kept you on your toes.Even more, Pokemon was one of the few Gameboy Games that made excellent use of the link cable. Since Red and Blue versions had different Pokemon, some only appeared in certain versions. You couldn't for example, catch a Magmar in the Red version, but you could in Blue. How then, were Red players supposed to catch all 150? By trading. Until Pokemon came around, my link cable was collecting dust. Trading was usually a slow grueling process, though. Traded Pokemon also got an experience boost so they were easier to train.Even more exciting than trading, however, was what really made Pokemon a blast to play: Battling. You and your friends could get together and battle one another! Test out your Pokemon teams against your friends. They were, more often not, far better to battle against than the games trainers. It's always interesting to see who your opponents heavy hitter is. With your friends it was always interesting. Imagine how embarrassed you were to say a certain Pokemon sucked only to discover that the trainer actually did a good job training?As far as the game looks and sounds, it didn't really look all that great when it was released in 1998 (it was after all, a game made in 1995). On the original gameboy it was pretty grainy (but very clear on the Gameboy Pocket) and of course it was black or white (unless you played it on a Super Gameboy or Gameboy Color). For a Gameboy game, though, it actually wasn't too bad. It was annoying to watch a Pokemon simply flinch to attack, and some of the animations weren't all that great, but it was to be expected due to the Gameboy's limitations. The music, however, was fantastic. The tunes were catchy--particularly the trainer battles and gym leader battles. The only really annoying thing was the sound effects. They weren't all that great, and its a shame that Nintendo actually continues to use those exact same sound effects in Pokemon games today. Still, for what it's worth, this was the game you wanted on the Gameboy.Pokemon is a classic. It'll always be a classic. No matter who you are, if you played Pokemon ten years ago, the craze was completely undeniable. If you got addicted like I did, chances are you're still playing today. Because in its core, the game was far deeper than you thought it was, and the series continues to use that same basic formula even today.",5,This is Where It All Began,1177977600,"05 1, 2007",0.0467

The choices are Charmander, a fire type;squirtle, a water type;or bulbasaur, a fire type. Interestingly, three Pokemon you choose from are like rock/paper/scissors, charmander beats bulbasaur, squirtle beats charmander, and bulbasaur beats squirtle. Soon, you rival chooses his Pokemon(annoyingly, its always the one that has the type advantage, like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander. You are then given the task of completing a complete guide of Pokemon by catching all of them. In order to beat the game, you only need the first 150 Pokemon, however, there is also a legendary number 151 Mew. You catch Pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it, then catching it with a Pokeball. Once you catch a Pokemon, you may use it to fight others, but you can only have up to 6 Pokemon at a time. Along the way, you will encounter other trainers you may battle. There are regular trainers, which you battle only for money, fun, and experience. However, there are also gym leaders, which are specialized trainers with stronger Pokemon than regular trainers in their area have. There are 8 in all, and once you beat them, you may then battle the elite four, who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession. You also encounter your rival throughout the game. And he becomes Pokemon League Champion, however, once you defeat him, you become Pokemon League Champion. There are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well. Their boss is also the leader of gym 8. I have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what you're doing, however, the elite 4 is very tough, especially since you have to face them all toghether. There are also legendary Pokemon, which are considered to be part of the 151 total, and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch. Also, one cool thing is there is a lot of moves(although some are kind of stupid) and certain Pokemon have strengths over others. For example, fire takes out grass easily. However, you can beat the game just by having stronger Pokemon, however, this is actually harder than using strategy. Because it takes a great length of time to level up, while a skilled player can quickly catch a Pokemon with a type advantage. And to the guy who said he beat this game in a hour....if you think this game is easy, than you should quit playing videogames altoghether, because you obviously are such a great master of everything. Also, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME IN A HOUR! AT MINIMUM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT FOR AT LEAST LIKE 20 HOURS FOR YOUR POKEMON TO BE HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TOO! Oh, wait, you must have used a gameshark. Wow, no wonder you are so good at videogames. But if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour, they either cheated, found a big glitch, or both. Or else their exaggerating. But the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide. Oh this game is so easy, I only had to read 50 books on it to beat it on the first try. GET REAL! IF THIS ISN'T A CHALLENGE, NOTHING IS! Overall, its a great game, but there are some annoying things. First off, to get all 151, you must trade with freinds, as neither red nor blue has every Pokemon, but they do combined. Most Pokemon are in both versions, but some are exclusive to either red or blue. Also, as you level up your Pokemon, they evolve(which is really more accurately described as metamorphises), and some only evolve by trading them with the same Pokemon with another player. Another thing is there is only one save slot. Finally, in the Japenese version, by getting the first 150, you get number 151,but in the US version you can only get them through Nintendo's promotions or by cheating. Hmm, giving Americans a raw deal, aye Nintendo? You know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games. In Japan, gamers would be outraged, but you know you can take advantage of us Americans? Okay, go ahead. But despite the fact that it isn't as good as the Japenese version or a perfect game, Pokemon Red is still one of my favorites.",4,CHARIZARD GO!,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",0.147
