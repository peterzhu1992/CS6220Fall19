0,A1IAQOSPATLKWO,B00000J2OO,Ben Lehbert,"[0, 0]",This was a great buy for the N64. I was inspired to buy this game after seeing the movie scene with the Podracing. So all an all you start off as a noob and work your way to the top buying parts for your pod. You can choose from many racers. I give this game the rating that it got for its fun with some frustrating races.,4,Good buy,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",0.2749

This is a must have racing game.If you liked this game then check out all of the other star wars games.,5,May The Force Race With you,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",0.414
2,AS09CJ2GLNXNV,B00000J2OO,D.N.,"[1, 1]","Well, I love moving this fast in a vgame. I enjoyed playing in the Tatooine course, and the made-up levels actually seem like real STAR WARS designs, unlike Rogue Squadron 2. Often you're racing through a level, and you kind of want to stop playing....but you don't, because you want to make the next turn, or just love peacefully gliding over the land at that speed. I never got into tuning up the racers, maybe there's something lacking there. You aren't often right beside the other pod, it would have been nice to implement an element of slamming into the other pod to have a fun/dangerous fight while performing the race, if that option were here and was fun, it would provide an all-new level of depth/excitement to the game, maybe if you had to avoid Subulba like the film. I thought I heard there will be a sequel to this game, hopefully they will optimize it for the next-gen systems like Xbox, because they didn't when this was merely ported to Sega Dreamcast. A sequel would make a cool online game, but make they could introduce AOTC areas or make a 3-4 more Tatooine levels. The graphics here are very smudgey, I would advise getting the PC or DC version or something, but it's worth getting as it is so [inexpensive] now.",4,"What is fun about it, what is not.... make a SEQUEL!",1038355200,"11 27, 2002",0.4601
3,A1ZTHW8CSTPZQD,B00000J2OO,Erica .D,"[0, 0]",I am not much of a star wars fan but this game is fun. I found it for $3 at a used game store. It was worth it. Its actually more fun when playing multiplayer and with the steering wheel. I also enjoyed the star wars game shadow of the empire.,4,Pretty good!,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",0.2843
4,A308CPZVR00BTN,B00000J2OO,Evan M.,"[0, 0]","Of course anyone who owns an N64 wants an epic Star Wars game mixed with the sheer speed of Mario Kart, and this game is the baby from both Lucasarts and Nintendo's endeavors. With the Expansion Pak, Graphics look well rounded and nice to look at, and the track selections throughout the game bring that nostalgic feeling back into the air as you relive your fantasy of being a space cowboy wielding a lightsaber. Perfect for any hardcore race fan or Star Wars geek!",5,Expansion Pak does wonders,1368576000,"05 15, 2013",0.1089
5,A2C66ZWC2V5FES,B00000J2OO,Grace G,"[0, 0]","You need the expansion pack-- which isn't that expensive nowadays. If you love racing games than this game is for you. This game is fun and challenging. You go around racing in different planets. Plus you can upgrade your vehicle. For the N64 the graphics are pretty good. You can't really compare it with the newer games. Like I said before, some tracks are really easy while others.. HA.. are hard. I mean really hard.This game is perfect for killing time.",5,Time Killer,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",0.2703
6,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B00000J2OO,Jeff Johnson Jeff Johnson,"[1, 1]","I am no fan of star wars, however, this is a really great game that has gotten a bad rap, because it came with N64 systems. First off the graphics cannot be beaten, everything is extremely detailed from the textures to the fact that every part of the pod racers moves and shutters. This game offers more than one dozen pod racers and drivers, each is unique with unique speeds, skills, traction breaks and so on, each pod racer must be earned though by coming in first for the race where the pod racer is featured. Along the way you pick up cash from bets that you come in first, second or third, then you use this cash to buy better parts to your pod racer and pit droids to quickly repair your racer. This is a highly imaginative game complete with three major circuits and a special circuit, in terms of the courses themselves I am a fan of racing games and nothing has ever gotten this amazing, jumps that will take your breath away, ice caverns that try to trick you, anti gravity tubes that will let you fly, swamps that will boggle your mind and speeds to boggle your mind too. The difficulty in the races range from circular to near impossible, with eruptions of fire and snipers shooting at you from high above. For Amazon's price, you need to get this game!",5,"Best courses for a racing game, original and imaginative",1001980800,"10 2, 2001",0.0576

However, as a racing game, I enjoyed this immensely.Here is the flipside. This game is not NEAR as good as, say Hydro Thunder, or Need for Speed. The best thing about this game is the multiplayer, as the single player gets old fast.My reccomendation, find a friend, rent the game, and have fun!",4,"Good Game, Not The Best",1137628800,"01 19, 2006",0.2984

Bragging lies from the pointless haters group that are just in it for the spotlight.

12,A2QFSG4YQIKU1T,B00000J2OO,wellmlynn,"[2, 2]","Star Wars Episode 1 Racer. Well, in this game you play as one of many characters that can be unlocked by winning races and setting records. After each race, if you place high enough, you can upgrade your podracer by buying new parts, or searching through Watto's Junkyard. There is a multiplayer, but it is pretty standard, just a split screen racing option. This is a pretty good game, and ... it's a great buy. I commend Lucasartss for the feeling of really fast racing, but besides this and the ability to buy parts, this game is essentially nascar on different planets with space ships and a winner title.",3,This is a pretty good racing game,966816000,"08 21, 2000",0.4402
