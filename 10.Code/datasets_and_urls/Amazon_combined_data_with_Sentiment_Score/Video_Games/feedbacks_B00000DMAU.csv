1,ACSZTM3KHFPBL,B00000DMAU,Andy Griffith Bloodrayne,"[0, 0]","This is, by far, undeniably the racing game to have.A game with over 20 cars to choose from? UNHEARD OF at the time- this game's got over 150, folks.A game with true-to-life car physics, sounds, and handling? GET REAL, right? Nope, all here.A game with so much customization, import tuner companies piss their pants? It's ALL here.Gran Turismo is the original racing simulator that started it all.You start off with a measly 10,000 bucks. That all but gets you a clunker of a car, which, after beating a bunch of driver's ed tests, you can use to sneak your way through a few races....winning a bit of cash and some cars you can either sell or save to tune later....until you can finally buy your dream car (which for me was the Acura NSX Type S-Zero the first time I played through it)Let me just stress how perfect this game is....Sure, your first time through it, you'll take a hairpin turn at Grand Valley way too fast, spin out of control, scream, yell, and curse at the TV, maybe throw and break your controller as you finish in last place....but over time, you'll feel so much utter control of your car, that any shimmy or shake the car makes while cornering or countersteering or powersliding, you'll know exactly how to correct it. No two cars in the game handle the same. You have your FF, FR, MR, and 4WD drivetrains.Simply, you have it all here.The graphics in the game push the Playstation to the limit....this, GT2, and R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 are by far the best-looking racing games on the original Playstation.There are hordes of races to race, and multiple cars to win, so the replay value is through the roof.My absolute FAVORITE part about the game is fine-tuning the gear ratios of a fully-tuned, supercharged turbo monster of a car, and trying to get every last ounce of power out of it for a top speed at the Test Track. I've literally spent days at a time fiddling with the gear ratios on a car, knowing that someway, somehow, I'd be able to squeeze another 2 or 3 MPH out of it. Not only that....adjusting the car's ride height affects top speed and acceleration, too....My personal best was achieving 274 MPH with the Mitsubishi GTO Twin Turbo MR....It took me at least 8 hours to get it from its standard 252 MPH top speed it gets with all of the top performance parts, and no fiddling with gear ratios or anything....The one, and ONLY downside to the game is that you only get $12,000 for any car you sell that you won from a tournament. Even a car that you KNOW should rake in WAY more than just 12K....like say for instance, the TVR Cerbera LM.Other than that, this game is absolute perfection, 10 out of 10....",5,Heaven on wheels!,1107302400,"02 2, 2005",0.1987
2,A1BFP8YENGNN2H,B00000DMAU,Becky B,"[0, 0]","I was looking for a racing video game for my new playstation, and everyone I talked to told me to get Gran Turismo. And now I know why. It's so fun! It's challenging, but not impossible. The graphics are good and realistic, and there are tons of cars to choose from. I really like the simulation mode where you can race for money and buy new cars or upgrade old ones. I'm a huge fan of my Dodge Viper with racing stripes.One thing that's not so great about this game is the space that it takes up on your memory card. Just to have a simulation mode game going, you need 5 empty blocks. If you want to get into saving replays and stuff, it can use up to 15 blocks. Memory cards are expensive... I'm not willing to devote an entire memory card to one game, no matter how great it is.",5,A racing classic!,1008633600,"12 18, 2001",0.1181

5,A37DLVPKJZGSQF,B00000DMAU,Hannibal,"[2, 3]","Graphics: 8/10 - You can see some of the computerised effects you crash or something, but all of the graphics in this game look good and give feel to the competition.Sound: 8/10 - There could be a bit more commotion when you crash or flip or something, but the engines vrooming gives you a thrill and the creaking sound of the breaks is eye-widening.Value: 10/10 -This game is seriously worth the money. The word value is essential when buying a game and you get your money's worth and more. In short: get it now!Overall: 9/10 - Fabulously entertaining and complex car game that really lives up to its reputation.

Watch out for copies that don't read Greatest hits on. Seems there was a bug that wouldn't allow you to get 100% in the game.

7,A1DUWRMZVLRKAJ,B00000DMAU,maskedgamer,"[0, 0]","When this game came out I was a pimply faced highschool kid. All I wanted was a car heck even a drivers license would do. The closest thing I could get to driving a real car was playing games like well... playing games like.... ummm? well... THERE WERE NO GAMES EVEN CLOSE TO DRIVING A REAL CAR!Then one day at funcoland I picked up a magazine and read about this new game comming out called Gran Turismo, and how it was the ultimate car game. They used real cars and physics to make the game that much authentic. It was the closest a pimply faced highschool kids dream come true. This wasn't just another mash the gas driving game... this was a revolutionary driving experience.I slapped my 20 bucks down on a preorder that day. When Gran Turismo was realised... it changed all driving games as you know it. All I remember was this being the first driving game that took cars seriously, and I don't know about you, but the first time I loaded in that Disk, and saw all those car names flashing across the screen I almost wet my pants in exctasy. This was the driving game I had been waiting for my entire life!Never had there been so much detailed paid to a vehicle in a game. I mean everysingle aspect was there,even a car wash! I have no idea how many hours I spent playing that game, but took up heaps of my time afterschool. The game was an instant legend, and if you didn't own it, didn't play it, or didn't know someone who had or did, you might as well as hung yourself with your Sega Saturn power chord. The game was just that good.Even to this day I don't think anything has quite impacted or revolutionized racing games...other than the idea of online game play. But, this was the game that gave birth to it all. Sure over the years there have been many platform editions of the game, but there is only one true gran turismo, and that's the original. If your looking for this game today, its because you want to add it to your ps1 collection, and this is a game well worth having if you missed out on it. As for me, I have my memory cards sitting in the garage, just incase someone wants to Challenge my Dodge Viper GTS-R one day.",5,This game changed my life!,1245801600,"06 24, 2009",0.1348
8,APS7IH14C8AZ9,B00000DMAU,M. King The super mario nerd,"[0, 0]","This is the very first gran turismo game made. It is very fun and allot easier than the others. There r so many different cars in this game, not even close to the amount as the newer ones but it has allot for the first game. The graphics r good for the ps1 but i have seen better. The cars slow down every time they hit a wall so that is one thing i hate and most of the tracks r only ment for a couple racers not six or more. That makes the track very hard to race on. In the quick race it lets u get better but it only has about twenty cars and ten tracks but it is fun if u play it on multiplayer. That is the reason that i like this game so much, it has a great multiplayer. It does get boring after awhile but it is a fun game.",4,Fun game.,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",0.3236

But one day my older brother, went to a videogame store planning to by the 64 with Mario. I had already sold my SNES, and i was just waiting to begin collecting stars. Then when my bro came by, He was carrying a bag with a Playstation Box and a rare game called Gran Turismo.I was really mad, until he connected it, and when the Sony logo appeard, I was shocked, sound, graphics etc, from the video of Gran Turismo the presentation, to my first race, that was it, I forgot everything about nintendo, except of Killer Instinct, but thats how it started.The other Gran Turismos are obviolusly better, but this is the one that made the leap. like, MGS, FFVII, and all those awesome PS1 games that changed how we play right now. Gran Turismo is that kind of game that not everyone loves, specially the arcade ones, but its simply amazing. The best of its kind and time.By that time a NFS normaly had no more than 15 - 20 cars, and this changed it forever with more than 160 cars. If you want a realistic experience buy a PS3 and Gran Turismo 5, and after that you'll want to have the collection. I have passed the 5 of them, including the prologue, it takes time, but that why i am paying.Characteristics:+ 160 cars and customizable, first time in history11 detailed tracksreal PhisicsBest racing graphics until Gran Turismo 2 and so on.most realistic control until....GT2 and so on tooThe best quaility in menus, and a revolutionary simulation mode, also an arcade mode.First time ever replays and to save you replay too.Simply a classic.",5,The reason I left Nintendo,1225065600,"10 27, 2008",0.346
11,A1UBTX90IESSOO,B00000DMAU,The K Man TKM,"[1, 1]","I played this game for the first time some thirteen years ago and I was blown away. In the days of 32 bit graphics on PlayStation, this was as good as it was going to get for car games. While EA had the arcady Need For Speed franchise, Sony and Polyphony Digital's first foray into simulation racing was absolutely fantastic. As the first entrant into the series that is now up to GT5 (I don't care what the negative reviews say, that game is great!), this shines as the title that started it all. I won't go into the nuances of the game here because others have done so before me. If you are chronologically inclined like I tend to be, and you want to start the series at its genesis before moving on to the later games, there is no better place to start that right here at GT1. Be forewarned, of course, that the graphics on your HD TV will be a little lacking...ok, a lot lacking. With all the cars, setups, tracks, and races to make up for it, the now suspect graphics won't matter at all.

12,AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00000DMAU,TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore,"[1, 2]","Effortlessly dusting the competition, Gran Turismo flashes past the finish line with slick controls and stellar gameplay. It's easily the best of the PlayStation's realistic racing games.Starting off in the garage, Turismo scores big with 166 real-life cars, ranging from the lowly Honda Civic to the high-end dream machines like the Corvette, Viper, and Toyota Castrol Supra. The excellent selection of tracks delivers plenty of variety, and Turismo performs like a winner with no draw-in, speedy load times, and blazing-fast action. But gameplay is where Turismo really rocks. A fast, pick-up-and-play Arcade mode, along with topnotch two-player split-screen racing, positions Turismo at the head of the pack for casual racing fans. And hardcore racers who delve into the amazing Sim mode will uncover impressive depth. It's almost like fantasy league racing-you test for licenses, participate in a wide array of events, buy and maintain as many cars as you can afford, and even upgrade their performances with a vast multitude of parts.Need for Speed III may have more flash, but Turismo's got more game. It's one of the must-buy titles of this summer.",5,Pretty good,1057622400,"07 8, 2003",0.3536
