I found the ambience slightly disturbing, that's good. Fans of the films will appreciate all the locales being included. The graphics are extremely dated, but for fans of old school games who don't need extreme eye candy, this is a solid buy.",4,Solid fun,1044057600,"02 1, 2003",0.1777
1,AU54AUT75ZMST,B00000IKCC,Classic GameFan1991,"[1, 1]","This game had the potential to be great, but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with, as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game. If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games, or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations, than you just may be good to go, but you can easily take a lot of damage, and you can't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games, or Quake. If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you, then go ahead and play this, but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements, I think you are better off playing Doom 3, Silent Hill, the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3.These are my two cents.",2,Extremely Clunky Controls Ruin It,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",-0.5653
2,A10VEFED62UPM9,B00000IKCC,C. V. Orraca HWC1218,"[2, 3]","I bought this game back in December. I played it for about 2 solid hours. I come to realize that this is it. All the same levels are like this. So boring and so not like the movies, and the movement and the weapons in this game are terrible. Not to mention the animation of the Aliens, they look like they are break dancing or having an upright seizure, moving back and forth like a tiger pacing in a cage. The alien creatures are so predictable in this game, and not the least bit scary. The parasites things that crawl on the ceiling, walls, and floor is perfectly done, but I am going to have to say that even the DOOM games bring better action and better background and goals and weapon options compared to this Alien game. The PC game, ALIEN VS PREDATOR is by far way better than this, and is true to the plot and movie action.Its too bad I spend 12 dollars on this game, I am going to re-sell it right away and let some other sucker buy it.",2,"Not true to the movie at all, ALIEN INSURRECTION ARCADE 2006 is way Better!",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",0.0221
3,A3IIBE4D1VECWC,B00000IKCC,D. Allen,"[2, 2]","I remember playing this game back around 1996. I was nearly 12 years old when I first played this game and I thought, at the time, this was a really cool game. I really like the Alien movies (mainly the first and second one) and I was fairly excited to play any game based on my favorite movie.Now, as a grown up (or maybe still a child at heart, lol), I came across this game again. Remembering all my childhood experiences with this game, I was fairly excited to relive it. Right after playing it for about 5 minutes, I started laughing at myself. I honestly don't know what I saw in this game. The game is so horribly crafted that it's really a surprise that they released this game at all. The graphics are ok (given the time it was released), and the weapons are kinda cool. However, that's all that's good about this game.If you are buying this game to relive some childhood memories, I recommend not buying it because you're going to ruin some good memories. Just keep it as memories, don't relive it because you might see it differently.",2,Not good for bringing back old memories,1167523200,"12 31, 2006",0.3298

And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before. This game is like doom, you know the one where you just see the weapon. Dont' get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheat.",1,"A Very Boring game,",1138147200,"01 25, 2006",-0.3706
5,AUNRPDIOQ0XU1,B00000IKCC,Dom,"[0, 1]","The product arrived in its original case with game booklet. The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it. The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult. It takes some getting used to. The image was very dark, not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem. The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this. The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together. Overall i was not happy with the game itself. I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product.",1,"Boring game, not fun",1352073600,"11 5, 2012",-0.1009
6,A1EKA9XSI641C9,B00000IKCC,John S. Milas,"[0, 0]","KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!This game is old, and it shows. There is no Dual Shock capabilities, and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors. It really looks like it could be a cell phone game. The story is: there is no story. You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time, obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients. This game isn't very creative, or well designed, but it is classic. In the end, and as a fan of the Alien series, I must say DO NOT play this game. It will only alter your perception of the series.",2,Fans only!,1121472000,"07 16, 2005",0.0737
7,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00000IKCC,N. Durham Big Evil,"[9, 10]","Originally released way, way back a little after the release of the original Playstation; Acclaim's Alien Trilogy (you can tell this game is old considering the film series stopped being a trilogy when the fourth film Alien Resurrection was released a year later on) is a straight forward first person shooter in which you play as Ripley going through all the Xenomorph infested areas from the first three films. By today's standard's the graphics, gameplay, and weapon options are all pretty dated, but in it's day Alien Trilogy was one of the better FPS games to hit the PS1. All in all, if you still have your PS1 and dig older FPS games, you should give this one time gem a look.",4,Solid near classic PS1 fun,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",0.4087
8,A343CF9RXZ7DNG,B00000IKCC,Railgun,"[6, 6]","For those of us who got a PSX at rollout, Alien Trilogy deffinately belongs in the list of all time PSX classic games. Sure, by today's graphics standards it's not so great but it has great game play. The best thing about this game is the ambiance - dark, great music, it is a little scarry. The game is simple to play and control. Yes, the Doom/Unreal crowd won't like it - not enough buttons and weapons of mass destruction. No, this is the first person shooter your girlfriend will want to play too. Acclaim should remake this title for PS2 with more CG story cuts and cohesive plot.",4,Ditto: PSX Classic,1001376000,"09 25, 2001",0.1934
