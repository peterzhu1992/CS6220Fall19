But the acting is no worse than the movie so I give it one extra star because you can do stuff, not just sit there and watch the lousey acting. &quot;Qui gon, I have a bad feeling about dis&quot; Well, it's kinda fun, I guess. You get to whack things with yer light-saber which sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience are excellent in my opinion. Music even better. Gameplay OK. Graphics are not the best for now but very good for 1999. You want a good Episode I game, try Racer.",2,fair-de-middle-in,966297600,"08 15, 2000",0.4196
1,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B00000IZ7Q,Brian A. Wolters,"[4, 4]","The Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film. It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view (a la Tomb Raider.) There are many puzzles within the actions scenes. Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete. The hardest of which is when you first meet &quot;the mysterious little boy.&quot; There isn't much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than 3rd. Some of the camera angles are weird. Other than that, this is a very solid effort.",4,A Very Solid Game,975196800,"11 26, 2000",0.0321

4,A26W3W579V3NJO,B00000IZ7Q,Mike,"[1, 1]","This is a very good game in a way that when you has seen the film you just have to get as the play is just so like the film. The game play is very like the film in many ways as if you split up the film in to sections then this game has a level in each piece of the film. You can even follow the story while playing it. So you don't have to have seen the film to appreciate this game but it will help as you will know what is happening throughout. It is quite a hard game to get used to but once you do, it becomes really good from there on and you can't get off of it as it is very addictive as you want to get to the next section of the film. The good thing is that it is not only just an action game like you would think but also very much a strategy one having to figure out where to go next. And to top it off you even play as queen amidala in one level! If you love the film like i do then you will love this!!",4,Very very good!!,987811200,"04 21, 2001",0.5376
5,AEB45TKHZI37F,B00000IZ7Q,Nathan,"[35, 42]","The Phantom Menace. Sometimes this game seems like an excellent one, while at others it is downright boring and silly.The graphics, while not the best, are certainly the best i'll ever see on my fast-approaching obsolete computer. They are still pretty impressive though, as are the reflections, particle trails, and other little graphical effects. The sounds and voices are all pretty good too.While the first few levels and the last few levels are pretty much fun, the Tatooine levels are boring and silly. Also, after playing the jedi for half of the game, you feel immeasurably weak when you are forced to play as panaka or the queen with her wimpy &quot;droid stunner&quot; gun.The first time you play this game, it is pretty fun and challenging. Most of the puzzles aren't too difficult, but then you get to those jumping puzzles like the one on level three, and due to the awkward POV and controls, it takes twenty minutes to cross that little bit of water. This becomes a constant problem later...little jumping puzzles that take a vast amount of time and get very annoying very fast. It's also annoying running around tatooine, running when people try to kill you but not allowed to kill them, and trying to trade things back and forth.Fortunately, the darth maul fights are pretty cool.The second time you play the game, it's extremely easy, and I don't think I died once, and I beat the game in one sitting. Boring, fast, this game is fun the first time but has no replayability value. Add to that the lack of variety in enemies (100's of battle droids with once and a while a destroyer thrown in), and the lack of multiplayer, and you get a game which is decent but not worth the original $50 price.Now that the price has gone down, if you like these types of games, I'd recommend trying it, but if you prefer shoot-em-up action games, stear clear of this one.",3,An OK game,952473600,"03 8, 2000",0.2734
6,A2ZESFCRJL7YA0,B00000IZ7Q,N. Wagstaff,"[0, 3]","This game is super hard the first time around. Then, when you beat it, and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour, because almost all of it is puzzles, so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights, where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest, funnest fight is in the very beggining, when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units, and better levels, this game would be worth buying, but as it is it is not all that good.",3,"Hard, but not fun",970963200,"10 8, 2000",0.0214
