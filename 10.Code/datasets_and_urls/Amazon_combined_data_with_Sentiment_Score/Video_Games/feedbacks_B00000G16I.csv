Even on a speedy top-end machine the screen will fill with portions of white if you try to scroll at one of higher resolutions. Perhaps this is also SC3K's main virtue - the fact that you can see down to the last person in your metropolis. Whatever you say, despite the game's vast graphical and not-so-vast strategic advances, it failed to do what the fans of the series held closest to their hearts - personalization. The city develops completely at random within your zonal confines - you cannot make a candleshop district, a Downtown, or anything of the sort. You cannot name streets, despite the fact that you place them yourself. The papers mention you rarely and glancingly, at best, preferring to metion senseless rock bands (whose names you cannot supply either) or some other uneventful thing. The advisors are as helpful as ever - specifically, useless. They either take no notice of the trouble befalling your city, or they take notice of something very minor and blow it up to the size of a scandal. THE 1% COMMERCIAL TAX IS KILLING THE CITY! REMOVE THE PARKING FINES! All the while industry fails to develop and a major power outage goes unnoticed.This game is a cleaner, crisper version of SimCity 2000, perhaps an update, but in no way a new game in the series.",4,Spawling,950054400,"02 9, 2000",-0.1586

Unfortunately as the cities increase in population, so does the chances of the computer crashing - a very annoying problem. Also the parades last too long, the seaports are difficult to develop, the terrain for some cities, such as St. Louis, are unusually hilly, and the buildings look alike. The game is not that challenging. But overall a recommended game.",4,Can be addictive,1006128000,"11 19, 2001",-0.03

Then, after about two hours of gameplay, MY 855,500 pop. city had a problem with people. It must have, because in less than 20 minuets, My city was reduced to about 250,000 pop. Get this IT WAS FOR NO APPARENT REASON. My popularity was high, all of the ordenances I could have had were activated, all buildings had water and power, I had full funding to schools, firestations, police, ect., police and fire coverage were excelant, taxes were only at 3 for everything (Ind., Com., and Res.), and everything else you could think of, I had it. It was the perfect city and my whole population (who still liked by the way) left the city. If you have a good reason for it , I'd say it was a glitch in the game. Don't get me wrong, it is a fun game when there is a reason to the sudden drops, but I don't think you can have a real good city that lasts for more than four or five hours and there is no good city, they'll all die out eventually. The only option you have is LOSS. I am hoping that SC 4000 will be MUCH better.",2,People start leaving for no reason,1024099200,"06 15, 2002",0.0845

I can never get any profit at the end of each year. Sure, I can use the $100,000 cheat code, but it only works once. Another problem is getting the people to work. Even if you put residential areas (where they live) next to industrial areas (where they work), they still might complain that it is too far to go. Some good things about Sim City 3000 is that you can build famous landscapes. Also, the graphics are great!

6,AH4FPPM86UHKG,B00000G16I,Ethan,"[2, 3]","Making a City, it's a change for once. I like this game because it gives easy control, and it's fun to play. There are some down-sides to it too, like it takes too long to make a big city, and Sims complain tooooo much, but it's all good other then that. My favorite thing to do is save the city, then rip it down by disteasters. The good thing is you don't have to save it after you destory it. This game can be easy or hard, like if you want to make a big city, it takes time, and it's hard, but if you use codes like:I am weak, Call coison Vinnie, I love Red Tape, Power to the masses, Water in the desert, Garage in garage out, and nardz rool(actually spelling) it's eazy (...).

I'm more of an action person, not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person. Sure, Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it's catchy graphics and innovative approach to buidling a city, but a few hours later, you'll either want to fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor, depending upon whether the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year. I turned out to be one of the latter people. No matter how hard I tried, I could never get the income to come out positive. So, I did what any distraught and stuck person would do...go online for cheat codes! An hour later, I was bored. If you're a thinker, by all means try Simcity 3000 out. But, if you're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words, try Dungeon Keeper 2, a game like Simcity 3000, but not as complex (and more active!).",1,YAWN....,954115200,"03 27, 2000",0.1034
8,A3SGRYIICHGMX,B00000G16I,Jack Turner,"[1, 1]","While the game itself is quite good. I enjoy playing my copy of the game, and still find new interest and challenges of running cities. The replay value should be obvious as there is no &quot;end goal&quot; to meet, though there are &quot;rewards&quot; along the way. There are several problems, however, particularly when compared to Sim City 2000. First, there are no scenarios. That is a pity because the scenarios often enhanced the value of the game. Second, you cannot for your own landform in the New City mode before you start the game (again, unlike SC2000). Both of these problems were later corrected for the later cousin of the game: Sim City 3000 Unlimited. Additionally, the online support is much better for Unlimited. The building downloads on the official website are minimal, and the building design tool is not supported by the basic game. Still, I will have to admit that 3000 is still a vast improvement over the previous version. The buildings are better designed, and they really do look different on different sides. Also, the graphics are much better over 2000, while they are not vastly improved in Unlimited (which is essentially the same game, with the additions above AND additional buildings). I would recommend that you do buy Unlimited over this version simply because of the vast number of updates. And, with the release of Sim City 4, it is highly unlikely that even the Unlimited website will stay up much into the future, and it certainly will not be supported any more.",3,Not Well Supported,1051142400,"04 24, 2003",0.1595

Becuase it just isn' that good of a game, I'm an expert ing gaming and pcs and have been in the business since windows 95. But this game is made for the average dumb american, that is why it is so simple, and lacks any depth. This game is perfect for teenagers, soccer moms, and stud people, but anybody who likes a good challenging game shouldn't even look in it's direction.These are the good things about the game....1. It has playability value but not much, from 1 to 10 maybe a 3, becuase once you master it( spoiler, it takes about a hundred years to get a size million in a city) you just don't give a damn about playing it again.2. System requirements are low, and it runs on the most ancient pc that is feasible.3. It's easy to learn to play, and inexpensive, and the graphics are pretty good for those who care unless you get to close( highest zoom).4. You can voyage out of reality and build a city of imagination.Now these are the concerns about the game.1. The game has very little realistic qualities about it, it is not in check with the real word, even the information bar suggest it was mad for kids.2. There is no names for streets, no district and area setting, and no combining indidvidual parks to make one small, medium or large park( Different small or large parks placed to getting but functioning different ans seperate is not realistic).3. There are not as many tax forms as they are in the real world, and the maps are either way too small or only show the central part of the city, which is also unrealistc, since all large cities have metros.4. The max loan size is way too small, and the interest is a bit extreme.5. The airports don't generate as much income as they should.6. There are not nearly enough mass transit options in the game, and the availabe ones are very unrealistic. The train option is just horrific, and the subway us expensive and not very fun to build,( they were probably thinking that the game is about cit building, but transportation is a huge part of any city over 300,000) the highways are basicly useless and very expensive and difficult to build, and there are no underground building and other types of roads and highways, and no street lights and signs.7. It is just about impossible to get a city size of over 4 million even on the larget plot availabe, and even when thinking this is just the central part of a city and the metro is not shown on map is still not feasible, since the large us cities have far more than 5million people in there central part.8. The game crashes and is racked with bugs.all in all you see why this game gets a 40, if less, this game is not just that great, hopefully they will fix atleast 60 percent of these major flaws(anything less is unacceptable) in the next simcity, and as for simcity 4, lets not just go there,and there will not be a five, ( I believe maxis is not in operation anymore and has just not announced it), but the city simulation industry is still wide open and the demand is high.",3,Decent at best,1245456000,"06 20, 2009",0.0461

The game starts out in pause mode. This gives you time to zone space for roads, residental &amp; commercial or indutry zones, water pipes and electrical wires. It times take to know the best way to zone RCIs. It's not easy and money can disappear fast so don't go crazy zoning everything and destorying things, it will cost you.

12,A2NU3IJYTDIPCI,B00000G16I,S. Breazeal,"[13, 16]","First off, let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazon.com:*Realistic 3-D environmentWrong. The game is 2D, it merely looks 3D. It IS realistic, however. There is far more detail in 2D than could ever have been done in 3D and still hae it run on everyone's machine.*View cities from up to 50,000 feetI guess...you have 5 zoom levels. The above implies that you can zoom to any level.*Detailed control over businesses and other facilitiesNone whatsoever other than being able to zone blocks of residential, commercial, and industrial areas, along with other specialized zones. You can't micromanage any individual businesses.*Everything and everyone movesCars and SimCitizens move, so do some animated buildings, but certainly not EVERYTHING.*Optional load-in sets for customization and enhancementsThat's handled much better in SC3K Unlimited.SimCity 3000 is a mixed bag for me. I love being able to play a fully updated version of 2000, but whether it should be called 3000 or 2100 is something of a dilemma.Graphics-wise, 3000 is beautiful! No two ways about it. A lot of hype has gone into the fact that you can now zoom in and see little sims walking, driving around in individual cars, and so on. The building images are now fully 4-sided entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each feature. Five zoom levels let you choose the size you're comfortable with to build on. Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated at the highest zoom. I don't have that problem, but they are definitely not the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are. They are merely enlargements of the 4th zoom. Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any zoom.Gameplay: here's the sticking point for me. If you've continued to play SimCity 2000 until you're red-eyed and guaranteed to be late for work/school, you'll probably do the same with 3000. Given all the new bells and whistles, it'll take some time to try them all and see how this affects that. From this point, however, two camps emerge. One camp will continue playing the game for years and loving every minute of it, relishing the freedom to create anything they want. I fall into this category. The other camp, once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will, are going to wonder what's the fun anymore. So depending on your expectations for the game it'll be either a gift from heaven or something you may well have wished didn't cost 40 to 50 bucks.As for difficulty, it's no harder really than 2000. Some of the new features like garbage disposal, ordinances, and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy without making the game unduly complex. Maxis should be commended for that.Overall? It's good. In fact it's very good. They put a lot of work into it making sure everything balances more or less. Is it worth the money? Not now with SC3K Unlimited out. Get it instead, as it's much more refined. If you haven't played a SimCity game before or if you're a diehard 2000 fan, absolutely. If you just sorta liked 2000 and quit playing it after a little bit, you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rack.",4,"It's better than SimCity 2000, but....",958521600,"05 17, 2000",0.2266

The graphics are outstanding, the music is ok, it is fun to look down and see vehicles driving on the streets and the people walking around. Even the sound effects match with the specific area of the city you are looking at. For example, high-crime residential areas feature sporadic gunfire, rapid footsteps and the clanging of a chain-link fence. the bustling commercial areas feature heavy traffic noises and sirens, and industrial areas have heavy truck and machinery noises. You control the layout of the streets and the zoning. Then the city develops itself, according to land values and access to transportation.The not-so-good: When areas become blighted and buildings are abandoned, the buildings become black boarded-up boxes that no longer resemble the original building style-- for example, a twelve story apartment building, when abandoned, becomes a three-story black box with boarded-up windows. You cannot have suspension bridges cross above highways or city streets. ALL the streets intersect (no way to build overpasses, except highways crossing streets) There is no way to build elevated rail lines-- the railroad must cross every street at an intersection. Also, you are mostly restricted to a north-south street grid systemOverall, this is a great game.
