There's always plenty to do, from finishing levels to completing timed flight races. Even if you beat the final boss in the game, you can keep playing to collect all the gems and find all the dragons. Once you do that, you get to open up new content!

2,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00000I1BF,"[0, 0]","I'm very reluctant to try the new Spyro game for PS2, or to buy the Spyro games available for Xbox because Spyro games have stooped to such a low quality I'm afraid to play them. But for the old Spyro games on PSone I have no fears because these ones were developed by Insomniac (Ratchet and Clank, Resistance: Fall of Man), the studio that made the good ones, but sadly no longer makes them. The story is about how Spyro has to rescue all of the dragons who have been imprisoned in crystal cocoons by Nasty Nork. The gameplay functions very well for an old platformer, and never really gives you much trouble because of how smoothly it handles. The flight mechanic works well, but you can't use it all the time. The graphics look nice for the time, but are feeble by today's standards. The environments are bright and colorful and still have a great feel to them. You will spend your time defeating lots of enemies, rescuing your dragon friends, collecting jewels, finding hidden locations, getting health by letting your dragon fly buddy eat butterflies, and have a lot of fun doing all this. As much as this might sound terrible to some gamers, it's actually not repetitive and boring, but in reality a lot of fun. The biggest flaw of the entire game is the camera. The camera is a bit difficult to handle, and will unfortunately cause a few cheap deaths. Also, this game in some ways feels a bit too easy because within a twenty minute period I located 14 dragons. Plus this game simply isn't as fun as it's sequels Ripto's Revenge or Year of the Dragon. But this game is too much fun to really complain about, and I can guarantee no matter what demographic of gaming you fall in you will have a lot of fun on Spyro's PSone adventures.",4,"STILL LOTS OF FUN, A PLATFORMING CLASSIC 8 OUT OF 10",1205625600,"03 16, 2008",ACEMAN1 HERE TO PISS YOU OFF,0.0831

In the second the graphics are solid, but the bad guys aren't the greatest bad guys and plus the levels look alike. Anyways, in this game you'll jump off prehistoric glaciers, face giant enemies, glide across cliffs and free enslaved Dragons, and collect gems and treasure. Sure, some parts of this game is a little frustrating, and sure, the camera angles are a bit awkward, but you get used to it and get the hang of it. It's a lot like RP games, where the first time you play it, it is incredibly hard, but once you beat it, you'll play it hundreds of times. I must have beat this game atleast thirty times. Probably forty. Anyways, buy it. It's worth your money. The graphics are fluid and spectacular, and at times this game can have some humor in it.

5,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000I1BF,"[3, 3]","Spyro the Dragon: the game that SHOULD have been Sony's mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot.The original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platform/adventure game you can find for the Playstation. I can't give Spyro's first adventure a 5-star rating, though. Let's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro (and believe me, there's a LOT of good things about this game).People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else. Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games. In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game. Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me. Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning. I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.Spyro's debut does have a few problems, though. Seeing as how this is Spyro's very first adventure I won't be TOO harsh. Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better? It's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro. Well, to be honest, I DID have trouble controlling him at first. Spyro doesn't QUITE take off when you hit up, down, left or right on the directional pad. There's a split second delay before moving forward. Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since, after all, you're moving a DRAGON. A BIG creature like a dragon won't move forward right away. Then again, Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue.Controlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first. For example, attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task. I kept sliding off. By the way, I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller. Master the controller before exploring the world. This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future.I have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles. Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games, you have to admit it isn't flawless either. If you hit Pause and go to the options, you will see an option for a second camera view called active. This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times. The other (default) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you're moving, and you can't get a good view of what lies ahead. You may want to change it to active if the other camera view is difficult for you. Thank goodness for this option!Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge. While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump. I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it. Many times you will fall to your death. Be patient, though. The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps. Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it. The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family. Good work.The biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss. He's really easy to beat, however, GETTING to him is a whole other story. You see, right at the very end before you face him, you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall (and you WILL fall the first few times because it's hard) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again. Not that the stage is really that long anyway, but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game. The other 99% of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there.With that said, don't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One. It DOES get harder. You see, many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head, or shooting fire at them. You won't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment. You also have to dodge fireballs, sword-swipes, dogs jumping at you, and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them. So it's not pathetically easy after all.A minor complaint is that sometimes while you're walking or running, the path will suddenly end, and you'll fall to your death. Doesn't happen often, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.I hate the way Spyro talks. He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice. Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like. Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to. The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them! For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide. Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide! So I didn't NEED his help! This happens a few times during the game. You just want to scream Thanks for nothing, bonehead!The music was done by a member of the rock band the Police, Stewart Copeland. People may not realize it, but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band. Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police, specifically the songs walking on the moon and message in a bottle. You'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs. The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you're in. No complaints. The music is fantastic.I think the creators made a mistake. When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise, and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise. It should be the other way around. Another thing that needs reversed: the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages. When you press up, you fly down. When you press down, you fly up! Strange mistake. This makes it harder to complete the flying stages, however, you don't have to finish them.In fact, despite what people may tell you, you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons. Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game. The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi's Island- you don't have to find everything, but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score. The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons, increasing the challenge. More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it. It's fun to run around and think about how to reach it. Some of them are cleverly located. One word to describe it- *awesome*Anyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on. Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game, and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today.",4,dragon madness!,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",B. E Jackson,0.1026

You travel with Sparx, your dragonfly companion and also your health gage, as you collect gems and go through six gigantic worlds with over 25 levels in all. This game is great, although it's not very challenging, it offers hour of entertainment. My favorite world is the Beast Makers world. It's a creepy place and almost all the levels in it take place at nighttime, which to me is the best type of level in Spyro. My favorite is Tree Tops because it is a gigantic level that gives you that creepy feeling, even the music is creepy in it's own way. Another minor flaw in this game is that it has no mini-games in it. Those always provide extracurricular fun, but I'm happy to say that they are introduced in a later Spyro release.

The character is an adorable baby dragon, with all the mannerisms of what a baby dragon might be, as if the creators modeled him from puppies & kittens, which is probably what they did.So little Spyro is set to explore in his homeland, where he derives sustainance from sheep, & questing for gems & treasures, perusing into archways & temples, & fending off sheepherders armed with staves. The Satanic implications are obvious. A dragon insinerating sheep for food...? Sheepherders protecting their sheep? Predator vs. prey...In certain situations, such as when killing a charging ram, smashing into walls, giants attacking, you will note the joystick vibrate, thereby making the gaming experience a bit more tactile.So the player is Spyro the Dragon, helped along with the advice of ancestors. It is remarkable how noble these mentors are, their voices echoing their arcane wisdom unto their young.In travelling, we also embark into Stone Creek, & the more aesthetically-pleasing Dark Hollow, where new creatures wander to be defeated, & more treasures to be plundered.

Now, it is almost 11 years later and I still absolutely love this game although its graphics are old-school compared to say the Wii's graphics or PS3's. But this game was good. It was not easy for me but with a little practice I got better. There is only one egg that still is a challenge for me to get and I don't remember the name of the sub-world it is in but it's the one with a whole bunch of trees. I always forget where to turn/jump to get the height and speed I need to reach the egg. But big deal, this game is how I remember Spyro and brings back fond memories.One reviewer had a good point when he said the dragons you release from the stone do give you some pretty redundant advice such as telling you how to glide after you just finished gliding to reach the little booger! But you can interrupt them which I always do so no biggie. The mini-games are fun and even though you don't have to complete them to finish the game there is a part of me that always has to complete the game 100%. I will hunt down every gem, every egg and every pink egg from those annoying blue things you chase.This isn't the best Spyro game but it is among the top three.

While some dragons are being interviewed about their world, the long banished Gnasty Gnorc overhears some less than positive comments about himself. In retaliation, he turns all of the dragon's beautiful gems (which reflect his face back at him) into Gnorc minions, and freezes the dragons in crystal prisons. All, that is, except one short little purple firebreather, who becomes the hero by taking it upon himself to defeat the Gnorcs and free all the dragons.You utilize two attacks; your flame breath, and your horn charge. Throughout the levels you encounter several types of enemies, but especially Gnorcs. Your goal throughout the game is to unfreeze all the dragons, and collect stolen dragon eggs from the taunting blue thieves. Each of the six homeworlds contains a non-mandatory boss battle (aside from the Gnorc Gnexus) and a balloonist who will transport you to the next homeworld. Your health meter is represented by a little dragonfly by the name of Sparx that follows you around. Sparx starts out bright yellow, dulls to blue, then to green, and once he is gone, you're toast.

The levels of the first world, Artisans, are super easy with a very easy boss. It's harder to GET TO the boss than it is to beat it. The levels just seem to keep getting just a tad bit harder, but nothing significant. The hardest boss is the boss of the second level and he isn't very hard either. Gnasty Gnorc is a surprisingly easy boss, once you figure out how to toast him. What makes this game annoying is that there is so much treasure, spread out into so many different places, that you will just rip your hair out in some of the levels trying to get it. But there are some pros. This game is a little bit long making for long lasting entertainment. The game also has great graphics with a frame rate that never slows down, and because between screens, the game is counting treasure, so it's like there's never a single load time. Also, some of the enemies are pretty funny, like in one level, if you do the right thing at the right time, the enemy will actually MOON you, and it's hilarious to see. Also, the controls are simple enough for anyone to figure out making for not much trouble otherwise. Some points of the game are hard like recovering stolen eggs from the theives, but besides that, this is an easy game that I would recommend to anyone below teenage age. The only reason I gave this game three stars was because I know most people like a good challenge, but it wouldn't be fair to give it four just because I personally like an easy game. Still good though.",3,"Aside all the complication and easiness, it's okay",972950400,"10 31, 2000",Mike Brennan,0.3751

I am no stranger to the series or this game in particular obviously. I bought this game almost only because of the nostalgic value it has to me. As well as the fact that I'm attempting to amass a collection of all game console systems and the best of their games, according to my own opinions.But on to the game itself. As the subject title implies, (for me) it is and always will be, a timeless classic in the history of videogames, as it is almost the first real game I ever played and actually tried and succeeded in completing. For the time, it's graphics were close to cutting edge, and the story is simple, yet actually completing everything 100%, is quite a difficult task depending on what part you're trying to do so on. The gameplay mechanics are a little stiff, but no more than expected from a game released in 1998 on a system that has been rebooted 4 times since the one this game was developed for. If you care at all about great games, or if you played this in your childhood, you're going to want this for your collection.",5,Spyro the Dragon.....A Timeless Classic Forever!,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",Mitch,0.2529

This is one of my favorite PS1 series of games, and i'd recommend all of these games to anyone in a heartbeat. This is a family friendly title, and a good game to own. Some of the game was a little challenging for me at first. i remember the ads, and wanting to have this game and the un-wasted excitement when i finally held the case in my hands.Spyro is the main character(obviously) a little purple dragon with Sparx(a dragonfly and his best friend) following him around, Sparx represents Spyro's health and proctects Spyro. He can only take so many hits or damage spyro should of recieved before Spyro is on his own and can only get hit once, to avoid this however you can ram or flame the sheep(called fodder) and they will turn into butterflies which Sparx eats in one bite for a life. The mission of the game is to free your fellow dragons who were all turned to crystal statues(Spyro wasn't tall enough to get hit by the spell), get the eggs and dragon treasure back, and beat Gnasty Gnorc who hates dragons and besides turning them into statues stole all the dragon treasure and the dragon eggs.",5,Spyro,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",Pokemon Master250,0.4186

33,AU9N4J6ZQDYO1,B00000I1BF,"[1, 1]","Do not be fooled by the fact that dragons are more suited to little kids and that the game appears like a cartoon. This is a very fun game in which an evil creature called Gnasty Gnorc scatters gems all over the dragon world, turns some into his minions, lets blue thieves into the dragon world to steal their precious dragon eggs, and encases all the dragons in crystal. He missed Spyro, so it's his job to turn the dragon world the way it was. The graphics are colorful and the sound and music are also nice, and as for replay value, it has a fairly good amount. If there is one thing to complain about, it is the difficulty level. The enemies don't put up too much of a threat, and finding gems and dragons is usually fairly easy, and even the bosses are pretty easy to toast. But it can prove quite a challenge to some people, and may include some testing with some things. But besides these two facts, Spyro the Dragon is a nice, colorful game that is well worth the money.",5,Spyro the Dragon Review,1038096000,"11 24, 2002",Richard,0.1622
34,A2X5BY0WP52C48,B00000I1BF,"[1, 3]","I own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made. I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges. Some good things about it is that this is the only Spyro game where you free the dragons. In the rest of the games, you help other people... It is funny and very interesting. ( Sorry, but I won't give the funny parts away. )The disadvanges is that you can't swim. In the other to games you can but in this game, if you touch the water you will die!!Another bad thing is that they don't have the cute characters like the other two games. I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1. I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line. I even think Spyro has a better voice. If you like all three Spyro's, try buying the Spyro pack. It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly.

35,A27HFEVFEECMF1,B00000I1BF,"[47, 47]","This game is a very fun game. Very well made. You play Spyro(DUH), a young dragon. All the other dragons(I think there are 60 or so of them), have been captured and turned to stone, and are scattered about in the different worlds. The Dragon Eggs have been stolen by theives who are running around and hiding in different worlds. The dragon's treasure is lying around everywhere(not to mention alot of it has been turned into enemies). And who is the cause of this? GNASTY GNORC. And now, as Spyro, you must save the dragons, find the eggs, collect the treasure and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. Ok, that's the plot basicall; now here is what the game is like: As Spyro, your mission is to(As I said before) save the dragons, find the tresure and rescue the eggs. Being a young dragon, your wings are not fully grown, so you can not fly. You can, however, glide over short distances. You also have the ability to(Of course)breathe fire and charge with your horns. There are several worlds throughout the game. Each of these worlds has one home level, and in each of the home levels, there are doorway/portholes through which lie other levels for the worlds. In each of the worlds there will be dragons, treasure and eggs.Dragons: These have been turned to stone by Gnasty Gnorc. To save them you simply find them, then walk up to them or charge at them or Flame them. They will then come back to life and talk to you before flying away. Some will give you advice, others will thank you, and some will just talk (sometimes insulting you).Treasure: Treusure is just lying around in different places. Most of the enemies turn into treasure(which looks like gem stones). Some treasure are in chests. Most chests can be rammed or flamed to open them, but some requre dynamite or fire works or other ways to open them.Eggs: These are held by theives. To get them, you must chase after the theif and ram or flame him.Enemies: There is a large variety of enemies (most enemies are really treasure that have been turned into minions for Gnasty Gnorc). Most can be killed by ramming or flaming, though some are armored and can only be hurt by flaming and not by ramming or visa versa. Some boss enemies, however, require special battle tactics.There are also fairies who will help you in some way. Some will catch you if your falling, and will move you to safety, while others will give you a Super Strong fire breath(which will allow you to flame armored enemies). Hovering above Spyro is a dragonfly. The color of the dragon fly shows you your current health. Green, if your have full health, and red if you are very hurt. He will disappear if you get hurt when he is red. In each home world there are guys with hot air ballons. These ballooners tell you what you must do in that world for them to take you to the next world (you can always return to past worlds later to pck up anything you might have missed). In most worlds you usually have to find a certain number of dragons, treasure or eggs. Finally, you will get to Gnasty's world, where you will have to fight Gnasty Gnorc.Well, that's &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;. I recommend this game to anyone who has Playstation.

Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games for the Gamecube counsel. Along with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarine of Time/Twilight Princess, and Hitman 2. But after playing thouse games on the sparkling Gamecube counsel, I turned my gaze to the dusty, gray Playstation, and out popped Spyro again!I'm actually replaying the game, I already beaten both of the two first worlds in under an hour. But it is a really good experience to play this old jewel again! I also own four other Spyro games: Spyro: Ripto's Rage, The Year of the Dragon (Both of thouse for my old Playstation and are VERY fun!) along with the alright, but not the same: Hero's Tale, and the crappy game some idiot thought up: The Legend of Spyro: A New Beggining. I despised thouse two games for what they had done to that cool, little dragon we use to know.But, alas! At least I saved my original game for times like these! Please, if you still have your old gray Playstation, (or a Playstation 2) than fish out Spyro from the attic or the closet and replay it!
