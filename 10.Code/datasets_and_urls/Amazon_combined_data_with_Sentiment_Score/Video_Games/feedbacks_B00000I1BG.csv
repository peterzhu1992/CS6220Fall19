Tenchu had competant graphics for the time, though ugly by 2012 standards. The controls definately had issues but lets face it, this is the best Tenchu game to date. Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments. Years later, the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certain games you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back. This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread. The first one is the best in the series, in my opinion. Priority was never graphics or packaging. It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack.",4,"Lets just face it, this is the best Tenchu game in history",1355184000,"12 11, 2012",0.1893

When I tried it back at home, I was blown away! This game was really sweet. And after I tried the demo of Ninja: Shadow of Darkness that was in my game Fighting Force, I realized I was lucky that I didn't waste my money on it.I would never trade this game in for that other stupid one. This game is incredible. Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front. Not only that, but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome: samurai, ninjas, bears, wolves, dogs, and all kinds of demons. This game is totally awesome, if a bit slow though. It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in Devil May Cry, it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime. Oh well, it was still a good game. If you're a true ninja fan, you must have this game... you won't regret it.",4,"Finally, a ninja game for Playstation!",1023321600,"06 6, 2002",0.0848

Tenchu finally takes the Ninja game to the next level. Not just a run around and throw stars at senseless, weak enemies, this game forces you to learn and master stealth and the art of sneak attack. The different weapons available keep the onslaught more versatile, and the different sword attacks seem to stun the viewer with there harsh and brutal images. A great game , a great story line, but still a few small problems. even though you have a large variety of weapons they are very limited. some of the game may be confusing, and not very straight forward as to what you are supposed to do, and you tend to run into some very annoying camera views that seem to definately take away from the game play. But overall it's a very entertaining game which i recommend to any action fan.",4,A true Ninja brought to gaming,964915200,"07 30, 2000",-0.1914
3,A7GXT5V1VL5UT,B00000I1BG,J. Leigh JL,"[5, 5]","I am a latecomer to Tenchu. Since it is a PS1 game its graphics really show the PS1's age against the PS2. However if you are willing to accept/ignore that difference you will find Tenchu a very satisfying and deeply fun game. This is most definitely one of PS1's best games.The game becomes more enjoyable the better you are able to master your ninjitsu skills. The controls are difficult to master at first, but stick with it and you will eventually be rewarded. I used to just jump off a roof and try and hack at my enemy. Now I can do a reverse back flip off a roof behind an enemy and exact a perfect kill. Far too cool.Pros:- Many many ways to finish a level.- Stealth is heart throbbingly fun.- Plentiful cheats for amateurs.- Wonderful soundtrack. I ended up buying a copy of the soundtrack too.- Variety of ninjitsu moves makes killing stylishly fun.Cons:- Since it is a stealth game you have to be very patient to make sure no one can see you before you go for the kill. This can take a long time.- Each level is long and the boss is at the end of the level. Dying in the boss' hands means you have to start the whole level from the beginning- No saves during a level.- Joypad controls are difficult to master- but are necessary to support all the ninjitsu moves.",5,Worth playing even for PS2ers,1044662400,"02 8, 2003",0.0963
4,A3D7OOFCKHZJJ1,B00000I1BG,Karl Jordan,"[3, 3]","The first Tenchu to come out (which is the reason why there isn't a number behind Tenchu) and the first Tenchu I have ever played, also the Tenchu that forced me to fall in love with the series. When I first played the game it was love at first sight, no one-night stand here, this one's a keeper. The game takes place in Feudal Japan; the game starts at the time period and impressively stays there through the entire game. You won't find anything you wouldn't find in the time period (Yes, Feudal Japan did have guns). Some people would complain about the over-exaggerated bloodshed and the sometimes-cheesey dialogue. I must disagree with these people these two factors made me enjoy the game even more. What the hell!?! Why would that make a game better? You maybe asking, well those two features made me feel as though I was watching an old Japanese Kung-Fu movie, minus the kung fu that's how I believe you must think of this game to fully enjoy it. After watching the ending I believe that's the effect the creators wanted to put in this game, after seeing the end sequence yourself you'll know what I mean. Of course the bad camera angles sometimes made this game annoying. In order to block your opponent's attacks you must hold down which a lot of the time backed you into a corner.... The reason I only gave it three stars? I don't think this is a game for everyone, that's why. I believe this game will be a rare collectible in the future, so buy this game now and save yourself future trouble.",3,A Gaming Great,1052092800,"05 5, 2003",-0.0081
5,APKPZZM0N9PSS,B00000I1BG,Kenny The write brother,"[0, 0]","This game offers unique play. It has a pretty good storyline that keeps your attention, but the stealth required to play the game makes it a keeper. Unlike Metal Gear, you actually loose points by being spotted, even if you make it through the mission successfully. You can opt to go through the mission again for a higher score, or you can go on to the next mission. I liked that aspect the most because the second time around (knowing where everyone is hiding and waiting for you) you get to get the drop on them! Cool beans.",5,Addictive,1014768000,"02 27, 2002",0.2292

7,A2UP4COAQ7UGBY,B00000I1BG,maninblue maninblue,"[5, 5]","I actually did purchase this game two times. I lent it out some years ago and never got it back. I recently noticed that the price is very modest so I picked it up again. Why? This game is an older generation game (PS1), but it is better than some PS2 games I have played that only advertise graphics but have poor gameplay or short game time. Tenchu is a satisfying game that lets you creep around, slice necks from behind, and hide out on rooftops. You will avenge the death of a crooked merchant, rescue a captive nijna, save a princess, destroy a fiendish cult, stop the spanish pirates, and fight a big boss with a bigger sword. Of course there are those who opppose this type of activity and thus will try to stop you. Its lots of fun running around, hiding, killing from the unseen. Its better while doing it while the great game soundtrack is playing. This game has very catchy music that brings you you right in. The graphics, like I said, are mediocre, but that wont make or break a game anyway. Gameplay makes the game and this game has plently. Plenty of enemies to defeat, two selectable characters, a bunch of ninja items to utilize, and the percect amount of levels.What isnt so good about the game? Each ninja only has a small amount of stealth kills to use. There are plenty of regular attacks to be diverse but only 3 stealthy kills. One kill is rarely used due to the fact that you have to be iun front of you r enemy to use it which is dangerous because he will see you. You usually do the neck slice (yawn). Another downside is that many of the ninja items you acuire will be useless. Since you can only carry 4, you will take ninja stars, bombs, paralyzing rice cakes, and the grapling hook. The others are junk or rare objects recieved as bonuses for completing the missions on a master ninja score. Again the graphics are dated. The enemy AI is a pretty stupid. You can run past an ememy warrior and duck behind a bush or tree and he wont know where you went. He will look around himself quick and resume his patrols, Where are you!?Its still a load of fun and can be a challenge at first to get a perfect rating and unlock secret items. Replay value is pretty darn good. You might get tired of it after beating it with both ninjas, but you will get a taste for it some time later. This game will not sit in a closet. Many PS2 games sit in my closet, but this dated PS1 game is in my PS2 right now.",5,I bought this game twice!,1044662400,"02 8, 2003",-0.0761

9,A2LY7GPTXH2A9B,B00000I1BG,Michael Anthony Hybridblues,"[0, 0]","This is a great stealth game and one of the first I ever played (besides Metal Gear Solid). I spent many hours on this just being sneaky. The main thing I liked about this is that it's not your typical run around hack and slash game. You actually had to think about what you're doing and what the outcome would be. The voice acting wasn't that great but it was at the time when this came out. I think most people's problem with this game (myself included) was the annoying camera angle at time but once you got used to it, it wasn't that bad. Definately a classic game in my book.",4,Great even for PS1,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",0.0973

11,A1SDNZZ5H1H82V,B00000I1BG,nemesis,"[1, 1]","I was brought into the Tenchu series with Wrath of Heaven (not a great place to start...), but after renting and eventualy buying the third Tenchu instalment, I made it a point to track down the originals. I'm writing this review in 2005, a time of Metal Gear Solids, online Splinter Cells, and innovative Hitman games. Yet this title, released in 1998, still impresses, and is well worth effort of tracking it down and buying. Some things a buyer needs to heed however is the lack of analog control. For gamers raised on analog controllers, this game may be a little hard to manage at first. Also, the game, which emphisises stealth and patience is not without a frustrating moment or two, as the camera can be troublesome in places, and there is no in game save feature (try spending 2 hours working to get a good rank on a level, only to be killed by the level's extremely difficult boss, and be sent back to the begining...). All together, the game features an impressive aray of Ninja weapons and items, decient replay value, two playable characters and a good story that sets the stage for several sequels. While it may feel simplistic to gamers hardened on newer stealth titles, and the graphics may not feel as polished, Stealth Assassins is a difficult chalenge and rewarding experience for anyone willing to overlook some simple flaws, and who possesses a good deal of patience. I highly recomend it.",5,ninja sim,1119916800,"06 28, 2005",0.1295
