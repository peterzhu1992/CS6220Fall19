0,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000007NJC,B. E Jackson,"[0, 2]","I *hate* this game. Let me state right away: graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me. The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good (and original, back in the day) but who cares? It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic, and their movements true to life. Who cares? When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90's yeah, the graphics WERE cool. Not now, especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.You know, WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level. A whole new level of crap. You see, it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same. Let me explain why this is a bad thing.You know when you buy an updated sports video game (such as football or hockey) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names, and maybe some new options here and there? That's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games. For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other, and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.It doesn't matter if it's Smackdown, Smackdown 2, WWE Raw for the Xbox, WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube, etc. Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism. I'm all for realism, but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game. A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it. And I can't have fun with a wrestling game released today that, more or less, is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago. It makes me sick to think 10 years later, hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.Before WWF War Zone, you had WWF In Your House which, to this day, is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games (along with WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game). Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis. Once again, the formula in those old-school wrestling games didn't stick around and overstay its welcome. Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64, it all went wrong. Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games, so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances, and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach. It's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing. After a while you get sick of it.WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights, but it was the WORST thing that could have happened. Graphically, WWF War Zone is the first of its kind. Being the first means it's bound to have some flaws (despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw!) Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is. After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House, we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly. Painfully slow, in fact. Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race. Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game. To be fair, the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed. Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.WWF War Zone also started the popular create a wrestler mode. But it doesn't matter because, as I mention above, wrestling games for 10 years have had that option. It's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill, and it's time game companies got rid of it, or did something to drastically change it. It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now, 10 years later, I don't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it, so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away. No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today, instead of repeating the same formula every year, I wouldn't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began. After 10 years, updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesn't get the job done.",1,the absolute low point,1152748800,"07 13, 2006",-0.0542
1,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B000007NJC,J. Paul John doe,"[0, 0]","This is my 400th review & I really can't believe the past 3 or 4 years have gone by so quickly. I mean almost 4 years ago I came on here & started with video game reviews then I ranted on movies that I hate which turned into reviewing movies I love. The 8 months on this account I have been reviewing old wrestling show I reviewed a lot of the old NWA-WCW s Pay Per Views I have just started with reviewing WWF PPV's this past Friday I reviewed Survivor Series 1995. I'm going to review In Your House 5 Seasons Beatings soon. WWF Warzone released inj July of 1998 for The Playstaion & Nintendo 64. This game I feel gets undeserved flack it's not as good as The THQ games on The N64 like The WCW games or the 2 WWF games or any of the THQ games on The Playstion or PS2. But this game is better than most of the wrestling games put out by AKKLAIM previously. This game & WWF Attitude were the only good wrestling games put out by AKKLAIM. I have The Playstaion version which was the version I played the most. I bought it again recently cause my N64 doesn't work anymore. So getting into the game you have Challenge mode which is a career mode where you go after The WWF Intercontintal Championship & The WWF Championship. When you play through it you have wrestlers challenge you to a rematch it will be either a normal match a weapons match or a cage match. Thankfully when I as Stone Cold I didn't have to face Ahmed cause The Playstaion check out fun with Ahmed on youtube. If you do win The WWF title you can keep on defending it & opponets become harder & can evade your attacks. Then you have normal versus mode where you fight a random opponet the wrestlers you can play as are Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels who retired for 4 years before this game came out due to a back injury. Ahmed Johnson who left The WWF before this game came out. The Rock who was in between being Rocky Miavia & The Rock. Bret Hart who as we all know was in WCW when the game came out. But it is fun to play as Bret Hart the most easy wrestler to play as. Owen Hart. Farooq, Goldust, Undertaker, Kane, Mankind, Ken Shamrock, The British Bulldog who left The WWF in late 97 due to what happend in Montereal. Mosh & Thrasher. So this is more like the late 1997 roster but no wrestling game I've played had a totally up to date roster. You have tag team mode it would've been nice if you could've went for The WWF Tag titles. You have weapons match which is a no disqualification match. Cage match where you face an oppent in a Steel Cage match. You just have to beat your oppent up until there health meter is in the red & climb over it. The Nintendo 64 version had Royal Rumble & Gauntlet Matches. You have training mode where you can learn the moves come up with stradegy when you play as whoever you want. The only problem is you can't do your finishing move in training mode. Look online how to do the finishing moves & there not really that difficult to pull off. You have create a wrestler mode back then it was neat now it's just not that great. But you can listen to the wrestlers enterance themes you can listen to them in The Bio's as well & The Playstaion version had the real themes while The 64 had chip tunes but they really weren't bad at all. You have options mode where you can save the game adjust the difficulty set the time of the match. You have the basement where all the unlockables are at if you want you have to play through on medium or hard with a certain wrestler to get stuff unlocked. I enjoy playing through as Austin Bret Hart is fun to play as cause of all the ways he has to work the legs. I mean if you're just getting started playing this game then guys like Bret Hart, Owen Hart, The British Bulldog & Shawn Michaels would be the best for beginners. Undertaker & Kane are also fun to play as. There is an option where you can check your stats that shows how many wins & losses you have. I do like that if you or your opponet repeats the same move over & over again the crowd will boo you. But when you do different moves & bigger moves then they will cheer you. Although I don't think AKKLAIM knows what a pump handle slam looks like cause a belly to back suplex is called in this game. You get commentary by Jim Ross & Vince McMahon. Warzone is a great game when you learn how to play it, it is pretty fun. The only problems I had was tag team mode feels like it's broken at times. Like you partner will just stant there & let the pin be broken sometimes the opponet won't break the pin & let his partner be pinned. I wish they would've included The Royal Rumble in The Playstion version. More wrestlers could've been put in the game The Road Warriors who returned to The WWF in 1997 guys like D'Lo Brown& Kama from The Nation Of Domination & I wish Brian Pillman could've been put in the game. If I ever get WWF Attitude then I'll review it.",4,400th review WWF Warzone,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",0.2231
2,ASCR6RUWOU1F9,B000007NJC,Kane's Review,"[0, 0]","When I first got this game, I found it to be boring not too soon after getting it. When I play it today, I still think it's boring! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation. I don't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise, but more Mortal Kombat like.War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998, featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game, you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, The Rock, Triple H, Mankind, Goldust, Owen Hart, Ahmed Johnson, Farrooq, British Bulldog, Ken Shamrock, and The Headbangers.The opening of the game is cool, as you're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s. From there on, you're taken to the menu screen that's in the form of an elevator. In the menu you can look at the wrestlers' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game. There's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.Once you enter the game, you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode. Among the match types available are Singles, Tag Team, Tornado Tag Team, Hardcore, or Steel Cage. The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play. When you climb the cage, I didn't know what button to push to climb down. I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring. I lost most of the Cage matches.Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship. Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play. Once you play one match, you've played them all. You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones. As you progress through, you'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match. Oh yeah, that's another thing. If you lose 1 or 2 matches, you're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up. It ultimately screws you over and you're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.Overall: I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now. In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this. Even the sequel game to War Zone, Attitude, is more fun to play than War Zone. So if you don't want to be bored, skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead",2,Boring Game!,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",0.0066
