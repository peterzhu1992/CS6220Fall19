1,A9998RE3AEA95,B000006OVE,Alex,"[0, 6]","This is the perfect RPG for beginners, since it gives you the very basics of gameplay, but nothing amazingly spectacular except for a few interesting bits that will fuel your interest in the genre. Just be aware of the fact that this game is rather dull.My two reasons for not liking the plot is that: A) there is no central villain (and no villain at all for some three quarters of the game), so you basically get into combat for no reason at all; and B) next to none of the six characters in your party exhibit anything close to a personality (unless you count the fairy-style innocent frolicking a personality). Well, naturally, a couple of minutes before the final battle you are introduced to an actual villain (&quot;Kill the Goddess! Kill the Goddess!&quot;), but the personality (or lack thereof) problem is never fixed. Also, throughout the entre plot, the writers seem to be trying to tap into a wealth of nostalgia when there simply isn't one. This game has it all: friends parting and meeting again; runaway princesses; guilt-ridden characters; many-year lapses; characters willingly dying in combat against you; cameo appearances of characters from past BoF games; and much, much more.The combat in the game is handled in the standard RPG fashion: turn-based, hit points, magic points, levels, you know the drill. Oh, yes, there is the famous &quot;turn-into-dragons&quot; bit, but there is no change in the interface - you merely look different and have different spells for the duration of combat. I do not like the way combat is handled graphically - the characters simply square off against the foes (there is no special battle screen) and swing into the empty space until the foe is dead. There are also a few annoying bits (it takes eight seconds to escape from combat; during the eight seconds the characters merely stand in place; it takes equally as long to quit menus; you travel far too slowly, etc., etc., etc.)The music is nothing overly spectacular. In fact, I rarely even noticed it. The graphics feature 2D sprite characters on pale, low-detail 3D backdrops, bu since you can rotate them, the illusion of the characters blending in is lost.Like I said above, this is a nice trial run of the genre. Nothing spectacular but nothing horrid.",3,The ultimate mediocre RPG,965260800,"08 3, 2000",-0.0751

3,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B000006OVE,Ben Rowland,"[0, 0]","With the genre monopolized by the the Final Fantasy series, it is not suprising that this game is absent from most people's top RPG list. To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun.The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom). The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners. And while the graphics are not on par with Final Fantasy IX or Chrono Cross, this is still a great looking game.Try it.

4,A3OXJB66H8LU8C,B000006OVE,Bradford Fritz,"[6, 7]","Breath of Fire III's old-school graphics capture the feel of old RPGs, and how good they were, playing on NES and Super NES, back in the old days. Now I still play SNES, playing such good games as Super Godzilla, Breath of Fire I, and the Final Fantasy series. The storyline goes as follows--Ryu is a survivor of an ancient race of dragons, the Brood, which nearly destroyed the world. However, he is a good dragon. He allies himself with Yraall Region thieves, Rei and fellow dragon Teepo, who at the time doesn't know he's a dragon. He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia, Princess Nina, and the daughter of a smart scientist, Momo, a mutated vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game, and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa who's race once fought and defeated the dragons in a war, Garr. Together they quest to find Ryu's origin and other members of his race, and to find out if Ryu is evil or not. With beautiful music, surroundings, and a great storyline, this is one of the best RPGs of all--with many mini-games abound and a fantastic battle system. Definitely get this if you're a fan of Capcom RPGs.",5,By far one of the best RPGs in the world,967334400,"08 27, 2000",0.1696
5,A2OVX97R347HXC,B000006OVE,chiatroll,"[0, 9]","Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs. Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games consider the best. Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most. I expected a lot from breath of fire 3. Perhaps this helped lower my opinion of Breath of fire 3, but I did not like this game.As far as game play goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a dragon. Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one for a while. While you're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1. All the character seem to get their own special power. The character list is short and one of the characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character. The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind of pointless weird and honestly I didn't like it. The town to town walking is slow and you never get fast transportation.As far as plot goes the plot is the plot starts off okay. Then about two hours in goes in a different direction. It is fine for a while then but around the end is a large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much of a climax. They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the Tales Of Destiny ending. Also the characters don't have very strong and noticeable personalities. Also if you keep up with it you won't like the direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.As far as control goes it's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about it.The graphics to this game are not very good. It is done in sprites. Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings of this game. On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and short. The drawings are basic and too simple. There was only one of the dragons I liked the look of. However there is a little onion that can follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a single character. The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to buy this game if you do.And finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting the game is longer them many RPGs won't be beaten on a short rental. If you get this game buy it.Overall this game is the worst of the BoF series. I don't recommend buying it unless its finishes some collection you are working on, or if you have to see a hopping onion follow people around.",2,Just didn't meet my expectations.,964742400,"07 28, 2000",0.0555

9,A3NLXQW8OMZRO7,B000006OVE,Hagar,"[1, 3]","After defeating Xenogears, I was looking for a game that was fun to play, and didn't require me to do much thinking. Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic, yet confusing plot that really made you think. Breath of Fire 3 is a complete change of pace. Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF7 and Xenogears, Breath of Fire 3 continues a simple, but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears.Breath of Fire 3 doesn't have an overly confusing story. Once long ago, there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan. After gaining enough power to destroy the world, the dragon clan suddenly disappeared. You play as Ryu, a young boy who suffers from amnesia. He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo. After he gets into trouble with the authorities, he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan. So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past.Sound original? Sorry, but if it's originality that you want, you won't find it here. Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal. As you play it, it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it. The story, the battle system, everything feels like it was used many times before, and i hate to say this, but the ending is very disappointing.However, with all gripes aside, Breath of Fire 3 is a fun and engaging quest. My favorite part of the game was the characters; they are interesting, and very funny. I also liked that the plot never once got confusing. Even though it was unoriginal, it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat.With all the complaints aside, Breath of Fire 3 is fun game to play through. After playing through a monster game like Xenogears, it is refreshing to play. Unfortunately, don't get too excited about the ending.",4,"Breath of Fun, and Unoriginality",973296000,"11 4, 2000",0.1285

11,A3EU0FX5OZZ32P,B000006OVE,neomurtle,"[1, 4]","Breath Of Fire 3 is a traditional RPG with a combination of 3D and 2D graphics. The characters are what one would expect from a BOF game. The battle layout is well done for the most part, even though the loading time for some commands is just horrible. The Masters system is a cool idea, as you can shape your characters into any class you want by apprenticing them to the right master. The feature that keeps BOF 3 from reaching classic status is the story. It starts out interesting, but about halfway through the game it seems to lose it's purpose. Another annoying aspect is the desert area near the end of the game. The directions they give you are vague and confusing. Worst of all however, is after all the long hours you put into playing the game, the ending is short and stale. If you are a seasoned RPG fan and have played through all of the other RPGs for Playstation, BOF 3 will keep you busy until the next big hit arrives. If you hate puzzles and long loading times however, Breath Of Fire 3 may not be your game.",3,"Starts out great, but loses steam near the end of the game",982886400,"02 23, 2001",-0.196
12,A20ICHD4VQFAYO,B000006OVE,Ryan Bancroft,"[2, 2]","Breath of Fire III is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought. I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation. Innovation is necessary, and appreciated, but games like BOF3 need never disappear. It caters to the old-time gamer in all RPG veterens, delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay. And what gameplay! It's simplicity and charm will, hopefully, impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit. Last, I must mention the fishing system. It's incredibly addictive, simple, and enjoyable. Nothing else could more easily describe it. Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait, and you'd have a full game that I would have to own! It's that good. For everyone: whether an RPG-newbie or a hardcore veteren, you should give this game a chance. Fun doesn't begin to describe it.",5,A throwback to the good old days.,1018915200,"04 16, 2002",0.3041

The story and side quests kept me going.One of the downers was that you can't hardly change your angle.A big thumbs up going to the fact that you don't have to change screens to get into a battle (like Chrono Trigger).

14,AQMWZIH22R6LE,B000006OVE,TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore,"[3, 3]","Breath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the fun-but strictly orthodox-Super NES title, Breath of Fire II. Although BOFIII isn't a radical departure from the earlier games in the series, don't let that turn you off; it's reassuring to see that sprite graphics haven't given way entirely to origami-style polygons. Sporting a quasi-medieval European setting, a heroic story line, and turn-based battles, BOFIII will appeal to fans of Square's Final Fantasy series and Working Designs' Lunar titles. An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before it's captured. The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu, who is befriended by a pair of delinquents, whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people. Ryu is left for dead, but his dragon powers revive him, so he sets off in pursuit of his friends' captors, unaware that he's about to be drawn into an ever-deepening pool of danger, deceit, and death. Like earlier BOF titles, Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey. Nina, the princess of Windia, makes another appearance in the series, although in this game she's apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations. Ryu, too, shares the name of a character from the series, but he's also unrelated. However, Gobi, from the first BOF game, makes a cameo appearance. Nostalgic Graphics Graphically, BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Texture-mapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds, terrain, and buildings, while sprites are used to compose the various characters. More animation, colors, and special effects have been added to this version, but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games. The three-quarter-overhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles, but not to any great extent. Battles are fought directly on the field map, with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions: Two are seen from the front and two from the rear.Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turn-based, with some consideration given to quickness: Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter. For example, in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down. Also, certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting. Beyond the usual manual, magic, and item attacks, characters can transform into dragons. Initially, only Ryu has the power to transform (and only when he's far into the game), but the other characters gain that power later. Transformation, though, requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP (magic points) for the Genes chosen. By combining up to three Genes, different dragons can be created; the more Genes you use, the more powerful your dragon, though you'll use more AP. AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle. Finally, you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells. The construction of Breath Of Fire III's battle system-and of the whole game, for that matter-is very polished-thanks to excellent controls. You won't be moaning about the way this game handles. Sound Bites However, all isn't well in BOFIII. The sound effects are fine, if not particularly inspired. In battle, the characters emit rudimentary shouts, screams, and spell names, but not much more. And even though the sounds can get annoying, they're not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack. The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz, and more often than not, it doesn't add to the atmosphere of the story. The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG. Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack, BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans. Although it doesn't possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII (which few games will ever accomplish), Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evident.",4,It keeps getting better,1065225600,"10 4, 2003",-0.1081
