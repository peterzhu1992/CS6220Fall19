1,A2N1C9JKI2C5XD,B00000J98X,An amazon visitor,"[0, 5]","Honestly, there's nothing good about this game. The graphics are NOT at all what the playstation console has the ability for. The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation. If you like games with good graphics, do not get this game.The gameplay isn't that great, also. The N64 version is much better, because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic, and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.I swear, play a demo or atleast rent the game, (I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent) and check out the graphics. Plus, in order to know the story of this game, you have to read the direction book. I can't remember it word by word, but it went something like this: Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth, when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A. Okay, so the story sounds good...but why wasn't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story? And plus, all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didn't have much money at the time, so they decided to make a mediocre game. This was bad. Believe me.If you want a game with good gameplay, excellent graphics, wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it, get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.If you want a game with awful graphics, bad gameplay, no storyline sequences, and a Sega Genesis feel, then get this game.This game is not worth any money at all.",1,"How can anyone like this game at all, really?",1026604800,"07 14, 2002",0.2316
2,AT2Q0SZB3UWEH,B00000J98X,Beavis The Great Cornholio,"[0, 2]",I've been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time. I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes. Total Meltdown is the most frustrating FPS I have ever played. The speed is so fast it is hard to move. Looking up and down is a chore.You use L1 and L2 to look up and down. Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible. Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible. Sound is bad as well. The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebook(it is funny). The only semi-detailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations. Even the cutscenes are bad. Please try to avoid this game and save some cash.,1,Terribly Disapointing,1232841600,"01 25, 2009",-0.0135

DN:TM is a fun but dated by today standards, it does play on the PS3 but the graphics kind of spazz out when the screen goes red from lighting, the gameplay is rather tough even on the easy setting but who cares, this is still a fun game to play and once you get used to the controls it's even better.",5,Hail to the King Baby!!!!,1330905600,"03 5, 2012",0.3248
4,ACR88YH63OJLN,B00000J98X,Dr. Kill,"[2, 3]","Today i saw this game at the store for 12 bucks, and i'm gonna pick it up since i have a PS2. I rented it 2 times (after that the dumb stores got rid of their copies) and it was better than the sega saturn version. The graphics didn't have the neat lighting effects, but the game was a whole lot more like the pc version. If you have a PC get that version, if you have a ps2 get this version, or both. I'm probably one of the biggest Duke fans in my area, i have the origional Duke 3D for PC, the Atomic Edtion , The sega saturn version(my 1st copy), Duke Manhatten Project, Time to Kill, Land of the Babes, the Duke Nukem album, all of the Duke Nukem action figures, The Duke Nukem screen saver pack, and now this. As the great Duke would say Holy S@$T! Any way if you are one of the few who don't have a PS2 yet here's what will happen to this game.. You know how these losers say the game looks flat? Lie! You know how they say the N64 version looks better? They fogot to tell you the game is cut up (no nude chix), and the textures are super-low res. But with this vesion, when you set up your PS2 for smooth texture mapping, it will make all the 2D images get smooth edges, and the textures will be nice and smooth. Since the game is almost all sprites(which isn't realy a bad thing at all, easier to edit on pc) Every image on screen will look close to a PS2 game! The reason i don't give this 5 stars is because you can't edit it like the PC version.",4,"A good game, when played on a PS2.",1031702400,"09 11, 2002",0.0742

That's due to the fact that DUke Nukem can make ANYTHING and EVERYTHING look good. Hell, he can even make taking a dump look awesome! The one thing I've noticed about Duke over the years is that he doesn't have and hair on his balls, then I realized that hair doesn't grow on steel!",5,Duke Nukem: THE KING!!!!!!!,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",0.0911

I thought it was the coolest game ever, and i still think it's my favorite playstaion game. And im 17 now. It's a classic duke nukem game, i know the graphics aren't the best and a lot of the stuff is cheesy about the game, but regardless it's fun to play, and is easily a classic. :)",3,Smoke'm if U Got'em!,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",0.25
7,A1JHJ48J9EZNMH,B00000J98X,Robert evans,"[0, 1]",Duke Nukem is a pretty cool series. I use to own some of the Nukem Games...I happen to buy this game along time ago at a game store called GameMax..They had it for 4 bucks...It was pretty sweet. The graphics were terrible but Hey it was on the Play station. The game play was kinda slow but still good. I don't know if this is and edited copy of the game...I can tell you is that in this version I got for PS1 you do see women take there braws off when you pay em' cash..But they have stars...Literaly covering there nips..And it also has a type of color...The one that matches there bra..The games violence is over the top. But still it's a winner...I happen to like the N64 versio more then this even though there isn't Brief nudity like The ps1 version But in the N64 version there is more violence...The bodies explode when you shoot them again after there dead. You can't do that in the PS1 version but that doesn't really matter.Duke Nukem Total Meltdown is recomended for a mature audience since this game does have over the top pig exploding violence plus you go to an Adults Only Book store and there are half naked strippers with stars on them.I had fun with this game. It kinda pissed me off cause you didn't get to do all the stuff you can do in the PC version But I still liked it. Over all it's a mediocer version.I do not recomend this version at at all! Get the PC version! Or the N64...I donno I just liked that version.It's a great Duke Nukem Game...Later...,2,Eeeeh not the best version...,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",0.2342
