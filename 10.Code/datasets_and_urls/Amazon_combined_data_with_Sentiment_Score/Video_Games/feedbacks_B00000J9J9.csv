I mean all it is is an exact duplicate of the 1985 NES version converted to the Game Boy with a few extra modes of gameplay and extras added into it. I suppose for those who were to young and have not experienced the 8 bit Nintendo days it is good for them to experience the game too. But lets face it if there is any game that most video gamers have played at some point in there lives Super Mario Bros for the Nes is it. All this Game Boy version is is a fine conversion of the first Super Mario Bros to the handheld console and not much more.

Normally, this idea would have sold millions of copies but Nintendo went an extra mile or two. Super Mario Bros Deluxe is the original game plus extra content that equaled a must buy title. If you were a Game Boy Color owner, you immediately bought this and played the hell out of it.The PROS: You get the original Super Mario Bros, a You Vs. Boo mode where you race against a ghost through some of the game stages, a 2 player VS mode where you and another place race against each other (connected via the cable link), a Challenge mode where for each stage you have to find 5 red coins, a Yoshi egg and beat the high score. There's also extra content like the ability to print images from the GB printer (sold separately), a program that tells you where the Yoshi eggs are hidden, a built in calendar and a fortune teller program.The CONS: None.It's a must own title back then and a real treat to play nowadays if you still have the Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance SP. It was cool to bring around the original game with you (with the ability to save anywhere) but the extra modes and content really made it worth its price.

So where did his fame come from? A package game for the original Nintendo. The problem is to experience on the original system you need to find a NES and you have to hope it still work. And I've never known how legal emulators are. Thankfully Nintendo rereleased the game a few times ( Super Mario all-stars/SNES Wii, NES Classic/ GBA, Virtual Console/Wii 3ds WiiU, And Super Mario Bros Deluxe/ Gameboy Color GBA ) This might be the best. It kept the original look unlike all-stars which might put some disappointed but it is a look that can't be beaten. It add a save feature, Boo race, red coin hunt, and even achievements! This is the best singular port of the game. If you want you can also get the Nes classic version, but this is the best port on a gameboy system.

8,A329PQ0WJOIZL5,B00000J9J9,jdealy999,"[1, 1]","I started playing this game a few months ago and just completed all of it. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe features not only the 1985 NES original levels, but also the Japanese version levels that North American players couldn't have before. At that particular time, the only other way that anyone could access those levels was to play Super Mario All Stars for the Super NES/Nintendo Wii. However, the NES Japanese levels were finally included on this 1999 Game Boy Color port/remake. (For those of you history buffs, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. was actually named Super Mario Bros. 2. The North American version of SMB2 was completely different and released in 1988 with Wart as the main archvillain, not Bowser.)I actually find the Japanese version of the levels very satisfying and much more challenging. Some unusual effects will happen, such as Mario/Luigi jumping off a trampoline and into the air off screen for a couple of seconds, entering a negative warp pipe that brings you back several worlds (i.e., instead of going FORWARD), or seeing Goombas walking in the water levels.Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is one of those games that I could NEVER ever quit playing, even if I wanted to. So stop reading this already and get this game!! Sadly, Super Mario Bros.

When I went to Target to get a game, since Pokemon Pinball wasn't there, I got this game instead. I realized that this game was a better choice than Pokemon Pinball. First off, the graphics are marvelous, and proves that GBC is just as good as the NES, if not better. Another thing good about this game is the new save system(I knew it was new because I had a friend who had the original for the NES). They also installed a new challenge mode which is very tough, but later in the game, there is a new item in the Toy Box that gives hints to where all the Yoshi Eggs are. The Toy Box has options like Fortune telling which can be very amusing(And get you five more lives to start with if you get an Extremely Lucky card) and tons of printouts for the Game Boy Printer. You might also want to have a Link Cable and a friend with this game handy for the Vs. Mode. In this mode, you can race your opponent on the special race courses. You can also play this mode in one-player, with Boo as your opponent. There is also a new Photo Gallery, which takes a picture every time you do something new, like stomp a new enemy, or trade high scores with a friend with the Infared sensor. Yes, I said high scores, another new feature. But this is all aside from the main game. The game isn't really too challenging until the last world, but I noticed that you can jump higher in this game than any other 2D Mario adventure I've played so far. Once you beat the main game, you get the Star levels, which are a little more challenging anyway. And once you get the high score, you can get to the Lost Levels, which are EXTREMELY hard, and the last of them has TWO Bowsers!

15,A1X4JO8EJ1U5BR,B00000J9J9,Mike London MAC,"[7, 7]","For you Mario freaks who want to play the original, or those ones who are new to video games and don't have an old NES (which, sadly, are becoming increasingly rarer as time goes on), this is a good substitute. It doesn't quite capture the magic many of us old school gamers can remember the first time we saw that screen on our TVs. But the Golden Age of the video gaming industry has passed, and we must continue on. Sorry for getting nostalgic, but there's still nothing quite as memorable these days as playing the old NES years ago, with a lot of friends gathered around. Perhaps I romantize that era to much of the video game industry, but I have a lot of good memories from that. That's how boys bond (and also men - me and my best friends still go and play the N64 --- the latest wrestling game from THQ and Goldeneye always come in handy). And for those parents who are concerned with some of the more mature elements in gaming these days - don't worry, Mario doesn't have anything to be concerned about.Anyway, this includes some new features, like challenges (find Yoshi's Egg, 5 red coins, and beat a specified high score), races with Boo, a Toy Box (or something along those lines), and some trophies. Also, more intriguing, is that that included the Japanese SMB II or Lost Levels for us American and UK folks or gamers I mean. You have to get 300,000 points on the original, and then Luigi's head will appear on the gaming menu. Its retitled SUPER MARIO BROTHERS FOR SUPER PLAYERS, and you have to be one to beat it, the difficulty level is so high. It took us a good 13 years to get the game in original 8 bit format. One thing about the screen: its not big enough to get the entire game inside it, so they have Mario look up and down.All in all, a good adaptation. Still, it'd be nice to see the release of more games like this -- mainly the first two LEGEND OF ZELDA games on one cart. Why don't they do this?? Perhaps with the release of the two new GB Colour Zelda games (they divided one game into halves and stuck it on the remaining two) we'll see a release of those two classic Zelda titles. Other than emulation or on the 8-Bit they're unavailable. That's a real travesty.Mike London",5,"Its back and bigger than ever, but is it better?",981849600,"02 11, 2001",0.3478

Having not played the game in years, I was craving some Mario and decided to dust Super Mario Bros. Deluxe off; I'm glad that I did.

There is huge replay value to be had here, which comes in the form of an additional full game, side challenges, and other minigames. While the original Super Mario Bros. was pretty challenging, the developers have added a save anytime and endless continues to ease the frustration level of the player. The only demerit the game gets from me is the fact that the whole game doesn't fit on the screen, so you have to move up and down accordingly, which caused me to lose a couple lives because of an enemy that I couldn't originally see on the screen.

When the NES was released in 1985, the game that shipped with the system was the instant classic Super Mario Bros. And what better way to kick off the first year of the Game Boy Color's life than with a true Mario game? The Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is a pixel-by-pixel translation of the original NES game, with a ton of added features. And because the original Super Mario Bros. still holds up extremely well after all these years, Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is an absolutely fantastic game that borders on perfection ? perfection in Game Boy standards, of course. There are many different modes in the game, but the main game is the 1985 classic Super Mario Bros. 32 levels of platform-hopping gameplay where you must go through the world, jumping on enemies and collecting coins, making your way to the next castle before time runs out. Collect 100 coins and you've earned a secret life. Make sure you jump on...aww, skip it. You've played this game before. What you haven't played are the new modes injected in the Game Boy Color version. The Vs. Mode requires two Game Boy Colors and a link-cable, but this game is a whole lot of fun. It's a race to the flag pole between Mario and Luigi, and you'll try to screw each other up by hitting triggers that will put blocks up in the way. Very cool use of the original Super Mario Bros. engine, and worth the purchase of another cartridge just for this feature alone. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe also has a Challenge Mode, where you'll have to find five red coins and a Yoshi egg, as well as beat the level's preset score to finish the level completely. This is pretty darn difficult, hope you have a lot of patience. When I say pixel-perfect, I mean it. Even though the Game Boy Color screen has less resolution than a standard television, the developers have translated the same pixel count for every object in the game, from Mario to the koopas, turtles, even the question-mark blocks. Granted, this reduces the screen visibility somewhat, but the developers have added user-controlled screen-scrolling to the mix. If you want to see above or below where you're standing, it's all a matter of pushing up or down on the pad. All 32 levels, from 1-1 to 8-4 are patterned after the levels in the NES classic. Nothing's changed. Well, that's not exactly true, you can now save your game in progress, something you could not do in the original. It also remembers which levels you've completed, and unlocks secrets based on how many you've finished. So it's not always a good thing to find the warp zones so early in the game. Secrets? That's right. As you complete certain tasks in the game, you open up little hidden trinkets. Things like a Photo Album where you can print out earned pictures on your Game Boy Printer, or a Toy Box where you can make messages and print them out. Oh, and just because they could, the developers stuck in a fortune teller (just think Mario Magic 8 Ball) and a calendar option where you can enter important dates and save them to a cartridge. Do they need to be in there? Of course not. But they're cool additions nontheless. Super Mario Bros. remains one of my top 10 favorite games of all-time, even though it's almost a decade and a half old. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is such a perfect translation, it makes me wonder if it's easy to port NES games to the Game Boy Advance. Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is the Game Boy Color-specific game to own, hands down, and will be the title that, hopefully, will key a revolution of porting NES games to the handheld system. Buy this game.
