You have a colorful array of weapons and about 70 different vehicles at your disposel. But over-all, the story-line is a little predictable, and the objectives are a little frustrating, but it is a pretty cool game.",3,Bugs invade...You go back in time...Classic story-line.,994204800,"07 4, 2001",-0.1918
2,AKY8U3YZNJN3O,B00000IKQH,Droges grubby-1,"[0, 0]","Time hero preventing alien harvests. Different time lines = different vehicles.-----------I find this game was very well thought out. The harvesting wall alone adds very much to the story. (A shield boundary that you can't pass.) As you progress through the game you get newer weapons and vehicles of that time period. Its rewarding when you stumble across a tank and then in turn wreak havoc on all aliens that you come to. Planes,boats,bikes, firetrucks you name it this game has that vehicle.This game sounds great also. YOu can hear the rifle reverb, all vechicles sound different and it has very interesting mood music.This game is very interactive which is why I like it so much. As you beat bosses and levels you can wrap back any time you want. A simple touch is that you can turn on or off all candles,lanterns,torches and lights in the buildings. You have to pull switches block windmills and at one point, use a fire truck to put out a fire.Ripping through the jungle in your jeep.. OHHH sheeet. to fast. You ditch it into a pond. There is one less jeep you can drive.This game is an orginal game idea that always earns bonus points. And it was done very well.To sum it up. I like the levels, all the vechiles, the graphics of mutalating a alien with a maching gun on the tank. The puzzles aspect. Its great.Some people are just a little to tough on this game. It reminds me of starship troopers so much.A very worthy classic. 4 1/2",5,Solid Game,1038182400,"11 25, 2002",0.1123
3,A3MSO10BPAF01U,B00000IKQH,Freddy,"[0, 0]","I always wondered why I could never beat this game and as a 22 year old adult I figured it out...This game is hard! I will not post any spoilers but this game has done an awesome job with the technology available at the time of it's creation and GTA takes homage to it and based gameplay similarities off it. Anyway, there are not many games in today's day that makes games like this. It creates the atmosphere that you are under an imminent threat and you are never alone but at the same time it's only you that lies between a saved planet and destruction. If you haven't played this game but want to play older games, I would highly recommend this. If you are like me and haven't beaten this game..Give yourself that satisfaction and DO IT!",5,It's ok if you didn't beat this as a child..,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",0.3095

The game seem's to be more like an RPG game, And since I like RPG's I enjoyed the game a little bit. But, it's not really a game you'd want, To go back and Play.",3,Not My favorite game.,969321600,"09 19, 2000",0.374
5,A2WQY1B8ZS7QRZ,B00000IKQH,Mike Reed Mike Reed,"[3, 3]","This is my first review I've done of a video game. Body Harvest is a game that's very much fun to play. Although I read through the instruction booklet, this game SEEMS tough to figure out as to what to do next. It's almost like having your -own- Johnny Quest cartoon to play. Although you get just one life in your player (sort of a futuristic-like space warrior), you get plenty of chances to re-juice his power. The graphics, in MY opinion are good even though I've heard others quoting that they didn't care for them. Also enjoy the music that starts up whenever the aliens start coming in for the kill. An hour can easily pass by when you play Body Harvest. A good game to own.",4,Nintendo 64 - Body Harvest,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",0.2316
6,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00000IKQH,OverTheMoon,"[2, 4]","Body Harvest is like nothing you have played before. The idea is much like Blast Corps N64 and you actually harvest bodies in this game! The stages on each level where quite big and hard to complete. It is highly unique and addictive. Anyway this was the leading N64 I played in the Winter of 1998 by at which stage we where hearing that the old 1994 Playstation 1 was about to undergo a change. There was an important reason why I gave up buying more games on the N64 after the Winter of 1998 or the whole of 1999. I had been playing the N64 since the end of 1996 start of 1997. I got two solid great gaming years out of it, with the following two years spent playing the mutliplayer N64 we loved and owned.It would another few years before I would pick up a games console again.",5,The last great N64 game I played.

7,A1BQ318GESS864,B00000IKQH,Wired Wrong,"[0, 0]","Rockstar games later went on to use the game engine and flight mechanics as well as the swimming and other parts of his game to improve what most of you would refer to as GTA:SA and GTA:4, one could be labored to suggest that this game allowed and was the father of said games. In the gaming industry it happens often that one game either spawns or helps improve the industry standards and this game thou over looked did more for the gaming world then most figure or see.This game is to GTA, as Ultima Underworld is to Fallout 3, and that is to say they are the for runners that improved future games. I suggest if your looking for good harmless violence without human on human violence I recommend this one if you still use your N64. I would point out, that Human deaths that you allow or preform increase a ticking total and once you get to many you fail the level. So the game even goes so far as to not allow it, I will also add this game has one of the largest number of flying vehicles and ground vehicles and even boats and the likes of almost any game I have ever played in my entire life.",4,The Game Engine,1292371200,"12 15, 2010",0.3053
