It's basically about a dead warrior in a land of ghouls & zombies who attack him at every turn, & it is up to you to find the Chaos Rune, among other hidden treasures arrayed throughout this underworld of bizarre incarnations.The animations are up to 3-D par, although I will remark on the variety of different angles. The graphics are japanamistic, but nonetheless amusing.",4,Gravely entertaining...,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",0.1209
1,A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,B00000I1BK,Jaha,"[1, 1]",This game is interesting. My sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with. If you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it. The graphics are good and the control isn't too tricky. It does get difficult in parts but not overly. I am not a huge fan of platform games but this one got me with its unique humorous tones. Give it a shot on your PS2 if you haven't. It's a bargain.,4,A solid and fun game!,1043280000,"01 23, 2003",0.262
2,A2FPIG2WVZRRL6,B00000I1BK,Jean,"[1, 1]","This game has very good graphics for a PS game and the action and music.The game is very good and has 22 worlds,although they're short.What I dont like is that,you can only save when you pass a world,and thats bad because if you're doing perfect in the world but then you die,you'll have to do it all over again.The game has 4hands up and 1con,so I recommend it if you like zombie killing,horror action games.",5,great!,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",0.8844

So here I am sitting here on Amazon.com and figured well since my next stream is going to be for a Playstation game why not this first?MediEvil is a hack and slash game involving the undead, but unlike popular games that involves zombies in some way like Resident Evil this one is less....realistic. The game has a cartoon feel and the back of the box even says that, I usually love cartoons and this one fits the bill in terms of both comedy and graphics. The story is that there is this story teller for a king who kind of went off the deep end by saying he slain an evil wizard named Zarok. Zarok, who overhears this, decideds to declare war and horrified by this and believing in Fortesques (the story teller) story he sends him out to battle but Daniel goes down at the first shot with a welhelm scream and everything. 100 years later Zarok returns but so does Fortesque but this time the cowardly knight is a skeletal one.MediEvil's controls are a little awkward but once you get the hang of them it becomes quite nice, the atmosphere of this game is dark and gritty but not too much. As I said before the gameplay is a hack and slash type thing like God of War but less gory... much, much, much, much, MUCH less gory than that game and it does throw around puzzles. The game does beg for you to get every single chalice (collectables) by throwing in a lot of challenges that can make it easier to complete if you have a certain weapon such as enemies having an insane amount of health and would take literally forever to kill with your second to strongest sword. Because of this getting a 100% on this game is really easy and there is no bad ending for doing a No Chalice run if you so wish to do so.The music is outstanding and some of it is memorable, one of my favorite tracks is the ending theme of this one, the music is compose of a synthesizer and other normal instruments.So how would I rate this game, well I think this game is perfect and is and always on the number one spot of my top ten list of favorite games of all time. For that this game gets a 10/10 stars from me, music, gameplay, and graphics are always great and the controls are a bit awkward as I said but once you get used to it then this game is a blast. ALL HAIL SIR DANIEL FORTESQUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5,MediEvil,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",0.057

It's just that good.I wish someone would come out with an updated version for the Wii or later,b/c we'd def buy it!",5,Bring it back!,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",0.5216
