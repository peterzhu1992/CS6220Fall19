0,A9998RE3AEA95,B00000JNHJ,Alex,"[3, 5]","Ape Escape is on one of the sleekest action games on Playstation, which is, in theory, a pretty low-power console. The graphics, despite being rather choppy, are colorful and well-textured. Most of all, the game has a high frame rate with no noticeable slowdown to speak of, which allows things to move quickly and smoothly. The control scheme is intuitive despite being complex at the outset. Fortunately, no action you can take requires pressing more than one button. Right shoulder buttons are jumping, left shoulder buttons center camera and bring you into a first-person lookaround mode, digital d-pad moves the camera, left and right sticks move the character and the selected tool respectively, which the X, triangle, circle, and square buttons select your tool. Also, the controls are quite tight, which will save you much frustration from falling over cliffs and such. The camera is one of the best I've ever seen. It rarely swings around the character, although at times I did experience a few odd, glitchy perspectives, such as from behind walls and from under floors. Fortunately, the camera is spring-loaded to auto-center on the character.The level selection is the usual cliche pretty meadows/volcanoes/robotic factory fare, but in order to fulfill your quota of monkeys (capturing anachronistic, and very agile monkeys is the point of the game) you will have to navigate your surroundings in all of the three dimensions and utilize all of your equipment (monkeys are caught with a net, enemies are disposed of with a &quot;force club&quot;, you can glide with a hand copter to reach higher ground, or swim via help of a motorized sub), which is part of the appeal. The levels are large and complex.The game is relatively easy, but the frantic excitement it creates will make you play it over and over again.",4,A surprisingly good action game.,965001600,"07 31, 2000",0.2001

Looked like it was fun, and less stressful than some of my other games that I like tend to be, and borrowed her copy of the first Ape Escape.It starts out simple enough. You catch a few slow monkeys and learn your gadgets thru tutorials. But then it gets difficult. My 3 year old daughter loves to sit on the bed with spare control in hand and help catch monkeys. The graphics are nice and the storyline is fun. The gadgets are cool too.Only one complaint, and that is that the camera angle loves to change when you are at the most challenging parts. Anytime you need to use your flying thingy and it's for going somewhere difficult, the camera changes and you can't see where your destination is. It gets a bit annoying after you die a few times, but I did eventually get past the frustration and finished the game. This game is great for young kids and adults alike.",5,Too much fun,1071014400,"12 10, 2003",0.2124
2,A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B00000JNHJ,Antoinette Johnson Pooky,"[0, 0]","I used to play the h*** out of this game when I was little and even more when I got older. Its one of those game thats old, but never got boring even when I played it multiple times. For those who are new to the series, you might think its just running up to monkeys and catching them with a net. You're partially right. If you go into this game and try to catch every monkey by just running up to them with your net, you will get a game over fast. I own the other 2 games in the Ape Escape series and played them multiple times, so its safe for me to say that Ape Escape 1 is the hardest of the series. Let me go into a little more detail.A little background: I'm not sure about other consoles at the time, but the PS1, unlike todays Sony consoles, had a different control scheme. Instead of using the analogue sticks to move your camera and control your character, you used the arrow buttons. The analogue sticks didn't have much use. Actually with some games no use at all. In other games like Spyro the Dragon you had the option to turn them on, but for some of those games it was glitchy. Ape Escape prooved revolutionary in that it was the first PS1 game to solely use analogue controls and I'm happy it did. I think Ape Escape is the best moving ps1 game I have ever played due to analogue controls. It makes controlling your character and changing camera angles way easier than most games at the time. Now all games use this control scheme for the better.Story summary: 2 boys, Spike and Jake, are heading to the Professor's laboritory to try out his time machine, but once they get there they find the professor and his assistant/granddaughter Natalie tied up by a horde of monkeys. The monkeys leader (Spector) has gotten hold of one of the professors inventions called the peak point helmet which increases Spectors intellegents and helps him achieve an insane level of power. The other monkeys possess Monkey helmets that do pretty much the same thing as Spectors helmet, but less powerful. Spctor sends himself and the other monkeys through time so they can change history in a way that'll make monkeys the dominant creatures of the earth and humans basically nonexistant. Its up to Spike to capture these monkeys, including Spector. I know its not the deepest story, but its really amusing and fun getting to travel through time through the dinosaur age up to the future. Later on in the game I actually found it compelling. You also really grow to love Spike by the time you finish the game. I understand now, why alot of people who play the sequals wish Spike was the main character again.Gameplay elements and monkeys: Once again you catch monkeys, but its easier said than done. The first 3 levels are pretty easy, but by level 4 you will be introducesd by some of the harder and more hair pulling to catch monkeys in the game. The task of catching the monkeys is made harder by the fact that you have natural level enemies to worry about while chasing the monkeys down, like Man eating plants and annoying bees. I also have to mention that alot of monkeys are PACKING HEAT! Laser guns, bombs, machine gun, HOLLYCOW! Don't get me started on the red pants monkeys later on who carry almost all these weapons as well as have extremely powerful scratch attacks that you can rarely avoid. There are different kinds of monkeys. I'll just summarize what they do. Monkeys with light blue pants are wimpy and easy to catch. Monkeys with dark blue pants are fast little monsters and require patients to get. Yellow pants monkeys are the most common and have normal difficulty. Green pant monkeys carry missiles on their back and require stealth to get because their sensitive to movement. White pants monkeys sense you easilly and are hard to sneak up on (understatement. Impossible unless someone says other wise). Black pant monkeys carry oozies/machine guns. I have to note the black pant monkeys are way harder to catch than the ones in the newer games. Then you have the abominations called red pant monkeys. Good lord do my heart stop when I have to catch one of these little bastards. Catching monkeys takes alot of patients and strategy because as you've already guessed from my description of them, they are hard to catch. Throughout the game you are given multiple inventions from the professor that are essential to catching certain monkeys in earlier levels that couldn't be caught before. Every invention is important in some shape or form and will either make a monkey easier to catch or harder, depending on the strategy used. The inventions are way better than the ones they give you in the other games. Some of the inventions in the other games are just plain useless. You also have lives in this game that you gain by collecting 100 gold arrows or a jacket. I've had more game overs in this one then any of the other two.Levels: The levels are divided by eras (the whole travel through time element). For example: Im in the dinosaur era and I play 3 levels from this era one after the other (unlock them), catch the required number of monkeys, then leave, unlocking a new era with 3 more levels (Hope that explains it good). Each level is unique and different which makes everything feel fresh and that much more awesome.Music: OMG! Ape Escape has one of my favorite videogame soundtracks of all time. Not since Donkey Kong Country 2 have I entered levels just to pause and listen to the music. Ape Escape prooves music is a very important part of a videogame. The music excites you and is very enjoyable. It has the best track of the entire series and its ashame Ape Escape 2 suffers from its bland soundtrack. In Ape Escape 3 the music is reminiscent of the first one, so I think the makers learned from their mistake. My favorite tracks are Crumbling Castle, Dark Ruins, Galaxy Monkey, The Spector theme, and a few others, but the soundtrack of the whole game is just epic and fills my heart with nostalgia and joy everytime I hear one of them. It's underrated and I wish more people knew about it.Replayabillity: Compared to the other games, Ape Escape 1 doesn't have much replayabilty, unless you're like me and love it so much you just start a new game all the time. Throughout the levels there are Spector coins you pick up. the coins are used to unlock 3 minigames in the time station. My favorite of these is galaxy monkey. The other two are meh. I really wish they had a way for you to unlock the soundtrack like the other two games. That would have been awesome.I've gone down memory lane long enough. The sad part is I still have my old Ape Escape game, but it no longer works anymore. I'm definately buying it off amazon. I wish instead of porting Ape Escape to the PSP, they would have ported it to the PS2, with an soundtrack unlockable available. Given that attention is mostly put on the PS3 and other next gen consoles/games nowadays I don't see a port happening soon (the PS3 doesn't even play older games according to some people I've asked). Ape Escape is definately worth buying.",5,One of my favorite games of all time.,1309910400,"07 6, 2011",0.1956

The monkeys wear different colored pants, and have little sirens on their heads. The pants tell you how tough they are to catch, and the sirens tell you if they've caught on to the fact that you're trying to capture them.In addition to the trusty tools I mentioned above, you get a whole slew of other gadgets you can use to capture the monkeys, including an r/c car, slingshot and monkey radar. Unfortunately, the monkeys are also armed with everything from grenades to machine guns to canons.In addition to being hilarious (the commercials for the game were great, if you got a chance to seem them on TV), the joy of the game is using the analog controllers to move and manipulate gadgets.The game was the perfect difficulty, not too hard as I had suspected it would be.

To clear a level, Spike (played by you) must capture a set number of monkeys. After filling that quota, you must access the next level. Reaching the monkeys will require you to jump, sneak, swim, climb and fly through a variety of situations. To help you on your way, you are given a net and a lightsaber type stun club. Throughout the course of the game, Spike will collect six additional gadgets. In addition to providing the means of completing future levels, returning to previous levels with new gadgets will allow Spike to capture any monkeys he left behind.

The object of the game is to catch all the monkeys lose in each level. Trust me, it isn't as easy as you might think. It takes some smarts to get them lil critters.

12,AD7IBJCYSJ9EE,B00000JNHJ,Destitute,"[0, 0]","Ah, the year was 1999. While Sony and Nintendo were clashing, people thought that 2000 would be the end or at least the end of their computers. SpongeBob SquarePants began to reign to over kids, along with Pokemon. And some people were wondering why their Ape Escape game wouldn't work as they threw their non-Dualshock controllers down on the floor, while I was hating the game for not knowing how to play it. However, when I got it together, it became one of my favorites until its demise in 2008, when, wanting to make an ISO of my aging disc, I found it with a huge crack on it, under unknown circumstances.So, now that I've got a little of my nostalgia out, onto my review of this unique little game.GRAPHICS: Blocky, polygonal, and furthermore, colorful. In other words, it is the typical PS1 game. Nothing like a PS3's, but who cares?MUSIC: A big kudos to the people who composed to the music, because even after ten years it is still fun to listen to. Catchy, synth-like riffs fill this level, each level having a unique soundtrack. What's also cool is when you crouch, some of the instruments cease.SOUND/VOICE ACTING: The sounds, while sort of primitive, are also catchy. The swoosh of the net will be music to your ears, along with the footsteps and other stuff. The voice acting, while so-so, is actually the best voice acting in the trilogy. I wish the cast would have stayed for 2 and 3, but oh well.STORY: Simple, but pretty original. Specter, the most popular monkey in the monkey amusement park, finds the Professor's Peak Point Helmet, which enhances intelligence. Once he puts it on, he wants revenge for being locked up in there, so he makes more, gives them to all the monkeys in the park, and he raids the Professor's lab to use his time machine to rewrite history so apes can rule the world. Now only Spike, who kind of looks like Yu-Gi-Oh, can capture the monkeys, defeat Specter, and save his friend, Jake, who is under Specter's control.GAMEPLAY: Now here's where the game truly shines. Before I talk about the actual gameplay, however, let me discuss the controls.The Dualshock controller had been out for a while, but was still unneeded to enjoy the game. All it provided was vibration, and the ability to play with the analogue stick, the right stick as useful as wisdom teeth. Then Ape Escape came along and changed everything. Those without DS controllers had to get some to enjoy this game, whilst many tried to figure out the layout. The directional pads were only used for the camera, while the triangle, square, cross, and circle buttons were just used to change gadgets. It was then where the right stick, the L3, and the R3, (the latter both not having a title yet. It was just `push the left/right stick down like a button,) finally got their chance. This paved way for more functions for the Playstation controller.As for the gameplay itself, it is a blast, even if it's your 10th play. You time travel to many eras, your mission being to catch the apes. You also got gadgets, which help you solve puzzles and catch some out of reach monkeys. You start off with a stun club and a net, but you later get a total of nine gadgets, each having their unique function. The apes themselves are diverse, with each color of pants they wear representing their abilities. Some move so fast that you must catch them via stealth. After all, this was made a year after Metal Gear Solid came out. You don't have to catch all the monkeys in the level (some you can't until later when you got a different gadget,) but if you do, you can play the level with a time trial, which gives you nothing, but is fun. You also need to catch every single ape if you want to catch Specter. Your health is represented by cookies. You can also get Specter Coins, which allow you to play three different mini-games once you get the required amount. There's a skiing game, a boxing game, and a space shooter game, the last one the best IMO. There are also two racing levels where you race the brainwashed Jake for Specter coins.As for bosses, there are none until you get to Crumbling Castle. It's a shame, because the bosses are fun to fight. Instead, the game relies on enemies to keep you at bay besides the apes. You can't kill the apes, but you can kill the enemies and get goods. You'll have to search everywhere for those damn dirty apes, from the ocean to the Ice Age to even inside a dinosaur.Ape Escape, overall, is quite a fun game. It's not too hard, but it's still entertaining. This is a must buy. They also remade this game for PSP, but I never tried it. But I think AE is best on the big screen with a controller.",5,This review is deditcated to my Ape Escape disc. 1999-2008,1231113600,"01 5, 2009",0.2096

Not to mention that I loved Super Mario 64, but, since I didn't own an N64, I was forced to play it only when I visited my cousin's.One day, while browsing my local Blockbuster, my sister saw a cover with monkeys on it. With that and Rugrats, she checked out the counter with my selections, and we went home that day to play games. I don't remember what games I checked out (FFIX?), but Ape Escape was the one title we played together until we had to return it.Her following birthday, I bought it for her.

You get helpful gadgetry along the way, and they're all extremely useful and you'll find yourself using them all to the very end. Sometimes some games give you arsenals that become obsolete a few levels later; not here. Every level can use all your tools.The boss fights are sparse, but the final boss more than makes up for it. It remains one of my most favorite boss battles, though, by today's standards, it's pretty easy.I write this review only a couple weeks after my latest playthrough, and the game still holds up extremely well. I thought that, with my years of gaming experience, catching the monkeys would be a lot easier. While I know most of the game's secrets, and the easier levels were far easier than before, the monkeys still prove a challenge to capture.

Since my game play style tends towards using the analog controller whenever I can, this game seems to be custom made for myself. And of course it is. It's a pretty neat concept having the monkeys (I don't think the manual writer did a lot of research on monkeys since the book uses &quot;baboons,&quot; &quot;apes,&quot; and &quot; chimps&quot; interchangeably) escape from the zoo and having your job to chase down and capture them. Nice non violent plot really, one of the very few games that I buy and my girlfriend is willing to play.And while the game has a nice plot, the programmers also spent a little time on the graphics in the game. Since the PSX is showing its age there is only so much any programmer can do. But the programers did a very good job. The smooth graphics, &quot;large&quot; worlds and a grand variety of scenes make this game a delight to explore (Never mind the obvious use of some of Sony's stock SDK files, usually evident by the &quot;Pa Rappa&quot; look in some areas). Throw in a huge variety of weapons and usable &quot;tools&quot; make this a winning formula indeed. In fact it is likely that after the PSX goes the way of the Atari 7800 that this game will be one of the reasons that die hard fans of the PSX will dust off that gray box (Or blue if they upgrade to the PSX2) and play a few levels. However, I have one major gripe.It shocks me that many people consider the Ape Escape camera to be nice and well behaved. This camera is one of the most ill-behaved I've come across in a long time. Just what are some people comparing this camera to? Super Mario 64? If that's the case, then that's a hard judge. SM64's camera was pretty bad but at least it was aware of walls and didn't go behind them too often. Ape Escape's camera not only goes behind walls but it goes through them as well! Haven't the programmers at least heard of a &quot;Jelly Cam&quot;? C'Mon, there are numerous examples out there of what to do and what not to do with the camera. Ones with decent (mind you, decent, not perfect) camera's include Spyro 2, MDK 2, and Zelda 64. All of these games had cameras that were somewhat well behaved (although none show the classic &quot;Jelly Cam,&quot; A Jelly Cam is a camera that when it goes through a wall turns the wall, or anything else, into a semitransparent entity. You know it's there but at least you can see what's going on on the other side.) AE does not fall into that category. I can't tell you how many times I've run back and forth in a level looking for a way out only to discover the camera wasn't &quot;swinging&quot; in an appropriate direction. Some pundits may tell you that only adds to the difficulty of the game. Someone should remind them of the difference between skilled difficulty and annoying frustration. Never, Never should any one ever lose a life because the camera wasn't doing a good job of showing what is happening around you. &quot;How about blind spots?&quot; Some may ask. What about them? It is very possible to design a game and camera to allow the classic &quot;leap of fate.&quot; My gripe lies with the camera refusing to shift at appropriate times so that I can at least survive the darn jump! Or Shifting to an appropriate angle to allow a fair fight against a baddie. All to often I'm getting pummeled by a monkey with a machine gun or rockets simply because the stupid camera doesn't know enough to swing around a column. And using buttons to &quot;fix&quot; the camera's faults is a cheap trick. Sorry Sony, A big company like your self should know better.This game gets three stars due the rotten camera work. If the programmers spent more time with this crucial element then the game would certainly win five stars. Too bad Sony, the frustration with the camera is simply too high. For those who think the camera works &quot;perfect&quot; play a few more games for comparison.",3,I'd like to shoot the &quot;camera man&quot;,971049600,"10 9, 2000",0.0146
