If you grab three friends and play, there is no better feeling in the world. Play, what seems like endless mini-games, with either Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool (a.k.a. Peach), Wario, DK, and (my personel favorite) Yoshi! Believe me, this is a good deal for such a good game!",5,Fun for the whole family!,988675200,"05 1, 2001",0.5166
1,A2AV2TR28DGSGC,B00000IFRI,ajnrules ajnrules,"[0, 0]","Yeah. So the story is very weak. Things are often like that for multiplayer-centered games. At least Mario Party had actually TRIED to spice things up with a story. Where's the story for Super Smash Bros.? Where's the story for Mario Kart 64? I didn't think so. As weak as the Mario Party story is, the story isn't important for a game...the gameplay is. Some games with great stories have fallen flat because of poor gameplay. Other games with NO story succeed with great gameplay. Mario Party is definitely in the latter category. You can hate the Mario Party series for its excellent Land Before Time impression. You can be among the groups of people that prefer Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3. Yet there is one thing that you must admit. Mario Party was DARNED fun back in 1999! Sure, people said to NEVER play with one person, but playing all four characters as one person can be a blast as well.Anticipation may have been the first board-game video game for Nintendo, but it wasn't exactly successful, and had relatively primative gameplay. So people now associate Mario Party with the introduction of board-game video game, and it's definitely more like a board game than any other game before it. I mean, you roll a dice and move around the board encountering various pitfalls and experiencing different events. Although most of the boards are well-designed, I have realized that the majority of the board-game aspect is text or movement, and somebody watching a tape with only footage the board-game aspect would likely get very bored very fast. But what makes Mario Party the gem that it is are...the mini-games! Yes, Mario Party has 56 mini games to entertain all souls from all walks of life. Sure, not all mini-games are perfect, but you know what? Even with all of the blisters, broken glasses, and white powder appearing on the N64 controller, the mini-games are still worth it! Especially Mushroom Mix-Up and Running of the Bulb. Oh yeah. Those are great games. Mushroom Mix-Up provided tons of frantic fun and Running of the Bulb was hectic but exciting. 4-player teamwork games really need to make a comeback.Being a title developed by a third party (yes, Hudson is a 3rd party developer), the graphics in Mario Party are not exactly polished. Most of the textures are just simple polygons. And as was stated, the water is in the Bombs Away game is extremely pixelated. These graphics are not the ones that are so grand that you can't help but go Uah, but why bother with visual aesthetics when the game is already filled with gameplay finesse. At least the graphics don't hurt your eyes. I can't say that about a game that game out 3-4 months after Mario Party...I'm sure you all know what it is. Sound. Sound effects are amusing, but not exactly something special. Voice acting is good, but I finally found out (after five years) that much of the voice samples were lifted directly from the Japanese version of Mario Kart 64. The music? It is fantastic! There's a hint of Super Mario Bros. mixed in with the rest. It's great to listen to, even if it is all just MIDIs. Okay, a lot of this is probably due to nostalgia. I can write a paper on nostalgia and Mario Party, but I'll leave it at this. The bottom line is, even though Mario Party isn't one of the technologically advanced games on the N64, it sure makes up for it with its incredible gameplay.",5,The Best Game of 1999!,1103241600,"12 17, 2004",0.2512

You hit blocks to determine the number of spaces you move and earn or lose things depending on the space you land on. Then, at the end of each turn you play a mini game. There are other fun things to do, like play in the mini-game stadium, shop for new games and play individually to earn prizes. However, one major downer? The rotating hand games. Play this game enough and games like &quot;Cast Aways&quot; the one with the light bulb, and the 1 vs 3 riverboat game will cause blisters in your hand!If you like this one then check out the 2nd one as well for more options, new board games and mini-games as well as new gameplay features.

10,A182VTJIIEVM37,B00000IFRI,GintaxAlvissforever,"[1, 1]","I'll be doing the Mario Party games next and besides this one and 9, I have the entire series. 1 is the first one I played and still the one I hold very highly as one of the best ones in the series.The plot is very generic. Toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin. The original Mario Party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck. I might even add that some mini games like the tug-o-war required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand. Yeah some of the mini-games are brutal. On the plus side, there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didn't see that until Mario Party 9 with the boss battle.The game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the character's personalities through the stages. This game kind of set up Peach's obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers. The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle. I love how whoever gets 4th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while 1st player achieves the mission needed.Overall, a good start for the series, but good luck finding this game. This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high prices.",4,Mario Party Started it All in This (Hard) Party Game,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",0.3508

12,A3E0SWGYTWFGP9,B00000IFRI,James,"[0, 0]","The original Mario Party is a must, as previous mentioned in the title, for any retro gamer and collector of classics. Those of you who have played Mario Party 8 or 9 for the Wii can now see the humble beginnings of this popular series of hit family games.Unlike Mario Party 8, there is a somewhat more interesting storyline where the six most famous characters of the Mushroom Kingdom (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, DK, and Wario) are arguing over who could be the Super Star. After a rather amusing argument sequence, the six are placated by Toad to play a variety of games in order to achieve good deeds and become the Super Star.When held in comparison of the boards of Mario Party 8 and 9 for the Wii, the boards of Mario Party 1 are still holding up well. Naturally, the graphics are incredibly dated, but the design is a tad more intricate and focuses on gameplay instead of the visual style. The rules are the same for each board also:- You and three other players move around the board in a predetermined amount of turns- Play addictive and fun mini-games- Collect coins and (hopefully) a star or two- Try not to run into Bowser who will cause nothing more but trouble and steal your money or stars- And after each amount of turns play out, you get a cool little cinema of victory if you win.While I consider Mario Party 8 visually better and more entertaining, this game is still a classic and not just because it started the Mario Party craze. I love this game because the music is very cool compared to the strange pieces played in 8 and the controls are much more easier to use than the erratic unpredictability of the Wii-Remotes. All in all, a solid purchase.",5,A must for any retro gamer and collector of classics,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",0.6889

When this game first came out, it seemed to be the only thing people talked about. Yet today, with 5 Mario Parties in the collection, this one still is wonderful for being the base roots.Just like any of the other Mario Parties, you choose which character you'd like to be, Mario, Luigi, ect. The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars. Stars come at a price, 20 coins. To get 20 coins, you must win mini games or land on blue spots. This is like an advanced board game for the N64, but with a twist. In addition to the board game aspect of this game, after everyone takes 1 turn a mini game takes place.Competitions in this mini game include:Everyone against eachother1 Vs 32 Vs 2This is where the intense fun comes on. You and your friends button smash, spin the analog stick to your hearts content. As a matter of fact, so much button smashing (fast taps on the buttons)takes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand. Be warned, if you're too competitive with this particular Mario Party, you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers.It's overall pure fun. Games can last for hours and hours if you really want. Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull, this game completely opposite of that!If you want a great N64 game...this is a must buy.If you are interested in this game, but don't want to play an older console anymore or don't have a N64, I recommend Mario Party 4 and 5 for the Nintendo Gamecube.

It became so big, that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement, and so on down the line.With Mario Party for Nintendo 64, they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become. The game features your choice of six characters to choose from, Wario, Mario, Peach a.k.a. Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Luigi, and Donkey Kong. The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug O' War, where it is 1 player vs. 3 players, Bombs Away, where you have to try stay on a floating island for 30 seconds, without getting the shock from cannon shots coming, and there is Deep Sea Divers, where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible, without losing your breath. There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on, as well as two very special hidden boards, so look out.It is a shame that most games didn't seem to be like Mario Party.

17,ADUDTHE4Q6832,B00000IFRI,NintendoSonyGamer,"[0, 1]","Presentation:Back in the day Nintendo wanted another fun multiplayer game to create that doesn't exactly involve racing and thus the first of many Mario Party games was created. Let's see how they did in this new evolution to one of the most influential franchises in gaming.Gameplay:This was one of the first Nintendo games to include 4 player multiplayer and boy did people love this! Basically this game is like a board game, you start off with 10 coins and you roll a dice to determine where you go depending on the spaces you land on you can have fortunate things happen to you, unfortunate things, or you can end up gaining or losing coins. At the end of each turn the 4 players compete in a mini-game where the winner has a chance to win 10 coins. You want coins so you can have enough to buy a Star from Toad or maybe even have Boo steal one for you. When you've made a whole lap around the board depending on the time of the game Koopa Troopa will give you neither 10 or 20 coins. After 20-50 turns when the game ends youhave a chance to win bonus stars, the person with the most stars after that wins! The gameplay is a lot of fun whether you are playing alone or with friends. 9/10Music and Sound Effects:The music is very catchy to listen to, and the sound effects are good for the most part. The voice acting however is hilarious, nothing like hearing Wario yell DOH! I MISSED!!. 8/10Story:The story is for the most part an amateur story. However most Mario games are, Mario and his friends one day argue about who is the best and they decide to find out who is through multiple games of Mario Party. In the meantime Bowser trys to cause trouble for the characters and they end up eventually defeating him at his volcano. Angered by this he tries to defeat them again in space, luring them there by stealing their stars. They once again defeat Bowser, and the winner of that game is declared the Superstar. The default winner of the game is Wario. 6/10Overall:Mario Party is a great single player and multiplayer game. And can be enjoyed by anyone of any age though the game is out of date I find this to be one of the best of the Mario Party series.

After each turn, you play a minigame. At the end of the minigame, the winner(s) get coins. The coins can then be used to buy stars from Toad.

However, there is a major problem with the controls...As you may have heard, there are minigames in Mario Party that require rotating the control stick. Doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand. In fact, Nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of Mario Party. But instead, Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Party's instruction manual.I realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game. Specifically, the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box. In this case, how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that Nintendo was looking for? Nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves. A way that would allow anyone who has the game, and cannot keep track of everything, get there hands on, or in, a glove.Nintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing Mario Party.
