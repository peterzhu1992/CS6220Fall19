1,A2AV2TR28DGSGC,B00000JHPD,ajnrules ajnrules,"[6, 7]","Over the years, there has been many video game systems, starting from the Atari in the early 1980s to the Playstation 2 in the early 2000s. Each one has a unique controller. The early ones, such as NES and Super NES are awkward. Same with the Playstation, Playstation 2, and the Dreamcast. But when we come to the Nintendo 64 controller, we find something completely different. The designers seem to have gotten the shape just right so that your hands can fit comfortably in the best position to play games, with each button placed at the most convenient places so you don't have to reach for them. And unlike the old controllers, your hands aren't cramped so the only pain you feel is if you're playing Mario Party without the gloves.And black is just a cool color.Alas, my controller has been the victim of my frustrations, so I would need a new one,",5,The best controller of them all!,975283200,"11 27, 2000",0.139

5,A2GBBDNZLYC4A9,B00000JHPD,Jeff Johnson Jeff Johnson,"[1, 6]","I live in a neighborhood with around 30 children in it, that all play Nintendo. I love Nintendo to no end but these controllers break easily! That is why so many colors and versions of them are sold! The buttons break easily where they no longer work when pressed, especially the L and R buttons, the directional pad also breaks easily where you press up on the pad and it moves left or you press down and it moves left. Because of the handlebars on the side of the controller, that allows the plastic bends quite easily. I have noticed when children get upset or frustrated with a game they twist those handle bars, causing them to break, bend or crack. However a controller is a controller, but for this price you can find something cheaper that is more sturdy and reliable.",3,"Not the best price, nor construction",998784000,"08 26, 2001",0.2067
