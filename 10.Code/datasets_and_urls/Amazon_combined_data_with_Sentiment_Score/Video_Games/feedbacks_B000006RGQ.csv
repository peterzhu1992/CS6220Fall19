Though only a little worse than Charlie's Angels (GameCube) and not as bad as Hidden Invasion (PlayStation2), Fighting Force is the difinitive bad adventure-fighting game that fits on the same crap list as Burning Fight. Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this, and that's saying a lot.You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters: pixie-pig-tailed Alana, gruff Hawk, leather-pants-wearing Look at me, I'm Nabiki Tendo Mace, and prison inmate Smasher. They're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen. Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world.Many Sega Saturn owners didn't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system. Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky, and I wasn't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version.The controls are sloppy, the hit detection is horrible, especially the dash attacks, and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon.If there is one redeeming factor, it is the music. Though not great, the musical scores in this game are a nice touch. The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear, if anything, is an annoying buzz. Start on Track 2, sit back, and enjoy the only good thing about this game.",2,Pretty awful,1144886400,"04 13, 2006",-0.2076
3,ASHK9LB9MU5ZI,B000006RGQ,isams,"[0, 0]","This game is very fun. I have only played a demo that my cousin has but I'm dying to pick up a copy. The demo is short and we like to come up with different themes to it like we're going to a party at the building at the end of the demo. This game is kind of funny. Some of the enemies are pure fools. I like to run around the van with them chasing. Then I turn around and and knock the crud out of them. I like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies. That's pretty funny too. The characters have awesome moves. I love fighting games and this is one of my favorites. If you like fighting games and games that are just plain fun, buy this game.",5,Fighting fun!,999561600,"09 4, 2001",0.2963

5,AFNCXMCX7VZWH,B000006RGQ,J. Jongeling slice of heaven,"[0, 0]","Fighting Force was the wanna-be Streets Of Rage for PlayStation. If you grew up in the 90's and owned a Sega you'll know what I'm talking about. The game had tons of flaws such as the lo-fidelity sound effects (sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm) and the blocky PC-like design of the characters. Heck, it looked like a Windows 95 platform game.There are four characters to choose from : two chicks, a big giant and the handsome one. They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings. Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too; but he's slow as a mule. Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits. Alana and Mace are both quick (alana moreso) but are weak and fragile.The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the game's engine. Back then, games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly. The load times on this game tell you there's a lot of extra space here. An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemies/items on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players' controllers (remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an 'air grab' 1 second after you press the button?). This resulted in getting beat up from 5 or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head. Not fun. Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first. Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and you're spinning through the air. Fun! Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot. And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face.You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it. The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though I've learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way. The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue (which, by the way starts you over on the level...totally bogus!). When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming. You'll see what I mean when you finish it.All in all, despite its obvious and frustrating flaws, the game is still a classic. If you don't own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time. Re-live the polygonal loading-screen glory!!",4,"Despite its flaws, it is a classic",1363910400,"03 22, 2013",-0.0948

7,ACMO0RPLWYRHV,B000006RGQ,Remy,"[0, 1]","Alrighty, let me just start off by saying don't let people who play Final Fantsay 7 sway your judgement about this. While Final Fantsay 7 is an amazing game, it varies VERY HEAVILY from Fighting Force, so what some people like (fun fighting games)and others love (RPG gamers) we are at war with the worlds. It's better to agree to disagree here. Okay, let us begin with the review. I love this game. From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character (Mace Daniels is my personal favorite), to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy. It is ingenius. I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really snazzy throws/blocks. Like people have said, it is like a Streets of Rage for the now. Let me break it down overall for you:Graphics- Compared to now, it is not up to bar. Compare it to when it frist came out, bar none! 5/5, although the animation can sometime slow down.Sound- Ain't nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch! 5/5Control- Obviously this is the black-sheep of the family. The controls are clunky and choppy, and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience. Thank God for infinite health codes! 3/5 (ouch)Overall- Aside from the controls being what they are, the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beat-'em-up. I feel this game is totally undercredited, and that we need to change that. ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES!",5,"C'mon people, play nice. Screw nicities!",1097107200,"10 7, 2004",0.2309
