I'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts. It was either too dark so you didn't know where the character was going or you couldn't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys. Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well, it was hard to locate where you were going, unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City. Unfortunately, the writers expected us to know as well.",1,A terrible injustice to a longstanding icon.,1039046400,"12 5, 2002",0.0158

I've looked in a quiz, and two Italian plumbers (Mario and Luigi) both relate to this game. Besides, Mediocre is 10% better than poor.",3,IT'S NOT THAT BAD,1081641600,"04 11, 2004",-0.0444
3,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B000006OWR,J. Paul John doe,"[0, 0]",Yes I'll review Batman & Robin to the Playstation and why couldn't have been like Batman Forever arcade. It's wrose than Batman Forever on SNES and Genesis. I don't know which is wrose this game or the Joel Schumacer film. Becuse I don't know what to do after I get the diamond. I know what I'm getting with the film a very bad one. Just leave them both alone.,1,Do I have to review this crap,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",-0.065

Batman Forever on Genesis was better then this dud,and we all know how bad that game was.I HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT buy this.The ONLY reason why you MIGHT wanna purchase this,is because it's a pretty rare game,and it could be a part of your game collection,but as far as the game itself goes....IT SUCKS!",1,Just as bad as the movie,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",-0.2343
