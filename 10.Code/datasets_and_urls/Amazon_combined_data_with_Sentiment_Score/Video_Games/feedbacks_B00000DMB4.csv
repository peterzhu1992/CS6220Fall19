1,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000DMB4,B. E Jackson,"[0, 13]","Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good. I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago. Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara's pretty face. Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin' market. The thing is, the games are boring and Lara Croft isn't very pretty.If polygon-breasted girls are your thing, go for it. But they aren't MY thing, and I know I'm not the only one to think so. Lara Croft isn't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe isn't going to automatically make a game any fun to play. I'll give Lara Croft SOME credit. She was one of the originators of the running around half-naked female shooter/adventure type of video games. In fact, you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure, more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks. Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.Sometimes influence doesn't matter when a game is really bad. This is one of those cases. The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke. I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are, the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games, the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft (which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game. Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to) and of course, mentioned above, Lara's supposed beautiful face (she's NOT pretty, remember?)It also doesn't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful (and appear frequently) and, because of the jumping problem, very frustrating to complete. Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isn't exactly a walk in the park, either. The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series. Now, these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games, but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically*, making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels. I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara's pretty face ALONE isn't going to get the job done anymore. I mean, at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good . Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course, and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight. But what's THERE is okay to look at, at least.Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem. She simply doesn't jump the way you want her to. You'd THINK the game company would've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game, but no, none of these new moves make the game any easier. The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games (all these years I've been watching OTHER people play them). Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2, I see NO improvements have been made. Let the series END already.",1,spend your money elsewhere,1154476800,"08 2, 2006",-0.0295

The levels consist of timed events e.g. flip a switch and run to the other end of the level before a door closes.The graphics are good as is the music. The story is non-existent though.

3,A29Z0OKLTIZ7MN,B00000DMB4,crude101,"[0, 1]","I own a playstation but i hardly think it's that great a console. Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it.Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals, then you won't be dissappointed either.You also get to blow uo raptors and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or Sonic a run for their money.Simply put, all the TR games are long and filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not gonna be what i'm looking for long-term.It's also tedious to have to play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds extreme.But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games.If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised; Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit nicely.Finally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at times.But given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.",4,Lara's the One (on the Playstation),966297600,"08 15, 2000",0.5515

E.g., there's a particular spot at the very outset of the game, hiding under the leaves, which you have to make a blind leap to find, and would never guess is there if someone hadn't told you. But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure -- the one point remainder (a postage stamp, usually, in the old days, or dropping the magazine in a particular place when you're at your wit's end). The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life, and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer. Very legitimate. Same as, Don't kill monks at Barkhang Monastery (TR2), and don't kill monkeys either (TR3)! This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay. It's full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR2, and I enjoy everything about it ... except playing. The game part is tedious, unfair and annoying beyond belief. But it's a real collector's item, especially on PlayStation 2 (be sure to keep your PS1 memory card!), and in our family, it's in its second generation of total immersion.",4,"Not difficult, impossible.

In this game you start out in india or something, then you have a choice between Nevada, London, Or some other rainforest. You end up doing them all eventually but you pick the order. You then finish up by going to Antarctica. The story line is something like Lara is trying to find a meteor or something that killed everybody along time ago or something like that. The controls are very shaky but after a while you get used to them. The best part of the game is deffinately her house. This is the training level. If you want tips on how to skip levels and get the key in her house to the four wheeler, e-mail me at Lazyboy112@adelphia.net . I have a bunch of codes.

8,A14T4WS6YCLETD,B00000DMB4,Olivia Virna,"[2, 3]","Tomb Raider 3 was by far the most difficult Tomb Raider I have ever played. I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire Story So far...&quot; feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels.Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!!Yippee.Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck!But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3.If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize &quot;L2, R2, L2(2), R2, L2, R2, L2, R2, L2(4), R2, L2, R2(4), L2&quot; if you want to beat this game!",3,TOO HARD,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",0.066

10,AK1OBVI54SY73,B00000DMB4,Rocky Raquel,"[0, 0]","For a few reasons new people of the Tomb Raider games should not start out on this one, unless they are really skilled at video games. Seriously I beat Tomb Raider One and Two and even Four with a heck of a lot more ease than I did with part Three. So no I would not recommend this to new gamers but people that want a challenge this is the game to get.One of the biggest reasons this game is so hard are the secrets. They sometimes put the secrets in places you would never even notice. So I advise, if you want the secret level at the end of this game, to get a strategy guide cause 99% of the time you cannot find all the secrets on your own. The secret level though is not neccessary to beat the game at the end, and not truly worth the bother to me. I was so happy and exhausted to just finally beat the game that I could have cared less about a secret level and wouldn't have wanted to play it anyway.And that was another problem. How hard the ultimate boss at the end was. I thought the dragon in part two was difficult- at least when it hit me I didn't automatically lose. With the ultimate boss in part three if you get too close he will spew this stuff at you and right away you drop dead. It was difficult and frustrating and took me forever to beat. Yet I cannot say it is impossible, for I did at last beat it, but it is NEARLY impossible and will take you most likely a long while like I. What I did was the best, I got out my rocket launcher and just kept blowing away at him while jumping around and around that platform. I definitely would not stand there or get too close make sure you are as far away as possible for he will not spew that stuff at you unless you are close.Then I guess the next hardest part of part three was just the levels themselves. Some parts of the game were very difficult and without the strategy guide next to me I would have encountered many, many dead ends or stepped into a place that just ended Lara. It grew pretty frustrating at times and the worst part of it all is that you cannot save anytime you like- so unless you cheat and get a load of crystals you will do some backtracking.Worst part of the game:Nevada- In this part all the medi packs you saved up, all the ammo you saved up before- the guards take it all away from you so you have to go through the levels finding your guns and picking up as many medi packs as you can. It grew to be very difficult and I hated that part of the game. The only good part of this level was at the very end when you got to see a few alien bodies.Best parts of the game:South America- For its lovely scenes and it wasn't impossible to beat. I also liked the dinosaurs they put in, it reminded me of Tomb Raider One all over again.And London- London was fun as well I enjoyed playing there, with what looked like the same Sphinx- like statue placed in this part as was in Tomb Raider One, except this time you don't go into this one.So- So Levels:India- Sometimes a challenge that got on my nerves but then the rest of the time it was just normal Tomb Raider stuff, a little boring of a level compared to the others. The statues coming alive were pretty scary though.Anartica- Creepy part of the game. At the ending part of all Tomb Raider games there is some breed of creatures you have to fight- in part one it was what looked like animals turned inside out- in part two she fought what looked like action figures- and now in part three she has to fight mutants. Creepy definitely. Got a little scary sometimes. And this part of the game was not too hard, but indeed I was always kept on alert with those mutants. One problem I hated in this part though was the carts- those mine carts drove me crazy I was always dying in them. Just keep working at it though, eventually you get around those corners without dying.Overall I give this game a 3.5 to a 4 star rating. It is definitely not as good as the first two, just a heck of a lot more frustrating but indeed it was a challenge and Lara Croft is still a fun character to play with so I can't hate this game, but I definitely will not play it again for a long time. It is just too stressful and hard of a game to play all the time.Do not think Tomb Raider Four is just as stressful and nearly impossible- Part Four is a lot better and I recommend it highly.",4,Tomb Raider Three Is Not The First In The Series You Should Play-,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",0.0038
