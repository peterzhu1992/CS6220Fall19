First Mature rated game and after all of these years I return back to the dungeon to claim victory. Luckily, I did. Deathtrap Dungeon is not for the gamer who is use to FPS, Fighters or 3D Games that runs on the Quake Engine. This game is for collector's of games when they were in the early stages of become Platinum Hits in the world of gaming as of today. The game works fine but, keep in mind that when you order this game get ready for a journey and one heck of a challenge.
