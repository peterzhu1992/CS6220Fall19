They're on most systems, there are books, and even a movie. The story is a good one, but I found the game to not be so great. Graphics are alright, the sound is bad though. And game play is horrible. Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore. The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female. The game is involved, just not as much fun as it shoud be",2,"no, no, no",1043366400,"01 24, 2003",-0.1624
1,AH5OGQP0S9KSU,B00000I1BJ,Alan C. Logan,"[0, 0]","Resident Evil 2. I realized I hadn't written a review for my favorite game of all time. Yes, I'm not kidding. This game has it all. Graphics, check. (Still look good today in 2009.) Gameplay, check. Music, check. Gore and zombies, check and check. It just doesn't get any better than this. I loved the original but when I got this game is when I got really hooked into the series.The game is filled with great atmosphere. There's no game that defines survival horror better than this one. This was Capcom at the height of their powers. Silent Hill is a close second in the genre. Resident Evil 2 improved upon the original in many ways. The voice is a little better though it still has moments of cheese. The weapons look better and are upgradeable, the game has two scenarios where your choices make slight differences in the other character's game.Yes this game is survival horror royalty.

6,A3SNO7AAYOXQUN,B00000I1BJ,Avatar of the Llama Iamnotamoose,"[0, 2]","My first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code: Veronica X. I was severely disappointed overall with it, and from what I've read, the whole series is the same, so I had little to no faith in it. I didn't feel the need whatsoever to play the other games, and openly spoke out against the series, even though I only played one game. But, after playing Resident Evil 4, I got intrigued by the story, so I decided to try out Resident Evil 1-3. I thought, There's no way they can be worse than Code: Veronica, so why not? And good god... was I right.Although the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke (thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code: Veronica X look like an Oscar-winning performance), that wasn't really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture, the second iteration really blew me away. Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I don't care at all about graphics in a videogame, so I'm not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant (which is why I'm not a GameCube or Xbox fan). The gameplay is very good for a survival horror - there is plenty of puzzle solving, adventure, exploration, and combat to keep the interest level up. That's what I like about survival horror: it's not just about fighting to stay alive, but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances. And, while Resident Evil 2 isn't anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series, it is still a top-notch game to play for any fan of the genre, and I highly recommend it. The first one you can play on your own; I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him, and vice versa. The reason the title of my review is I was wrong... is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyone's time. So, I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk.But, there is one issue I just can't stop from addressing: the controversy over the control scheme. Now, I won't go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody, but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view. The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way. This is a genre for puzzle solving, plotlines, exploration, and thought, not just about shooting things. They made the controls this way to render it, in a way, a sort of anti-action type of game genre. Still, though, once you get used to the controls, like me, you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough.Another thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their... creative death sequences (okay, so maybe they die a second time, but this time for good). Naturally, you can blow their heads off, but even more possibilities await your execution. Sometimes, you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets, or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half, the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you. When you upgrade your shotgun later on, you can actually blow their chest in half! And, with a rocket launcher, if you fire at them square in their torso, their arms, head, and a good portion of their upper body will be gone. If you hit them to the right side, most of said side will be gone, as will their head and respective arm, yet their left arm will still be attached. Pretty cool, huh? Code: Veronica X didn't have anything like that, which is rather too bad.The only problem I had with this game, and it really isn't a problem with the game itself, is that it really made me shake my head at Code: Veronica X. It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogame-making abilities. Heck, even the first Resident Evil is better than REC:VX. For example, in the first one, the hunters had narrow, sharp, reptilian eyes, rows of razor-sharp teeth that protruded from their mouths, and they looked pretty scary, but in Code: Veronica, they didn't have such teeth (it almost looked like they didn't have any at all), and they also had small, beady eyes, making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy.Yet another good part about this game is the Titan. I must say, he is really one heck of a bad guy. But, of course, he's nowhere near as bad*ss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head. But he's cool nonetheless.So, in conclusion, if you like survival horror games, then I suggest you try this one out. But don't expect it to be better than Silent Hill, if you're a fan of that series (just as a side note).",4,I was wrong...,1136160000,"01 2, 2006",0.0043
7,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000I1BJ,B. E Jackson,"[1, 2]","Now THIS is how you're supposed to enjoy blowing through a bloody, violent game! Blood squirting from moaning zombie bodies. It's so strange and relaxing to experience this. I know you will laugh at what I am about to tell you, but I never bothered with this game when it first came out. Yeah, I know, I lost many friends because of this. I ignored this game in 1998, and my level of coolness went right down the tubes. I had to fail math and pretend to smoke cigars to fit back in with my classmates again.Children shouldn't play this game. If you think it's ok for children to see the two main characters in this game shoot and fry their way through the police station then you might not be a reasonable person. Yes that's right: you can walk through a police station in this game. If in real life you have a problem with the way cops sit in a field and watch over you to make sure you have your seat belt on (and not one of those cases where you pretend to put the seat belt on until the cop is out of view and then take it off again) you now have a place to take out your frustrations- Resident Evil 2.The weapons in this game are realistically cool. I like pulling out the magnum and shooting zombies in the head and watching their heads blow to pieces. Don't try this at home, but do try this on your Playstation. The magnum doesn't make much noise so you wouldn't think it'd be such a bad-ass weapon, but you can shoot at the head of a zombie and watch his head quietly blow to smithereens. You know you shouldn't do that in real life though, right? You'd go to jail for a very long time. And if you tried to explain to the police that you were shooting at zombies, you'd only get laughed at by the entire court room. Use your head.If this game doesn't satisfy your sick animal-like needs, then try looking for the fire blaster thing. You can cook zombies with this. It's near the end of the game hidden in a locker. Go near the locker and press the X button, and it will open and you will say sweet.In this game you have two CD's. One CD is for the Leon adventure, and the other CD is for the Claire adventure. You can choose to start the game with either Leon or Claire. To do the game completely you have to beat the game twice with Leon and twice with Claire. I've only ever played this game on easy and I had a blast. I'm sure on normal it's quite harder, maybe so hard you can't think straight and become dumb. Of course you aren't dumb, it's just that video games can confuse you sometimes.Man I'm tired. But I'm never too tired to take a couple hours from my easy-going day and blasting my way through this super cool game. The only downside is that you can't skip the cutscenes. That's fine at first, when you want to listen closely to the story (even though I didn't) but after a while you really wish Capcom would have put a skip button on this thing.Still, great game. It's old, but please don't be one of those people who thinks that just because something is old it's not good. I've been around people who think like that and they just ain't cool. Sure, these people get all the girls and all the friends, but what else? What's in sucks, and what's old is cool. You think I'm wrong? Good for you.

13,A169I83JL8QJGN,B00000I1BJ,Daniel A Moir,"[0, 0]","I played this before I played the original Resident Evil. I had just barely gotten the Playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff. Originally I hated this game because I couldn't figure out how to play it. I had been a Nintendan with occasional defects to Sega (I own a Genisis) so I was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for Playstation games. I didn't understand the pivoting, nor did I grasp the concept of holding R-1 to aim and X to shoot. I got frusterated and set it aside. However, my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen. (Yes I got killed right away.) I watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first Licker. He begged me to buy it. So I did. After a while I decided to give it another try, and once I got used to the control style I beat it. I have played this this Resident Evil, and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version. I have also bought this one the most times trying to get the ultimate edition and eventually got tired of it and bought the Dual Shock Greatest Hits version after the N64 version's FMV sequences were so terrible. Although I will not buy the forthcomming GameCube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original, I still recomend RE 2 as the most fun of the series. If for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up. GameCube owners, I recomend waiting for the GCN version as it is supposed to have all of the various enhancements that all of the various versions of this game had, including the much desired analog control the N64 version featured.",4,A fun romp through a B-Movie,1020384000,"05 3, 2002",-0.1023

17,ANS7PVYBOXVGO,B00000I1BJ,JackLiberty Steven Smith Jr.,"[0, 0]","The series of Resident Evil continues with its sequel Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation released in 1998 and developed by Capcom once again. It takes place in Raccoon City which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game. This time, the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the T-virus created by Umbrella. You get to play as two characters: Leon S. Kennedy (disc one) who is a Raccoon City Police Officer on his first day of the job and Claire Redfield (disc two) who came into town to search for her missing brother Chris Redfield who was one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game. Both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines, but it doesn&#8217;t matter what order you play them in.The gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game. You have to solve puzzles, use a limited supply of ammunition, herbs to heal wounds, carry only eight items, and use typewriters to save. It&#8217;s nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and I wish every Resident Evil game in the series was like this.You get some new weapons such as a bowgun, sub machine gun, spark gun and upgrades to Leon&#8217;s handgun, shotgun and magnum. The aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot. One downside is that auto aim isn&#8217;t set by default. When you start the game, you have to press &#8216;Select&#8217; to get to the options, select the controller settings and set the mode to &#8216;Type C&#8217; to turn the auto aim feature on. A nice new addition is that the character&#8217;s current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed. This makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you don&#8217;t have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game. The Item Boxes are back where you can store items you don&#8217;t need and pick up later, but a new item you can retrieve is the &#8216;Side Pack&#8217; which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten. Both Leon and Claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story. Leon is aided by a woman named Ada Wong who is searching for her boyfriend. Claire is aided by a 12 year old girl named Sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in Raccoon City. But even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons. The enemies in this game are really memorable; there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful, especially later in the game. Then there&#8217;s Mr. X who is like the Terminator, he always comes back to hunt you down.The most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game. Say you play as Leon and complete the game as him; well you can then play as Claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending. And you can&#8217;t play Claire&#8217;s second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her, you have to unlock it first. So in total, there are four possible scenarios in this game.Another innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as &#8220;Extreme Battle&#8221; in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrella&#8217;s Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claire&#8217;s brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called &#8220;Tofu&#8221; and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective it&#8217;s the same as Hunk&#8217;s mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. I&#8217;ve completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Don&#8217;t even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn&#8217;t worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. It&#8217;s funny, even though I can&#8217;t understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.One thing I didn&#8217;t mention yet is that the music is really awesome. It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well. There were many different versions of this game. There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStation&#8217;s DualShock controller&#8217;s analog stick and vibration function. The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;Rookie&#8221; mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game, but you can&#8217;t unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking, you have to play Normal mode to unlock them. Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo. You just go to the control settings, hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red. This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.There were also ports on the PC and Dreamcast with slightly better graphics, higher frame rate and an art gallery. There was even a port on the Game com. It was a s***ty 2D black and white handheld console by Tiger. That port is just pathetic; I&#8217;m not even going to discuss it. The best port however is the Nintendo 64 version. The sound on the Nintendo 64 version is better than the PlayStation&#8217;s version, it has updated graphics, new costumes, a setting to adjust the violence and blood color, a more responsive aiming control scheme, new files, cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety. The only thing it&#8217;s missing is the Extreme Battle mini game. But this port is equally as good as the PlayStation&#8217;s version.Any criticisms I have with this game? Well it&#8217;s hard for me to think of things I don&#8217;t like about this game, I guess a minor criticism is that you can&#8217;t skip the in game cut scenes, you couldn&#8217;t do that in the first game and it&#8217;s a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game. The problem most people have with this game is the beginning. You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun. The first time playing, you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombie&#8217;s corner and kill you. It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies. My strategy is to just run away. Hold square, press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies. Once you figure that out, it isn&#8217;t too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room. It did take me a while to figure out the controls but I&#8217;ve mastered it and you can too. The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil, but still nothing too special. That&#8217;s about all the criticisms I can think of.When I was a kid, I used to play the samples_data_script.sh out of this game and in my opinion; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game, but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played. This game still manages to be very scary, if you&#8217;re playing this for the first time, you are guaranteed to be so scared; your heart will burst out your chest. Trust me; I had my jumps even to this day. It&#8217;s more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark, with the volume turned up. This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience. I absolutely love this game, it&#8217;s just a masterpiece. I&#8217;d recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $6, or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version. Those are the best options. The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time. You will admire this game and it&#8217;s by far the best in the entire series.",5,YOU HAVE RE-ENTERED THE WORLD OF SURVIVAL HORROR,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",0.0485

It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character, (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it.",3,Not so much fun after awhile.,996537600,"07 31, 2001",0.0635

Now let's get on with my review for Resident Evil 2.I have to first mention that I did not and will not buy Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 for Gamecube... unlike Resident Evil Remake they have nothing new to offer me or you... which is sad after seeing what they did and what improvement remake was to the original Resident Evil. So let's just keep this review centered around the Original Resident Evil 2 game for PSX 1.Comparing RE 2 to RE or RE Director's Cut is like comparing Raw Horsemeat to a young Stallion. Resident Evil 2 had better graphics and sound by far, not to mention the fact that it was on a bigger bolder scale than Resident Evil. Simple bottom line folks is that if your looking for a GOOD Survival Horror game... pick this one up.I had no real gripes towards the game and I felt that the DEVs of the game did everything in the better interest for the Resident Evil genre.

Everything made me jump, now I have sort of gotten over that, I am 15 and although the music and sound(zombie moaning and feet stepping) creates this scary atmosphere, it is not THAT scary. Most of you can handle it.Anyways, I needed a strategy guide for some of it. It just, it just is unrealistic. Yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin? Why was the crank removed in the first place. We need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort, this hose we have hooked up, will release some water. Yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling, so just incase a helicopter crashed under it, or there was a mass fire under it, the hose would put it out. Yea right. Ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies won't attack you? If the police were fighting, they should of closed these shutters beforehand, so less zombies came in. Instead, they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away. Wanna get into that room? You need the crest and key and plugs buddy! How did the police actually get around this police station.Moving off of that, the game is alright. You have alot of ammo on easy, although I fear I will run out alot of the time, I usually find a pack or 2 to keep me going. The zombies themselves can take quite alot, like 5 hits to kill them. However once you get the pistol modification for Leon, they become a whole lot easier. The story is nice. 2 people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such. Theres alot of other characters though, you aren't the last 2 humans alive in the city. The game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits, finishes great. It starts randomly, but then ends where it should. It succeeds in making a good game. Good story, some action, you get to kill some of those evil zombies, and good package.",4,"Just got it, lives up to some of my expectations",1060560000,"08 11, 2003",0.0286

Resident Evil 2 had everything the original had plus tons more; bigger more detailed environments, weirder puzzles, more suspense, more blood and gore, and a compelling story that kept the gamer on the edge of their seat. In this installment you play as rookie cop Leon Kennedy or Claire Refield: the sister of Chris from the first game. Instead of a secluded mansion like the first game, this time all of Raccoon City has been infected by Umbrella's virus and you have to wade through an assortment of flesh eating zombies, mutated dogs, hunters, a new monster called the Licker (whose introduction in the game is one of the most unforgettable parts in any video game), and some unbelieveably grotesque beasts who will stop at nothing until your dead. Resident Evil 2 was an instant smash hit upon it's release and has since been regarded as a classic video game and an essential play for any gamer. Since then, the game has been re-released on other systems such as the Dreamcast, Nintendo 64, and most recently the Gamecube; so now gamers of any generation can play one of the most addicting and innovative games of all time.",5,Capcom's incredible blockbuster follow up,1058659200,"07 20, 2003",0.1683

The story is very good and interesting. The game has two disks. Each character has there own 2 versians. LEON has 2 different ways of the game. There are the A and B games for each character. LEON and CLAIR have both a's and b's. I like all versians even though the b gives you an extendid deed to do in the game and shows you the true resident evil2 game ending wich leads to the events to resident evil 4!The game disks should take about 6 to 9 hours if you dont have a guid. The a and b games are both pretty difficult if you dont have a guid. The game is amazing and has a great character desighn like ada wong. Sad how it ends for leon even thoe the b game leaves you wanderin about her during your fight with the new mutated tyrant in his b game. Over all this is one of the best in the series next to 2 and remake.Leon returns in the next resident evil game wich is in titledResident Evil 4Get 2 cause you wont be dissapointed.

The game was the sequal to one of the best Survival Horror game ever. Does this do better then its prediseccor?...YES. OH HELL YES. The game is a solid good game. The story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story. I won't spoil the story for you but the game is 2 discs and you control 2 characters(serpartly) in the game. One is a cop named Leon Kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother Chris(who was in RE1)and the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure out..I really enjoyed this game, it was fantastic. I loved the graphics for this game it was just wow. The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as. They both have 2 parts(kina). Once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character. The game is fairly lenghy if you play the WHOLE game. The game has some great twists that'll keep you up all night. Lemmi make it easier for you...Resident Evil 2 was one of the coolest Playstation games ever. It had an awesome story line, sweet graphics and decent dialoug. It is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game. In other words the game is awesome and scary.The graphics for that time were just great and comparable to Metal Gear Solid. The character model for Leon and Clair was amazing and the zombies looked even more creepy then before, not to mention the bloody gore in this game....jeez. Capcom did a great job making the graphics. kudose..The gameplay is what really made me love this game. Gun n' down zombies and solving puzzle...my type of game baby. The Puzzle are not that hard but they are pretty cool. The gameplay never gets boring and the boss fights are really cool. The gameplay may turn some off in the beggining. Mainly cause it's just runing away from zombies but later on that will change...trust me..The sound is incredible! The zombies sound so realistic and the music for the boss fights are magnifecent(my spelling sucks I know). The sound it self deserves a one star...What turned me off was the kina cheezy sci fi story. It didn't have the same spooky feeling Resident Evil 1 had in story...which causes me to take off one star...Well yeah it was a stupid move just for that but hey that's my opinion...The games has amazing graphics, great sound, lots of awesome gameplay and is one of my favorite video game series. Not only that it may possibly be the best in the series if not then It's 3.This game deserves a4.8 out 5....Resident Evil series is a superb series and anyone who loves survival horror will love it. I personaly think it's one of the best gaming series out but I don't have ALL the resident Evil games.. The only ones I have are the one that go with the story like the ones I have areAnd for any newbie out there who is trying to get into the series, if you have a gamecube and get the remake of the original and start with that...then 2, 3 then Resident Evil zero which is a really enjoyable Resident Evil game...WellLates..",4,Possibly the best Resident Evil next to 3..,1101168000,"11 23, 2004",0.2128

With four missions it is a massive game and each scenario adds its fair bit of challenge. The ending to the B scenario is mind-blowing, absolutely brilliant. There is a superb plot and it is great the way that the two scenario's (i.e. Leon A &amp; Claire B) run parallel to each other and fit in with the storyline. Some people say that this is a bit short but when you finally complete all four scenario's on easy and hard mode then you will truly appreciate the challenge that this game has to offer. There are extra games such as the HUNK and TOFU scenario that add even more depth and challenge to an already massive game. The police station gives a very atmospheric setting to the game and the new batch of monsters can also give you a hard time.

35,A3MCS7WC9OD1FF,B00000I1BJ,Zane Hasan,"[0, 0]","Resident Evil 2 picks up a little after the original game in the series. The virus that the evil Umbrella corporation has been researching managed to get out into the open, and people have been dropping dead like flies as a result. The story begins when two central characters are separated in a car crash, and both try to survive long enough to work out what on Earth is going on in Racoon City. It sounds like a very basic, even threadbare plot, and to tell the truth, it is. But therein lies the charm of Resident Evil and most all of its sequels. One can go anywhere, do anything, kill anything, and apart from the frustration of winding up with nowhere to go at times, the game will not penalise the player for it. In this day and age where racing simulators are nothing more than knowing which lever to jerk when, it makes for a nice change.Of course, as the main influence makes clear, the player soon finds themselves battling with undead citizens (and worse) throughout the course of the game. Those who like to kill everything in sight may find the going a little tough, as the game rewards the player for knowing what to kill and when. A zombie in a wide, open area does not require immediate shooting, but a licker in a confined space should be put down as quickly and quietly as possible. Knowing the difference can literally decide whether you complete this game or not. But if one does get into a situation where they are low on ammunition and are not sure where they are meant to go, they can simply keep exploring until a solution presents itself. Such is the quality of the artwork on offer that it takes a while for this to become boring.One criticism of the game that is perfectly valid is that the zombie models only seem to have four varieties. Occasionally, different types will appear if certain conditions are met, such as not picking up any items during the trip to the police station, but for the most part, it is a rather generic bunch. Another problem is the save point system, which can make the quest seem repetitive at times if resumed. However, the fun of the game truly lies in revealing threads of the plot, which, while occasionally clich&eacute;, is put together like an elegant series of Chinese boxes. Questions are raised constantly, and half the fun is in finding the answers. In a complete contrast to the second feature film, the motions and attacks of the enemy are completely consistent, and even make sense from a biological point of view. One other criticism I have that applies to all of the Resident Evil games I have played to date is that in so-called tense moments, when a mass-attack by zombies or other terrors begins, one can often tell when they have completely beaten off their opposition by when the background music calms down. Although I am not entirely sure that is a bad thing.The replay value of the game is heightened by the ability to complete one character's quest, save the results, and use them on the other's. What one does in one game directly affects what happens in the other. Decisions such as who should take the submachine gun, for example, are of great importance in the game, as are such things as opening doors or killing certain major enemies. Getting into the underground lab towards the end of the game is quite a chilling moment, too. Notwithstanding the fight that takes place on the way down, this deserted research lab is enough to put the wind up any a dedicated viewer of horror films. A contrast, as it were, to the godawful second film adaptation.If I were giving Resident Evil 2 a score, it would be ten out of ten. Sure, it is looking old considering it was originally released on the PlayStation and Dreamcast, but unlike the vast majority of games, it has the ability to withstand the test of time. It is well worth hunting around the stores that specialise in second-hand or liquidated stock for.",5,A Well Done Continuation of Resident Evil,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",-0.161
