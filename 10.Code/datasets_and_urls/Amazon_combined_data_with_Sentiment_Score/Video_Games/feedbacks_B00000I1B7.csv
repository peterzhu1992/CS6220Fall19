2,AXMHJJSBIZRAA,B00000I1B7,Gamer X Do you want the true hollywood story?,"[0, 0]",Star Soldier is very reminiscient of older scroll side-to-side games but once you've experienced the graphics and the newer style of play (ex: StarFox) it is somewhat antiquated. The levels of difficulty are easy to navigate but the variety of scenery and the gameplay is very oldschool and plays itself out quickly. Overall I would recommend it for those who want to play the old style but I wouldn't rate it better than the StarFox series or other flying games to date.,3,Nostalgic at best,1190073600,"09 18, 2007",0.277

4,A2Z63B0TTFB3FB,B00000I1B7,Koopa Paratroopa,"[0, 0]","I've had a great time with this one, you can pick from 3 alternative but well balanced ships, play with a comfortable control scheme, rake high scores and combos, use powerful special weapons, collect and preserve power-ups by staying alive, deflect shots by doing rolls and are complimented with a remarkable, engaging soundtrack. The power-ups are what make this game stand out because the ships seem to upgrade almost endlessly until you're firing more powerful and voluminous attacks.I mentioned the controls before: between the D-pad, rolling with the right-shoulder button, firing special attacks with the left-shoulder and B buttons and keeping hold on the A button and firing strategically to maintain a shot combo, it's fun and easy to use. That being said, the missions in Vanishing Earth aren't easy by any means because you need to avoid hitting ships as well as being fired on and the bosses are particularly adept at relentlessly firing at you.However, players are offered consolation in that they can continue from the beginning of the mission after losing and can store a password if they'd like (personally, I enjoy staring over from the beginning so I can keep all the power-ups I earn). And even if you don't want to play the whole game, there's a fast 2 or 5 minute arcade-style mode where you earn as high a score as you can destroying enemy vessels with maximum power upgrade from the start.I had a lot of fun switching off with a friend but it's good for single player as well. Not as flawless as Super Star Soldier and I mean that particularly with regard to the visuals of the area you fly over not being as outstanding but overall it still looks good enough not to harm the fun; Vanishing Earth is also much easier to collect for than its TurboGrafx counterpart. If you can get the cartridge around 15 - 20 dollars, I say go for it because there's hours of enjoyable content that will leave you coming back for more.",5,"Vanishing Earth, Classic!!!",1401235200,"05 28, 2014",0.4416
5,AYVSX8W94ZDDU,B00000I1B7,supernintendosp,"[1, 1]","This game is amazing. The music makes you look forward to every fight, and the pace doesn't let you blink. And yet you feel the artwork and the location you're at. You've got three highly distinct ships to use. List of them in order of difficulty:Easy: Red ship. Spread-shot Gatling gun that gets more shots in per level, but power never truly upgrades.Medium: Blue ship. Powerful pulse laser punches straight through enemies, and it gains spread upon the final level-up.Hard: Green ship. Spread shot eventually reaches a strategic half-moon shape that makes every shot count.It's a shame that no other arcade shooters exist on the N64, it could've had other great games like RayStorm and G-Darius in a heartbeat!",5,A fantastic albeit frenetic arcade shooter,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",0.0597
