Hennessey,"[3, 3]","It's a shame that the Sega Saturn didn't succeed in North America the way that it did in Japan because they received the Arcade perfect version of this game for the Saturn and to this date there still is not an Arcade perfect version of this game for any home console. You could probably find someone selling a Japanese Sega Saturn on eBay or something, but that's a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game (and maybe X-Men vs. Street Fighter too!)?As far as the PlayStation version goes, you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the PlayStations lack of RAM and VRAM (the Japanese Sega Saturn version requires a packed-in 4 MB RAM Cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the Arcade version with minimal load times). However there is a trick if you are playing a 2 player game! If both players select the same characters, then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played: 2 vs. 2 tag-team! This game plays almost exactly like the previous years X-Men vs. Street Fighter on PlayStation with some new features and different characters. If you liked the way the PlayStation port of Marvel Super Heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics. Aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation (another downside to the PlayStations lack of RAM!), this game is enjoyable enough if you aren't obsessed with the Arcade verion too much. I would still go for the Japanese Sega Saturn version since it is Arcade perfect or wait (and hope) for Capcom to release a Marvel Anthology or another Capcom Arcade Classics compilation with X-Men: Children of The Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, this game, Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2. C'mon Capcom!!!!!!",2,"Great Arcade classic comes home to PlayStation... flawed, but still fun",1172361600,"02 25, 2007",0.2878

There are some notable flaws, as the Playstation hardware is just not made to run these type of games. For instance, the biggest let down is the abscence of tag-teaming (the Playstation does not have enough RAM to store more than 2 characters within one loading session). Then there's the animation...there are definetly more than a few frames missing, but once you get used to it it's OK. However, there a few gameplay extras Capcom included to keep players interested: a &quot;helper&quot; character for each match, a healing vitality gauge, and a combo system that allows you to chain hyper combos together. Best of all though, the gameplay stays relatively fast with minimal slowdown (with the exception of extreme activity). This is another very noticeable improvement over the Playstation ports of Marvel Super Heroes and X-Men Vs. Street Fighter. If nothing else, Capcom is to be commended for putting up with the Playstation's limitations to squeeze out the best possible port of this game.",4,"Great, considering the 2D capabilites of the Playstation",973468800,"11 6, 2000",0.4706

You can always tag team your partner during the game. When you do your signature move the back ground looks has flashing lights, speaking of background I have to say what amazing 2D graphics. Even though this game says Marvel vs Street Fighter doesn't mean only the super heros fight the Street fighters you can make Spider man fight one of the X-Men. I guset they got the idea to make this game is cause the japanese are have great animes these and the U.S. challenges them.",5,the games of Street Fighter has gones to a new level,1124150400,"08 16, 2005",0.3508
4,AQMWZIH22R6LE,B00000IPEE,TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore,"[4, 6]","I've been a big fan of the Street Fighter series since its outset. And to be quite honest, playing Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be. Sure, the game is mildly entertaining, but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had, it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters. The character roster totals out at 17, with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel. There are five modes of play including battle, versus, training, hero battle, and crossover. Battle and versus are your typical one- and two-player fighting game modes. Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters. Nothing special here. Crossover mode, however, is at least somewhat interesting. You see, in the original version of MSH vs. SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight. This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter but couldn't make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation. Sadly, the tag team aspect of MSH vs. SF was also excluded for the same reason. Sure, you can still pick two characters, but you can only play as one of them. The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter. Crossover mode tries to bring the game's main selling point home. This mode allows you to pick two characters, then the computer uses the same characters you picked. This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four. If you are victorious in this battle, the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another. This is done so that you aren't playing with and against the same two characters each fight. It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade, but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak. Visually, MSH vs. SF looks good. But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart, it simply fails. The colors aren't nearly as vibrant, and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown. It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of X-Men vs. Street Fighter, though, because not nearly as much animation was cut out. This is a major plus, since frames of animation not only affect the game's appearance but timing and gameplay as well.On the gameplay side, Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay. But in the end, it's all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game. Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode, and with the overall exclusion of this mode, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter game.",4,Pretty good,1060732800,"08 13, 2003",0.0639
