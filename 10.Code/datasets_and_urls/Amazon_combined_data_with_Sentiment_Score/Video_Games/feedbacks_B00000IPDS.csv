0,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00000IPDS,ACEMAN1 HERE TO PISS YOU OFF,"[0, 0]","I got this game years ago for Christmas, I don't play it much but it does deliver what it's supposed to: a fun casual racing game. The stages and vehicles you unlock in the game are actually pretty cool and have many unique designs to them. The racing never really feels tedious, and has the usual fun, arcade-style racing. It never gets old to watch your VW bug shatter to pieces when it flips over or goes over a cliff. There are numerous passageways in the stages which manages to keep things fresh and entertaining. Why a 7.25 rating? The music is the biggest draw and flaw of the game because it's very boring to listen to(So just listen to your own music when playing this game), and the controls feel a bit glitchy during certain segments of the game. But, this game does offer a nice form of entertainment for an afternoon or a few hours of playing the game. If you like out of the ordinary racers Beetle Adventure Racing is for you.",4,A LONG-LOST FUN RACER 7.25 OUT OF 10,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",0.4528
1,A1KD86ZUPBA42Z,B00000IPDS,Adam Cady,"[3, 3]","This game rocks the most. Quite possibly the best racing game for the N64, Beetle Adventure Racing packs so much into a single game pak that you wonder just what exactly does go on inside of that cartridge. Unlike other N64 racing games, BAR look just as darn good as anything you'd find on many Dreamcast games. The graphics are lush. Plus, there's stuff going on off of the track. Trains go by, warehouses operate and some freaky looking pumpkin things dance around. It offers much more to look at than, say, any Crusin' title. The control is superb, even the poor handling cars are a blast to play with. There's a Goldeneye multiplayer rip off where your car is outfitted with missles and bombs and the such. you get to go around collecting beetles which is just an excuse to kick the living daylights out of your annoying kid brother. Not that we :cough: ever do that.",5,Shake the hand of the person who owns this.....,1005523200,"11 12, 2001",0.0947
2,A279HF3YE2K8O5,B00000IPDS,Allen Rosenberg TenThumb,"[0, 0]",Racing is my favorite genre and this is my favorite racing game. The controls are grab and go with no fine points of control. Something about them all being VW Bugs makes it appealing instead of boring. Driving in the slush and snow here approaches the feel of real driving in snow ie planning turns.,4,Great but Not for Everyone,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",0.0623
3,A36UKFV79879MD,B00000IPDS,BX Lounger,"[0, 0]","Electronic Arts was one of a small group of third party developers that supported the N64 with a decent amount of games. One of them, Beetle Adventure Racing, was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the Nintendo 64. Released in 1999, it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the game.In BAR, you pick from a variety of Volkswagen Beetles and choose from one player mode(single and championship), two player mode(race only) and beetle battle mode (two to four players.) Select from one of six tracks (first one only available from the start.) and you're off! There are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels. As you pass each track, it becomes available in the other game modes. As you beat the game under each difficulty level, you unlock additional versions of Beetles. There are number boxes scattered throughout each track. They count as points and need to be collected to earn continues and depending on the difficulty level, you need a certain amount. You can earn up to 100 points; collect them all and you unlock a multi-player track for the Beetle Battle mode (only one track is available from the start) Lastly, there are flower boxes hidden throughout each track. Finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screen.The PROS: There is so much content packed in this game, you get your money's worth instantly. First off, the graphics, music, sound effects, controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N64. Then, there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later. This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it. Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time. The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them. The Beetle Battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself (the tracks are huge so getting 3 more players is the best way to go.) This game will take you awhile to beat since it's quite challenging and that leads into...The CONS:...right here. While BAR looks and sounds like an arcade racer, it uses real car physics so part of the challenge comes to getting used to how it feels and controls. The cars you start out with are slow and rigid while the ones you unlock later on control much better. Also, the A.I. cars start off slow and don't pose a challenge but as you play through each difficulty level, they go faster, bump into you and rarely make a mistake so don't be surprised if you have to try again to finish in 1st place. This game is for those who want to put in time to unlock all the goodies here so if you want to pick up and play right away, you won't have access to the entire game from the get go.Beetle Adventure Racing is a great racer that while can be quite difficult at times, can be fun and is a good choice for those who like the San Francisco Rush and Cruis'n games. It's worth your money so those of you who like racing games and looking for a game to play with others, grab yourself a copy.",4,One of the best racing games to grace the N64,1309824000,"07 5, 2011",0.3231

It is a great game, with different difficulty levels in the championships, challenging opponents, and progressively harder courses. This is also a great game for multiplayer, with the very original and fun &quot;beetle battle&quot;Courses:Coventry Cove: A simple course for beginners, not very hard, and many interesting shortcutsMount Mayhem: Significantly harder than Coventry Cove, this course takes you on a trip through a decked-out mountain, with many surprises and shortcuts and even a ski jump that you can take your car off of.Inferno Isle: Self Explanitory. It's a course taking place on an island that is competing with a volcano, and there is also a spot where you can dive into the volcano (not into the lava, of course, but into the volcano for that matter)Sunset Sands: Egyptian themed course, running through ruins. Unlike the other courses, this one has shortcuts that make a very significant difference in your position.Metro Madness: also Self-Explanitory. A drive through the city streets at top speed, and an interesting shortcut that literally lets you drive through a hotel.Wicked Woods: A &quot;scary&quot; drive through a Sleepy Hollow style setting. Rightfully, the hardest course in the game.Altogether, I think that this is a game for anyone into the Volkswagen Beetle, racing games, or multiplayer. It combines the best interests of all elements of the racing game.",5,"Not hard, not easy, lost of fun",1039737600,"12 13, 2002",0.3515

The Championship mode is a little to easy though. But I really love the Beetle Battle mode, especially with four players. It deserves 5 stars by far. It is a game well worth the money.
