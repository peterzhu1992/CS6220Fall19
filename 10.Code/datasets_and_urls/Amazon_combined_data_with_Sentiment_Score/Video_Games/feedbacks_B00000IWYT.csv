0,A1OYBF92TASIWN,B00000IWYT,"[0, 0]","Wow...the only Game Boy games that even come close to this are probably Mario Golf and Super Mario Bros. DX. The game starts off when you wake up in a bed on Koholint Island, and you must recover your sword and shield. Once you go down to the shore and pick up your sword, an owl tells you that you must wake the Wind Fish, but in order to do that, you need the eight Instruments of the Sirens from the eight levels(Tail Cave, Bottle Grotto, Key Cavern, Angler's Tunnel, Catfish's Maw, Face Shrine, Eagle's Tower, Turtle Rock). In these levels, you pick up a good variety of items. You get the Roc's Feather for jumping, The Power Braclet for picking up rocks, the Pegasus Boots for running really fast, the Flippers for swimming, the Hookshot for clearing long gaps, a more powerful Power Bracelet, a Mirror Shield for reflecting beams, and the Magic Rod for melting ice! But some of these levels have keys, and to get the Slime Key(Level 3) and the Angler Key, you will be running crazy, all across the island. Along with that are other side missions. There is a trading game through the entire game which will lead you getting the Magnifying Lens, and with which you can see a man on the shore, who will trade you whatever is in your B button(Use the shovel) for a fine Boomerang. There are also a good deal of Secret Seashells, and if you get 20, you can get the Level 2 Sword, which can shoot beams at full power! You also get a couple friends along the way. For getting into the second level, you get to walk Bowwow, the big Chain Chomp that lives next to Marin and Tarin. He will eat the poisonous plants in front of the entrance. You can also revive the Flying Rooster, a rooster that you pick up for full flight, so you can get the Bird Key. But never forget the main mission: Wake the Wind Fish. For he is not the only one inside the egg...",5,"By far, the best Game Boy game ever",987379200,"04 16, 2001",,0.1323

3,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000IWYT,"[0, 0]","The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening is quite the impressive game.It basically takes the gameplay of A Link to the Past and combines it with the original NES Legend of Zelda (graphic-wise especially) and creates a fun adventure. You can charge your sword, run with the boots, pick up bushes and do several other things the same way as you did in A Link to the Past.Now, truth be told, A Link to the Past is easily the superior game in comparison because that game does EVERYTHING right.Link's Awakening is basically a watered down version of the same thing with a choppier framerate, less than spectacular graphics, significantly worse music, and even the size of the land is much, much smaller as well. Expect less from an exploration standpoint.However, for anyone craving A Link to the Past's style of gameplay, this is a great continuation of that legendary game. I'm not concerned about the timeline of the series- I just know Link's Awakening came out a couple years after A Link to the Past. Considering this is a Game Boy game however, and that we have to be understanding of a few shortcomings and limitations thanks to the technology at the time, this game is awesome.You have many of the same enemies making a return, along with many of the familiar items that has made the Zelda series such a spectacular source of entertainment. Some of the boss fights in Link's Awakening are fairly clever, and it seems to be a trend for Nintendo (or at least, it used to be) for the boss fights to be downright strange in their Game Boy incarnations compared to their NES and Super NES versions.My only complaint (and the reason I'm not giving Link's Awakening 5 stars) is because the dungeons have their share of boring moments from time to time, especially when it comes to key searching which can be sort of frustrating and uninteresting. Plus the dungeons appear sort of bland and uninspiring more often than not. This is a small complaint, believe me.Also, another tiny complaint (that *doesn't* affect the 4-star rating I'm giving the game) is all the Mario references. You have goombas, bomb ombs, chain chomps, bloopers, cheep cheeps, thwomps... even those cactuses from Super Mario Bros. 2 This is total overkill. If that's not enough, this next part will blow your mind. Wart from Super Mario Bros. 2, Bowser, Yoshi and even Princess Toadstool make appearances in the game! To me, I HATE when two very different games combine the enemies and pretend it's perfectly normal. It's not. I like to pretend the Zelda and Mario worlds are two separate places that should NEVER blend together. *Just* because Nintendo created both of these franchises doesn't mean I like this idea.Also, some of the enemies are sort of lame. You have pink bird creatures that smile, and all the characters seem to have enormous heads. It looks silly. The characters in A Link to the Past are more sensible and presentable.One thing I LOVE is the ability to leap over empty pits, which is probably the most underrated and useful item in the game. Oh, and I LOVE the special triangle item that certain defeated enemies leave behind that increases the strength of your sword for a temporary period of time. It's awesome!The game overall is pretty high on the challenge scale. This is mainly due to the fact you have to be careful how you manage your hearts- you're not given enough of them compared to A Link to the Past. Some of the enemies such as those shielded creatues from Castle 5 can take forever to locate their weak point, and don't even MENTION the huge pain in the rear end that is the worm fight that first appeared in Castle 3 of A Link to the Past. You thought he was annoying in that game, huh? He's back and more annoying than ever here!Overall, pick up A Link to the Past first, then the original Legend of Zelda for the NES, then Link's Awakening.",4,fun time for everyone involved!,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",B.

5,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00000IWYT,"[2, 2]","Link's Awakening is probably the best Gameboy version of Zelda ever. Although, that is left to ones' opinion....It is in my opinion, however, to be.The game begins with Link waking up in a hut. He is told by the locals that to leave and go back to Hyrule, he must awaken the Wind Fish. It lives inside an egg on top of a nearby mountain and can only be lulled from its' sleep by playing eight magical instruments. You spend your time trying to round up these eight instrumants but, in order to do so, you have to endure varying types of puzzles, traps and enemies. Each puzzle you're faced with has a logical solution, and you'll only come across a few situations that will require you to leave and get new items from the outside. Koholint Island, is big(by Gameboy standards anyhow) - even more so when you consider the hidden underground passageways, dungeons, and waterways so you'll have plenty of exploring to do with alot of secrets to uncover. You'll definitely spend countless hours playing this game.Gameboy Color/Gameboy Advance owners are granted access to an all-new exclusive dungeon(although it isn't required or necessary to complete the game) plus those with a Gameboy printer get a photo scrapbook of Link's adventures that you can copy...hence the DX(deluxe) added at the end of the title of this version.This is one classic that shouldn't be missed. If you've played any of the other Legend of Zelda games, you owe it to yourself to check it out.

I love the story line, I feel like you get to know the characters much better. It's like playing a book which is how Zelda games, the good ones, tend to feel to me. It carries a message too....I don't wish to spoil it but I will hint that link is in a land of dreams plagued by nightmares. Of the game boy Zelda games, I would recommend this one the most along with minish cap. Even though this is an older one and 2d it still feels more like a 3d one because it pulls you in. It's not too hard but it is a fair challenge (nothing like the originals) and it could be confusing if you don't know anything about Zelda but....for maybe a second Zelda game this is a good choice.",5,One of my favs,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",Bonnie Dreeke,0.4758

(If you don't know the difference, DX is in color, but the original is in shades of grey. (I guess there are a couple additions in the DX game. But I repeat, ONLY a COUPLE.)) But, it's still pretty much the same concept. There are plenty of puzzles to keep you thinking, and tons of items. The bosses are pretty hard, and they're a puzzle themselves; you need to find out what method and item you need to use against them. Graphics are good (remember I'm playing the original); they are not exceptional, but good enough that you can clearly see what things are, and there is a lot of detail. The sound is good also; you don't get bogged down in too many sounds at once, but you can hear everything that goes on. If you like action games, this is good for you; but you're going to have to think, so stay away if you don't like puzzles. PUZZLES! Wow, there sure are a lot of them. Some of them are extremely difficult, and just when you think you're going to give up, or cheat off of a walkthrough, you figure it out! Hence, it's not impossible, just difficult.

I still cannot believe how much they put into a simple game boy cartridge. I mean this game is HUGE. There are 8 dungeons, a long &quot;trading&quot; sidequest, lots of heart pieces to collect, 20+ sea shells (you only need 20 for the &quot;special&quot; prize, I'll leave that up to you), and lots of mini-quests you must complete before you even enter some dungeons. The story is simple but gets the point across and the graphics are optimized with the Game Boy Color. If you haven't played this game, you're missing out, especially if you're a fan of the Zelda games and/or the game boy. Trust me on this one.

10,A3TJA90AS6WF9,B00000IWYT,"[1, 3]","From the very first game on the old Nintendo, I have always enjoyed the Zelda games. I was very excited to find out when they released this first gameboy version so I could take the games with me. There are other Zelda gameboy/GBA games since which I have yet to play, but I do reccomend this one for your library.The level of play is very in depth, way more than the original Zelda's but about half the size of the Super NES Zelda game. The game play and style is also more similar to the Super NES version.Its a basic tale as Link is trapped on an island of mystery. You collect items and beat different mini-monsters trying to solve the riddles. There is also an owl you can call for help if you ever get confused on your adventure. There is also an onboard detailed map so there is no additional manuals or guides needed to lug around to play this game.There actually was a bug in the system which frustrated me and stopped me from playing this game for a while. It involved a warp flute in a later level and I accidently warped onto a statue causing Link to be stuck in some pixel overlap mishap.

However, there's so much good stuff in this game that I hope you won't - go find one of the FAQs or walkthroughs on the web to help you out.If you're familiar with the Pokemon game, this is similar, but you have to fight any bad guys (instead of relying on your Pokemon to do it)! This requires a bit of dexterity (something you didn't really need for Pokemon), and also some fast thinking.There are a variety of puzzles in the games, including boss monsters with specific weaknesses, areas to get through that require some fancy footwork, rock-pushing puzzles, and the usual role-playing game puzzles of figuring out what to do with some of the items you find.It's easy in spots, but challenging enough at many points to really keep your interest.The color enhancements to the original game are nice, and the music is varied and pleasant.A couple of hints for you - after you get the boots, try charging at the walls in the library. Also, if you get the bow, and equip with the bow and with bombs, you can shoot a &quot;bomb arrow&quot; by pressing both buttons at once.

14,A3MZU8A1ASX8X2,B00000IWYT,"[0, 0]","The following is in reference to the downloadable version of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX available on Nintendo eShop for the 3DS/2DS system.A colorized remake of the original Game Boy game, Link's Awakening marks the beginning of our hero's adventures in the world beyond Hyrule, leaving him stranded on an island filled with mystery and danger. Playing this shortly after beating Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages (and finishing in half the time), I'm tempted to rename it Oracle of Dreams. Released before the Oracle games, LA uses the exact same game engine; same graphics, same sound, same mechanics. This basically laid out the groundwork for every Zelda title in Game Boy Color's lifespan. Once I was fully equipped for the task, I only had the most trouble with the seventh dungeon, while I defeated most of the bosses--including the last one--on my first try. Add to that the exclusive Color Dungeon, which rewards the player with a red or blue tunic that boosts his/her offense and defense respectively, and beating LA is a tropical breeze.That's not to say I didn't get my kicks, though. There was still the whole item trading sequence to keep the player busy. And speaking of items, the equipment acquired through your quest includes swag I wish could've made it to later games like the Hookshot, the Bow and Arrow and a magic rod to light those hard-to-reach torches. LA also makes a bunch of fun references to other Nintendo mascots, and you even get to walk a flower-eating Chain Chomp. You're also followed by a talking mouse (not THAT talking mouse) who shoots photos that can be printed with the Game Boy Printer (when hooked up to a compatible system). That should come as no surprise when you consider how technologically advanced the island's inhabitants are, already having built numerous telephone booths where you can call a GamePro-type hotline.On a final note, a common problem among those who played LA is the save feature, which was fixed in later titles. To clarify, you can save by pressing all the face buttons (minus the D-Pad) at once, but only if you want to quit the game. All in all, Link's Awakening is an entertaining little diversion worth checking out at least once.The product is rated E for Everyone, containing mild violence.",4,Paradise Revisited,1387670400,"12 22, 2013",J.

The constantly changing items slightly bothered me in A Link To The Past, but in this game its even more annoying.The biggest problem I have with the game is this; the overworld map.

They are still crisp today, and the color version should alleviate some of the dated aspects of LA's graphics, but don't expect 32-bit goodness that we might see in a GBA Zelda game. The sound is traditional Zelda fare with some now-classic tunes; this was the game that introduced the now popular &quot;instrument&quot; item that does neat stuff for you.Make no mistake about it - Link's Awakening is a great game, a force to be reckoned with, and a savior for kids on long car trips.
