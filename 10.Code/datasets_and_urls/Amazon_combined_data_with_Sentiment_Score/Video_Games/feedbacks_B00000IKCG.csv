Mission objectives and dificuly are good although you won't find yourself in a lot of full-blown shoot outs. Nevertheless, it is a good game and I definitely would reccomend it.",4,"Its a good game, but it really could have been better.",975196800,"11 26, 2000",0.5057

Considering this game was made after Goldeneye, you would think it would at least have quality graphics, but no. Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating, where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character. The missions are vrey booring too. This game is very hard even on the possible setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game.",1,Worst N64 Game Ever,1044230400,"02 3, 2003",-0.3898

Even though I was losing, I was hooked to it and I didn't scream or curse the game either. So if you like those type of mind-challenging games, I recoomend this one. The only bad thing about it is the guns (you can run out of ammo FAST) but I gave the game 5 stars anyway.",5,"Very challenging, but worth it",1005264000,"11 9, 2001",0.2884

It is much better than James Bond. It doesn't have all of the gun sounds droning around. Go to the restroom or the bar.,5,Better than the rest,1389139200,"01 8, 2014",0.162
