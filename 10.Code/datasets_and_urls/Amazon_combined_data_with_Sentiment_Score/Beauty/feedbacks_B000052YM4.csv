I saw all the great reviews that were posted on amazon and I actually found it at my local drug store on sale. Score one for me!Yes, it cleans very well. It also makes my skin so smooth. I love the feeling after I've washed my face. The problem? Didn't cut down my oil production at all. I'm still just as shiny as I've ever been so this didn't help me one bit.

It wasn't really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal. I thought using the both in conjunction would just work best but I'm starting to think my skin is too sensitive and cannot take too much of the same thing? I am not quite sure... but I'm going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion. Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin..
