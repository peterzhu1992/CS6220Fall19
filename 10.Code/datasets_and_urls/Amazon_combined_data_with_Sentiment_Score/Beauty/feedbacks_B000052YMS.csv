1,A22OWLY1J6XEH8,B000052YMS,Amy,"[3, 3]","I have tried everything and beside Olay for face, this is the very best. I use it on my body and face, along with the Olay, and the results are wonderful. My skin is soft, not greasy, dewy, plump and zitless. This lotion might be a little heavier than some but my skin likes it. If u have dry or allergy-prone skin, this is for you. I tried a cheaper lotion a few weeks ago and ran back to this. Cetaphil makes several varations, so any skin need can be met. Excellent for ppl like me who hate fragrances! So great.",5,My Favorite!,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",0.3214
2,A1V5PQCFGWBM1H,B000052YMS,Feli,"[0, 1]","This is a very good moisturizer but it does take a while to sink in and stays kinda greasy so you have to blot. I have been using bp which is drying and this does help but it has no spf and is a little too thick for daytime so I am switching to something formulated for just that. Good moisturizer for nighttime. I def recommend just not for me at the moment. Good luck!EDIT- i now use this around my eyes in the morning because my morning moisturizer has sunscreen in it (the kind you cant apply in that area) and also at night on my upper eye area, i use vitamin e oil as my nighttime under eye serum lol. It keeps it moist and supple! And when my back is dry from using bp. Anyone could use this even for something as simple as hand lotion its good",3,Decent Product,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",0.3067
3,A20KJABXJLXG9G,B000052YMS,godfreygirl143 Shirley,"[0, 2]","I've had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my 'fancier', good smelling stuff. I guess you could say that I am sort of a 'lotion junky' because I have so many. I even have some in a storage room because I don't have enough room on my closet shelves for all of them. I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason. I don't know why because I hadn't even opened my Cetaphil lotion yet. Maybe because it's in such a plain bottle. But, as they say, don't judge a book by it's cover. I now know this applies to my Cetaphil lotion. For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!! I don't think my skin has felt this soft in a long time. Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft. This stuff doesn't wear off or evaporate like some others that have to be reapplied a few hours later. My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc. I will now be using this from now on as my first pick. Who knew?",5,I love this lotion....and was quite surprised.,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",0.184

It's a useless lotion because after I apply it, I have to wash my hands because I can't stand that sticky and gross feel. Urg!!

It is light and softens the skin in such a pleasant way, never leaves a greasy feeling, and has almost no fragrance. This bottle lasts years and years since you don't need but a drop to cover your face, neck and chest. Highly recommend.",5,Best moisturizer ever,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",0.1168

8,A1BHCE2409B5QF,B000052YMS,Victoria,"[3, 3]","My skin is very sensitive and very dry so i have to be very careful about what products i use. This lotion is definately a godsend. Since it doesn't have a sunscreen i only use it at night but it mosturizes really well and doesn't cause any breakouts. However, I think if you have oily or combination skin this may not work for you.",5,A must have for anyone with dry skin,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",0.3214
