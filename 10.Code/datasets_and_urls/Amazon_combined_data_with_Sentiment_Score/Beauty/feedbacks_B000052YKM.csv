The only solution is to do whatever I can to prevent them in the first place. I used the Aveeno salicylic acid pads for years, but they seems to do only a mediocre job at preventing blemishes. So I decided to go with the 2% salicylic acid in the Stridex pads and see what happened.Within a day of using these (just a light sweep over my face in the shower a few minutes before scrubbing my face with Purpose soap), the blemish I have been fighting with for the past three weeks DRIED UP and went away. In addition, my skin isn't nearly as oily in the late afternoons as it was.I was worried that these pads might be too drying for my skin, but so far that hasn't been a problem at all. Again, I do wash my face a few minutes *after* I use the pad. The pad makes me skin tingle and it's almost a relief to wash that off, so those with extremely sensitive skin might want to consider that.Also, the pads are tiny and thin. I usually have to use two to cover my entire face thoroughly. But still, they seem to be working well, and they are a great price.Highly recommended.",5,dries up stubborn blemishes and clears up skin,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",0.2529

It stops the breakouts but doesn't dry out your skin. I use it twice or thrice a day. Wouldn't use anything else.",5,Stuck on this,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",0.0568
3,A2WPLM33M35MG,B000052YKM,J. C. H.,"[0, 1]","My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated, with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two. I use this between my CeraVe foaming cleanser and my CeraVe moisturizer and they've been working very well so far. They are pretty cheap and this order came with three boxes, but if you want the most bang for your buck you can cut these pads in half. I generally don't use the entire pad so half is perfect and now you have 540 uses for ~$11.",5,Great BHA exfoliater,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",0.3108

5,A19MMYMZO363KM,B000052YKM,Lincoln County MT Focused on pinecones,"[0, 0]",I've become more unhappy with the Walmart stores in the upper north west Kalispell MT and Northern ID. They seem to have lots of stuff on a shelf but the item you are looking for is blank half the time or all the time and or worse no longer even has a place. Clearasel pads are one and I couldn't even find Stridex. I tried stridex when I couldn't get the usual at another store and over time by the end of the bottle liked them. A bit rougher but the liquid seems to stay wet all the way through the 90 pad container. And I use these also behind my ears and along my hair line and just into it on the back of my neck for mild psorisias. I think the stridex seemed to work better for that. Not sure why but it is wetter so perhaps making better contact with the skin through the hair. So when wally world let me down yet again...I looked to mail order here on Amazon. And viola...three pack which for me is 5-6 month supply.,4,I was a clearsel fan for years. But Walmart in Sandpoint? Where did it go?,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",0.0358

8,A39FXPASJ1NA96,B000052YKM,Scooterbugmom,"[1, 2]","These wipes are a great find. As many have mentioned, they are not easy to find in stores and you cannot beat the price on Amazon. I use them as an adult, just recently, for nights. I am too lazy to wash my face and these wipes have been a great help in clearing up my dull skin. I find they are gentl and non-drying. They have a light, pleasant smell to them as well. My only wish is that they come in a subscribe and save option.",5,"Easy to use, works well",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",0.3138

You need to try a smaller sample to make sure it is right for you and dont just take my word for it.Also, Amazon offers such a great value for money!
