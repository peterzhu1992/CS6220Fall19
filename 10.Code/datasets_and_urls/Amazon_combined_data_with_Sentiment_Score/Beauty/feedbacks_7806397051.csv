1,A60XNB876KYML,7806397051,Jessica H.,"[1, 1]","This palette was a decent price and I was looking for a few different shades. This palette conceals decently, however, it does somewhat cake up and crease.",3,OK Palette!,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",0.0
2,A3G6XNM240RMWA,7806397051,Karen,"[0, 1]","The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the product itself is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)",4,great quality,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",0.9729
3,A1PQFP6SAJ6D80,7806397051,Norah,"[2, 2]",I really can't tell what exactly this thing is. It's not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid. And so far I tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face.,2,Do not work on my face,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",0.0
4,A38FVHZTNQ271F,7806397051,Nova Amor,"[0, 0]","It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was okay because it lasted me for a long time. I think it does great coverage for the price I paid. It is heavy, and wears off within 30-1hr. It kinda dries your skin. I'd recommend it to people who are just looking for a cheap coverage, or beginners who are just learning to conceal.",3,It's okay.,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",0.263
5,A3BTN14HIZET6Z,7806397051,S. M. Randall WildHorseWoman,"[1, 2]","I was very happy to get this palette, now I wish it was offered in subscription form like some of the makeup we use daily is. In this unnamed set you can do a lot of blending, sculpting, highlighting and concealing. The product is nicely pigmented, it's smooth and applies well then blends out beautifully. I have normal to dry skin as I'm 59 years, this works wonderfully under my foundation. I also use a silicone based primer,which works well for my skin type to give me the fresh, dewy look I love.You get a good amount of product for your money here, so this is well worth the cost. What more can you say, if one is willing to repurchase a product then that says more than mere words.",5,Very nice palette!,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",0.5226
