0,A2W10YRC8CWAD7,B000052YMT,Amazon Customer the undersigned,"[5, 5]","Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find. I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase.",5,Must-have for sensitive skin,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",0.7914
1,AC21OUFL2RJSE,B000052YMT,Bowen Stewart Bowen Stewart,"[0, 0]","I love this cleanser. My dermatologist recommended it because it is safe even for sensitive or problem skin. After it arrived and I read the directions, I realized that it can be used even without water...just tissue it off. It is so gentle in fact that the directions recommend that when using water, you do not rinse completely, but instead leave some of it, which then acts as a moisturizer.",5,Gentle yet Effective.,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",0.308

This works great, and althoughit is more expensive than some facial cleansers, I would recommend it to anyone who is wantingto hone in on those problem areas.",5,Finally!!,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",0.3255
