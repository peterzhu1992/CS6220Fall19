I know there will be some variation, depending on what your natural hair color is and what color it is currently, but I started out with faded out blue-black hair!My end results were dark burgundy-plum color, which isn't bad, but not what I was expecting at all (see my pic I posted above).Although I like the burgundy colors and have had my hair that color many times, I was looking for a change which is why I switched to Blue-Black.The color isn't bad but it is a let down if you compare it to the box. I can't imagine what color it would be if you started out with light brown or blonde hair, but I'm sure the reddish-plum color would be intense!I would say that VIOLET BLACK is just a tad darker thanL'Oreal Feria Haircolor, Chocolate Cherry 36, 1 Application.If you're looking for a blue-black color or even a soft black color go with a different shade of black than this one because this will be more red (warmer color) than black.",3,This Is *Deep-Burgundy-Plum* Not Black,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",0.5498

10,A2IPC51HL9UUYF,B0000530ED,"Amy Y. Tell me, what is it you plan to do wi...","[2, 2]","I got tired of my blonde and red highlights- mostly because they took so much time to maintain. I was going to grow them out but then I started having those growing-out-highlights roots that look kinda crappy, especially now that I can see a few sparkles(what I call my gray hairs) showing up in there.I used the online tool at the Feria website to choose which colors would work best with my coloring, ordered the product from Amazon and dyed away. This color is a shade darker than my normal hair.I wasn't expecting much- but this stuff is amazing! Despite being a slightly darker shade, it still has tons of shine and made my hair look like it has *natural* highlights, as opposed to the chunky salon highlights(I love those, too, and was worried this color would look really flat and boring but I wanted to choose a color I thought was closest to my natural shade- and will be even closer as the color fades a little). So, no you will not get salon-style highlight results but on my hair, this product dyed all my hair evenly and it still looks fairly lively.I have relatively fine and thin hair but it is down past my shoulders. I used one box, left it on my hair for the recommended 25 minutes before washing it out. When I first mixed it, the color looked like a creamy white but slowly darkened as it was exposed to air. I used some cotton balls with water and soap to get dye off that I had gotten on my forearm, in the sink and on my forehead/ears/neck- no stains to speak of. I do recommend using gloves other than those in the kit or under the supplied ones- they break too easily and you could end up with Hey!-I-just-did-a-home-dye-job hands.Most importantly, to me, this product resulted in very even and professional looking all-over color. I can't even tell where my highlights used to begin now. I highly recommend but please follow directions. There is also a pretty pungent ammonia smell, so you'll want to make sure you have adequate ventilation. When applying, go slow and make sure the product is *really* worked into your hair. I started at the top and worked my way down. Used the entire bottle but I think it still would have been enough if I had longer hair.

I really liked the promised colour shown on the box, Hi-Lift Cool Brown (almost a caramel colour), and so wanted my hair to be the lighter brown shade promised. The actual results are nothing like the colour on the box. At best it evened out and and coloured my natural highlights to a darker shade of brown.I picked up two boxes, since I have thick hair, and took them to my beautician to ask her opinion on the colour. After talking with her I decided to let her do the colouring for me since the shade difference was so drastic. I wanted to make sure it was applied correctly. After applying as directed, 20 minutes in, my beautician checked my hair and said it's not making your hair lighter, if anything it's darker, even toned, but darker. I was quite disappointed as I had flip-flopped back and forth trying to talk myself into this extremely lighter shade for almost a month.The box promises Extreme Lightening-a promise that didn't deliver.

17,A3BMI7VGJT60Y7,B0000530ED,Autumn,"[0, 0]","I used this dye on my sister who dyes her hair red a lot. She's currently out of work (recently had a baby) and hadn't dyed her hair in months (pregnant), so we decided it would be fun to do. She chose this color because it's a bit deeper than she normally does, and she wanted to have a more intense red than she can get away with at work while she doesn't have to work. Our plan was to use this and use something like Manic Panic over some pieces to make them even more red (which we've done before with her usual reds, and it always works out well), but this came out soooo dark it looks black until it's in the light. It's like purple-red black. It's lightened up after a wash or two, but still much darker than she anticipated. We didn't even bother with step 2, adding Manic Panic over sections, because we know it's so dark it won't make much of, if any, difference. It's a nice color, but not anything like it looks on the box. She's very fair (like me, which you can see in some of my other reviews of hair dyes I've used personally), so it's a much starker contrast than she anticipated.That said, the dye itself works well, processes quickly, and wasn't overly damaging to her hair. The shampoo/conditioner combo that comes with it seems to be working well for her also (she has very long, thick, curly hair). The dye starts out a deep cherry red which lead us to originally believe it would be much brighter than we expected, but it then turned purple-ish as it processed.",2,Much darker than it appears on the box,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",0.1709

I finally decided to try L'Oreal 74 Deep Copper Shimmer instead. It was the first time I have ever dyed my hair by myself, and it was easy! There is more than enough product for a test strand and then someone with long (though not thick) hair. My hair looks just as good as it does when I have it done in the salon and feels incredibly soft. The color is exactly what it shows on the box, even at my dark brown roots! I highly recommend this. L'Oreal--please don't ever discontinue Copper Shimmer! The color is outstanding!Champagne Cocktail:NOTE: This review is for L'Oreal Feria 91: Champagne Cocktail. I am going to cover in this review what I desperately needed to find before I tried this product and couldn't.Hair type: Colored blonde with reddish-blonde roots from a salon; previously highlighted blonde from being dyed red. Hair is thick and goes past shoulders to the end of the shoulder blades.When I dyed it with Feria: 5 weeks after last salon visit, on unwashed hair; 1 box of dye was all I needed.Review: I love being a blonde but was considering going brunette to save on money and salon costs, which in the area I live are upwards of $100 at almost any salon (unless you want your hair cut by someone fresh out of beauty school--which, no offense, is too nervewracking for me personally). Then it occurred to me--perhaps I could try highlighting or coloring myself from home. I used to color my hair red (the L'Oreal Copper Shimmer) and I got so good at doing it that I did a better job than my stylist. If you're unsure about doing it yourself, check out Youtube for Kandee Johnson's how-to-dye-hair video. This is the video that taught me how to dye my own hair in a professional manner.After comparing brands, I went back to L'Oreal, as I already trusted the line and it had the best reviews. I chose Champagne Cocktail based on the L'Oreal Find my color walkthrough; I chose a cool blonde since I have pink tones to my skin and my hair (being dyed red for so long) has a tendency to lift red. I did a strand test, even though the instructions do not say to do so. I wanted to be sure that my hair would not lift extremely red (no orange for me, though I did like being a ginger in the past.)I left the color on my roots for 25 minutes and then covered the rest of my hair for 10 minutes. My roots are still slightly darker and redder than my lengths (roots are strawberry blonde, and lengths are very pale blonde), so I would probably leave it on longer the next time I refresh my color; I think I will strand test my roots for 25-45 minutes and see how that works out.I am pleasantly surprised at how this dye came out; my hair is very soft after saturating with the conditioner, and I will probably use it again. However, tomorrow I think I will try the L'Oreal Brass Banisher to see if that can cut some of the strawberry blonde out of my roots. Hope this helped someone!EDITThe Brass Banisher cut the red out of my hair! I don't have to go to a salon to get my roots to match, and I don't have to bleach them.

20,A1XYWDGW0SE1E2,B0000530ED,Bobcat8mouse,"[23, 28]","First, you absolutely must know your range of tones for your skin. Do not colour your hair prior to that discovery or you will end up with the wrong colour.Next, if you are attempting to go from blond to black, you MUST use a filler. With that said, hair colouring does require prior knowledge. Also, often times, it takes multiple applications for colour to grab well. That means you may need to colour repeatedly to get the deepest and darkest colour result. As well, a MULTI-FACETED colour product means that it will NOT deposit colour evenly. That is the entire point of the MULTI-FACETED colour product, it grabs here & there.**To prevent colour from fast-fade do this; After you colour, gently rinse hair, add a conditioner treatment, and DO NOT WASH with shampoo for 2-3 days. This helps to set the color better and prevent quick fading issues.Also if you use a lot of styling products, do not attempt to colour over hair that is coated with styling product, it will not work-out properly.Lastly, do not experiment without prior knowledge of hair colour. Seek a professional for a first time colouring, and then, you can attempt to maintain that same colour, after the fact, on your own. And stay within your range of tones such as cool versus warm.Example: If you have fair skin (veins appear bluish under skin) and blue eyes then you have cool tones. If you have hazel eyes and pale-peached, golden toned skin (veins appear greenish under skin) you are a warm tone.

The mixture turns a dark blue color when applied and developed. Although for Feria's version of blue black the color is still very shiny looking. You will not get a dull black using this brand and color. If your looking for more of a natural black or a jet black then you would definitely want to stay away from this color. Instead try using the color Black Leather for a more natural looking black. I love blue black hair for my Scene styled hair the two looks go perfect together when doing scene styled hair in a black color. There will always be some fading when using a hair color but with Feria i find that it fades only a little and its no big deal to do a touch up every once in awhile. In all my years of using this brand i have always been satisfied with its results. This color works best on Medium brown to dark brown hair to start for a more deep and darker black with a hint of blue for an undertone. Usually when starting with to much of a darkest brown to black color the blue will not always be noticeable using any brand which i have had that experience before too. In my opinion the color is very pretty and the brand never fails. When using dyes remember to always wash and rinse hair in lukewarm water to cold water to help keep colors from fading/bleeding. Especially when rinsing the dye itself out during application time. They tell you to rise the color out until water runs clear (DO NOT DO THAT) this step i do not do. I rinse about 10% of the color mixture out then use the conditioner and rinse some more. Your having to rinse your hair twice which helps fades color faster in its beginning process which can make hair seem faded faster and will fade easier. So don't rinse most of the color out during its initial application which is the most important in my opinion and it works for me. That way you still have a tiny bit of color left in your hair enough to extend the color and penetrate to keep your hair rich in color until you wash your hair for the first time. After dying i don't wash until a week to a week and a half later.,5,Feria Hair Color Starry Night Color 21 (Beautiful Blue Black Color),1343779200,"08 1, 2012",0.3157

49,A1P0JSFW184ZXJ,B0000530ED,Jen Geek Girl,"[3, 3]","Let me start by saying, I am a first time hair colorer. Within the last 2 years I have been through some extremely stressful life-changing events that have caused my hair to begin to gray despite my age. I never thought I'd be gray before I turned 30! Needless to say, I tried to pluck them until I realized I couldn't keep up. Then I tried to accept them. Then I thought, why the heck am I putting up with this?! I'll have the opportunity to gray gracefully when I'm 60! So I picked this up at a local store after a recommendation from friends, and proceeded to agonize over a color choice. My hair is naturally a medium to dark brown and I wanted a color that was similar to my own, perhaps slightly lighter, just to cover my gray and add a little dimension. I chose this color (medium brown) because it seemed the closest to my natural color. Nowhere on the box did it say this color was auburn or red or anything of the sort! So imagine my surprise as my hair starts to dry and my roots are RED! The rest of my hair was lightened slightly and did come out a lovely medium brown with hints of red, but my roots are lighter than the rest of my hair which makes the red more noticeable. It's definitely not a horrible thing. I like it and aside from the initial surprise when I saw the red, I am pleased with how it came out. I just thought it was necessary to let other ladies know that this most definitely IS red, despite what the box says.That said, being my first time coloring my hair (and doing it completely by myself, no less) I was a little anxious but the process was incredibly simple. I picked up a few tips from videos on YouTube and covered the floor in newspaper, put oil on my skin just beyond my hairline to avoid staining my skin, and wore a towel on my shoulders. The process was as simple as mixing the solution and applying it evenly throughout my hair. If you have dark hair already, it would be hard to mess this up. I've heard it can be tough to color blonde hair on your own, so I'd advise not choosing this color as a blonde unless you're prepared for a lot of red. If it turned my dark brown into red, I can only imagine what it will do to a blonde!Regarding the gray, I was aware beforehand that it can be challenging to cover gray. This color did hide the vast majority of my gray though I can pick out a few areas where the hairs are quite a bit lighter than the rest. I realized right away that these were my gray hairs that did pick up the color but did not come out as dark as the rest of my hair. It's all good to me, though, because the gray is gone! It actually looks like very subtle natural highlights and I like the effect. Just be forewarned that this product is not going to completely blend away your gray and give all your hair a uniform shade. I would probably advise against using this particular color if you're heavily grayed. I am only about 5% gray but it was enough to bother me and I am much happier with my hair now! Overall, I was very pleased with the product's simplicity and the final result, but please choose another color if you're not looking for red in your brown. :)",4,WARNING!

51,AUE4N4XKQO2HV,B0000530ED,Jessica,"[6, 7]","This is the best boxed blonde I have ever used.I've been bleaching my hair in various ways for ten years now. I've tried every boxed brand under the sun, I've gotten highlights, I've gone to the salon, and I've even had my friend bleach it (she went to Aveda). This has been the best product thus far.My hair is long and naturally a dark dirty blonde color, though it has years of different bleaches in it. This is the only boxed hair color I've used that has actually given me close-to-white results. It will always be a little bit yellowy (just a bit more golden than what's pictured on the box) but I'm sure you could really knock out any brass with a good purple-blue toner. I have not had any issues with brassiness using this brand, though. And that's amazing, considering I used to have rust-colored stains in my hair ALL THE TIME when using other brands and no amount of toner would help. I also only need one box to touch up my roots, which I do every 4 months or so, since my hair is pretty damaged from previous experiences.And the best part is, this stuff doesn't reek or burn or itch like an ammonia-based color does. Normally, I have to leave the bathroom several times during a coloring session and seek fresh air outside, but that's not the case with this! I also only leave it in for about 20 minutes for fear of causing breakage but I still get a great color out of it.The conditioner that comes with it is also good, but as previously mentioned, my hair is damaged (and dry), so I tend to use the entire tube of conditioner after coloring. This ensures that my hair actually feels healthier immediately after coloring and I see less breakage.All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone considering going blonde. Take it from me, a ten-year expert on do-it-yourself dying.(But I'll warn you. If you have really dark or reddish hair, I'd recommend going to a professional.

If you hair is dark strip it down and use a soft red or very soft honey blonde to as a base. Then the next day apply the red dye, and only leave it on 1/2 to 3/4 the time it actually requires. Rinse it twice, and then use color treated conditioner on it, not just the one in the box. It is a long story but in short the chemicals in pre-boxed dye for red don't always mix well with previously treated hair or dark hair pigments.Product ReviewThe item was pricey compared to other brands, but I haven't found another brand that gives me the deep rich red shade I wanted. It wasn't as light a red as the box, no, but it did turn out well. I also use test strips when I try a new product to avoid disaster in case the product doesn't work right.It does come out blood red and stain everything so put some lotion around the edges of our face, on your shoulders and neck, and your hands so it will wash out easier.

I am a veteran home-colorer...been doing blonde in various shades for 15 years, and yes I still have hair left. First of all, don't even try mixing this in the teensy bottle they provide. Get an old bowl or a color mixing bowl. And if you have hair even past your collar bone, get two boxes. The consistently is thick, which is great for not dripping but not great for evenly applied color. You're going to need a lot to saturate your whole head if that's what you're doing. This is a nice alternative to bleaching, yes. But with drawbacks. If you have hair darker than dirty blonde, you're going to get brassy results no matter what you do. Only with extensive bleaching using a high volume peroxide solution will you get snowy white locks. I started with dirty blonde today, and my hair is a very, very light blonde now. I used the violet-tinted conditioner provided, and left it on my head for about 20 minutes which did counteract some brassiness I was left with. I'd recommend using a violet tinted shampoo and conditioner for maintaining your blonde and keeping brass toned down, especially if you have hard water. You can make your own purple or blue tinted conditioner by adding some manic panic or Jerome Russell dye to a large amount of cheap conditioner.If you found this review helpful, please click 'yes'...thanks!!",3,"Great results, horrible application! take my advice..",1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.0408

59,AE2RR589JLMK5,B0000530ED,KF,"[0, 0]","I read up on this before buying it from my local CVS. I had been wanting to go ombre for a while and this is one of the only kits could find. I didn't want it THAT bad that I was willing to shell out a ton of money to pay for it to get done in a salon, and I'm pretty good with my own hair so I thought I'd give it a try.I have medium/dark brown, which I've never bleached, highlighted or dyed (beyond demi-permanents that only slightly alter my color). I got it trimmed recently, so it was pretty healthy looking with only a few split ends right before I used this kit. I have very thick hair, and the bottom layers are especially dark. I do like the color of my hair, so I figured with the color being stripped down and lightened... how bad could it actually be?I was concerned and super nervous about this, especially because of all the negative reviews, and because I've never seen what my hair looks like bleached before... but I do really like the way it turned out. The last time I colored my hair (temporarily) was about 2 months ago with a demi-permanent dye that is about a shade darker and much more red than my natural color. I thought that they dye had entirely washed from my hair by now, but I could see some strawberry pigment after I used this kit.This kit itself is pretty user-friendly. I was actually very surprised with how well the brush worked with achieving the gradient look rather than the &#34;oh man, girlfriend has some SUPER bad roots, she should get that fixed&#34; look. Obviously you need to be careful about how and where you apply it to make sure the application remains consistent on both sides, and do some lighter brushing closer to the top to make sure you get that fade. I also made sure the ends of my hair were super saturated. I would recommend starting with the darkest part of your hair (so that develops for the longest time) and ending with the lightest parts (so that develops for the least amount of time). You also have to be careful about over-brushing with the brush in the kit, and apply the bleach quickly. If the bleach starts to dry, you're going to have to yank through the strands, and yes, the bleach COULD damage your hair. That's the nature of the chemical. Stick to very small sections of hair (3-inch sections max) so you can work quickly to get the bleach in before it starts to dry, leaving you with more tangles and breakage the more you try to pull the brush through it. I stuck to the 45 mins MAX total time (per the included instructions), and my hair does not look unhealthy, fried, dry, etc., but like I said before, it was pretty healthy to begin with. I showered immediately after and let my conditioner sit in for a solid amount of time.I like the way my hair looks, but I can see how this would be an issue with anyone who has any kind of dye in their hair, especially if it's semi-permanent and they had it done in the last 6-9 months. If I were to guess, most people who gave negative reviews or this product either 1. didn't apply it correctly. 2. didn't let it process for the correct amount of time, 3. didn't like the color of their hair once bleach was applied, 4. had colored their hair recently enough that it would affect it, or 5. had unhealthy/dried out hair that just didn't take to the bleach very well. I was just lucky enough to have the stars align with my current hair conditions, and the kit worked well with what I have.I gave it four stars for a few minor reasons: because the gloves that came in the box were super flimsy, and because the bleach just didn't work as well with my my darkest hair.Overall, I think this is a great kit as long as you are careful, don't have a lot of previous dye jobs, remember to deep-condition your hair afterward, and are willing to tone your ends if you are unhappy with resulting color the bleach leaves behind. Just be smart, follow the instructions, and be kind to your locks. Good luck!",4,"Works well with certain types of hair, and if you are careful!",1389571200,"01 13, 2014",0.3215

I love anything bronze; it looks great against my yellow toned fair skin (although, there is some red creeping in there).I've been coloring my own hair for a number of years. When I used to lighten it, I went to a pro. But now that I am merely adding or slightly adjusting my own shade, there are too many products available that do as well, if not better than salon results I've had.Even so, I used to sometimes pick a shade that looked great on the box, but then turned too dark for my tastes. My hair is naturally darkish medium brown. I'd tried some brownish red shades recently - and finally decided that those were not for me.I didn't, however, want a flat, mousy brown color. I wanted it to look natural, with some highlights. When I saw the L'Oreal Feria #45 French Roast / Deep Bronzed Brown and fell in love with the color - I still wondered -- will it even look close to that on me? I stood in the aisle for quite some time, weighing the odds. Staring at those little color boxes. Then I decided to take the plunge!When it was time to rinse the color out, I was nervous about what it would look like. Would it be flat and dark? So I decided that since the light in my bathroom always makes my hair look darker than it is - I would quickly turbin wrap my head and NOT look at it until I could see it in the window where more natural light pours in. I did sneak a peak, just at the top of my head.... and I liked what I saw!I ran with a hand mirror to the kitchen, the only place in this depressing little apt. (that I will soon be leaving, thank God) to get a good look. I almost could not believe my eyes. It looked JUST LIKE the box, highlights and all!I could not be happier with my results from this product. So much so, that I will point L'Oreal to this review. They deserve to know how I happy I am. And so do you, which is why I am writing this.I cannot attest to whether it will look the same on you - but I should tell you about my hair. It is extremely fine, but there is a lot of it.

More like 3-4 or even (gasp!) an entire week, in winter.My skin tone is fair-medium with yellow undertones that often appear reddish.

I have naturally auburn hair so it is very difficult to lighten, more so then even black due to the placement of the red pigment directly in the middle of the hair shaft. You literally have to nearly destroy the hair to get a light result. despite this fact I am addicted to wearing bold colors in my hair like hot pink, blue and green. For those colors to look anywhere near the way I like I need a white result. This dye gave me a white result after 2 applications spaced 5 weeks apart. I first colored my hair pink. It was lovely. I get bored though and wanted to try blue. I thought I would end up with purple because I normally still have a slight tinge of the color as it fades to the blonde. I did my roots as normal but noticed on the parts that went beyond my roots that it removed the pink completely and took only a few minutes. I did the whole head again with about 15 minutes left in the max time it is supposed to stay on your hair and I had white hair after with no hints of pink. This had never happened with bleach before.

No problem, though -as long as it's not rusty I'm OK with that.I have medium-dark hair though (I'm half Japanese, half white).

This was a little confusing to me, as there is no way that the user can completely avoid the roots when applying. I did my best though and it worked out for me.

It looks a bit darker than what's on the box (more like the color at her roots), but that may be because my hair has been previously bleached. I still like it, its even better looking than the box! Before using the Loreal Feria, I had tried the Garnier Olia, which ruined my hair. Olia is crap in a box-it will fry your hair like nobody's business, and the color lasts exactly three shampoos. Anyway, I purchased the Feria to try and cover over the damaged and faded Olia. The Feria did a great job, coloring my multi-shaded and faded hair a deep, uniform auburn color with highlights here and there. I also add jojoba to my conditioner, which is excellent for dry, damaged hair. It has lasted longer than any red box dye, and even longer than some salon colors. In the directions, it says to shampoo hair twice when rinsing out the red dye-I didn't do that. I just rinsed it. This color will continue to bleed down the drain and onto your towels, as any red dye does, but it just has a staying power that most reds don't have. Always use cool water, as cold as you can tolerate, on your red hair.I am trying to find a more natural red henna dye, and tried one from Mendahi on a sample of my hair, but have had no luck with that. I used only one box, and my hair is fine, dry, and to the bottom of my shoulder blades. I also don't use shampoo. Once or twice a week, I dissolve a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of tepid water (make very sure it's dissolved, or you will end up with white granules remaining in your dried hair!). I wet my hair in the shower, pour this into my roots, massage, rinse, and condition with 100% pure coconut conditioner mixed with jojoba oil. The first time you sub the baking soda for shampoo, you might not love the results. Just try it once or twice more; I did, and my roots are silky soft and very clean. It's also been kinder to my red color, which has the largest dye molecule, making it the most difficult color to maintain.UPDATE! Please use henna instead of chemical haircolor, it's such a better option!My hair is overprocessed, I have been bleaching it for years and had dyed it red with a box dye a few months ago (loreal r57 cherry crush). My hair was breaking, falling out like crazy and I am trying to eliminate chemicals from all of my beauty products, and typical box hair dye is overloaded with nasty toxins.I was afraid to try henna, because people will tell you that your hair will turn orange-its not true! Henna has saved my hair and I have never received so many complements! I ordered the burgandy 100 gram from HENNA GUYS, they have a website and sell here on amazon, and it provided me with two applications (my hair is past my shoulder blades). I mixed half of the package with water and a plastic spoon (no metal!), put it in an empty jumbo hair dye applicator bottle from Sallys, and applied it. It was so easy! It's not even messy, just make sure you have a damp washcloth handy to wipe up spills on your face or sink immediately. I saturated my hair, wrapped my head up in saran wrap, and went to sleep. I left it in for 11 hours, then washed it out and conditioned it. When it was dry, it had a bit of a brown orange tone, so I prepared the remaining mix, added a raw egg, and reapplied it on my hair. I left it on for five hours, heated it with a blow dryer for about five minutes, then washed it out. Remember that henna takes two days to fully develop, so be patient. It looked good when I washed and dried it, but WOW, it looked even better two days later! It has a gorgeous deep burgandy tone, its shiny and soft, and I have not had a bad hair day since! My scalp does not itch like it does after using chemical dyes, and it looks so rich and healthy! I am so in love with henna, I just can even describe the difference that it has made! I will forever be faithful to this henna brand! Customer service is so helpful, and will respond quickly to any questions about the product. Henna is addictive! I am trying the blend of burgandy and deep red next! Love it! Remember that if you aren't getting the deepness of color you want, or it looks orange, henna it again and again until you achieve the color you want! Also, if your hair has been bleached in the past, as mine has, it does take more reapplications to keep the color. It's just something you have to live with until the bleached portion of your hair grows out and you can cut it off. Henna is excellent for controlling oily scalp, which was not a problem of mine, but would be very beneficial for some people. I didn't have any problem with the smell that some people comment about, and even though I left it on for over 11 hours, I did not get a headache.*I have added a picture of my hair with the Feria.

On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair. My hair is dark brown/ black. The turnout color would be a bright intense red, exactly what I wanted. What color did my hair come out? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight. Nothing like it states on the side of the box. I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it.

(Although all color must fade eventually.) To lighten hair dramatically you must use a bleaching agent; a little helpful hint.

It is a lighter brown but very natural looking. Doesn't drip like the others when applying and didn't have that awful, eye burning smell like my old brand.

100,AG1JO6RXU26XI,B0000530ED,Wingthing,"[2, 2]","Before I used this my hair was previously dyed an orange-red, with a bright fire-engine, semi-permanent, red.The semi-perm red had faded, leaving me with streaks of the original red mixed in. So already, I KNEW that this probably would not get rid of that red shade entirely.I'd been curious about this bleach for awhile, since I usually have light blonde hair, so I snagged a box of this.First off, the formula, when mixed, is MUCH thicker than any dyes I've used before, so I did find minor difficulty making sure it was covering all my hair and even getting it out of the bottle. Some of my true color (dark blonde) was growing in, so I made sure to leave that for last.As the bleach developed, the red became an amazing light baby pink color, My roots turned a gorgeous white and the orange-red is a slightly lighter peachy-pink.It's really pretty if you're into unusual hair colors (Which I am).Another thing I noticed is how SPARKLY my hair was after dying. I imagine if my hair had been blonde to begin with, this would be lovely.The conditioner is a nice touch, it's a purple toner which really pumps up the white-factor and I also used it to successfully &#34;tone down&#34; some of the parts of my hair that were too pink.So all in all, very pleased with this. If I had used it before dying my hair red, I'm positive that it would've gotten to a nice platinum.",5,"My results were not typical, but I love this dye.",1385856000,"12 1, 2013",0.6968

My hair looked like my natural color only with pink blotches here and there. I went to bed and the next day my hair color looked a little better and my hope was restored. I took a shower and noticed the water going down the drain was pink and I assumed the color was still washing out. When my hair dried this time, the color changed again! Now I'm watching my hair color as the days pass and it seems as if the color is still adjusting to the color on the box. So if you experience the same thing I am, don't panic. The color comes in eventually.",5,Scared Me At First,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",0.2121
