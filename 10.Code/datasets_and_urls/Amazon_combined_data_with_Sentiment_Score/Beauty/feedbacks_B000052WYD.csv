I am feeling very yucky without it.I only gave it 4 stars because the consistency could be a SMIDGE more creamy, but it has decent staying power.For those who say that it doesn't cover the dark circles under the eyes, you will need to 1st use a concealer that is a shade lighter than your face's skin color first (or closer to a salmon color) and then lightly add this to the top. Watch some videos on YouTube about 'highlighting' and you will find that this color is perfect for those highlighting areas on top of your base/ foundation and normal concealer.Maybe there are better versions of this in the 'fancier' brands, but I am returning to buy this one because I know it works and takes off 10 years when used under my eyes.",4,Great highlighter for under eyes and other 'highlighting' areas,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",0.2252

It's more like Fair or light Beige. The product is creamy and blends well enough and it lasted for most of the day but I do have dry spots and it could end up looking flaky. I use a mineral or loose power over my foundation and concealed spots but it was a nightmare on any delicate areas where my fine lines exist, such as around the eyes, mouth, nose and even the chin area, made for a scary end result when using loose or mineral powder over it. In other words, the lines become more prominent and it looked really caky, especially under my eyes to cover the circles. It was obvious I was wearing concealer no matter where I was using it. It did best on the smoother planes of my face, just not in the spots I needed the coverage.The lipstick tube shape makes for an easy application and control, but that's all I really liked about it.

I've used every concealer out there, but most only further exaggerate the dark circles and worsen the appearance of bags. The good thing about this concealer is that it's extremely affordable and the yellow really does help neutralize the appearance of blue and purple veins under the eyes. The bad news is that it appears cakey when applied under powdered mineral makeup, giving a chalk-like appearance. This occurs even when the concealer is applied VERY lightly. If you use a liquid makeup, this will probably not be an issue. With other forms of makeup, it might not blend as well as you would like.
