1,AUD4GUEN4AVQA,B000052ZBP,Harriet Tubman mickey1st,"[1, 2]",Almay make-up remover towelette like wipes are much better than these Almay pads. These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them. One word: Horrible! I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes and it's still that bad. I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes. Boy was that a big mistake. Stay-away from these pads.,1,Extremely dissapointed!,1299196800,"03 4, 2011",-0.0706

I use one side of the pad for one eye, turn it over and do the other eye. I do add a couple of drops of water on the pad and it works just fine, staying moist enough to do both eyes.",5,Terrific!,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",0.0506

But, I like the extra oil to run into my eye area. I've been using these for years, and am so happy I found them here at Amazon!",5,Can't find these anywhere,1314230400,"08 25, 2011",0.4382
5,AEAIQ13BB832K,B000052ZBP,Rachaelaria,"[0, 0]",I have tried a lot of eye makeup removers including some really expensive ones. Almay pads are by far the best. They are a bit oily but they are supposed to be in order to protect the skin around your eye. (Don't get the oil free they don't work) There are 80 pads in the container but I use one pad 3 or for times so they last forever.,5,Best eye makeup remover,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",0.362
6,A1EQL66CVJ80SP,B000052ZBP,xFiendFyre Farrah,"[0, 0]","I have used both the moisturizing and the oil-free version of this makeup remover. Now, I will only rebuy the moisturizing one. The oil-free one was terrible.I can deal with having a bit of oil around my eyes after removing makeup, especially if it is moisturizing the area like it says it does. I end up going to sleep anyway after removing makeup, so it isn't a big deal. The formula is extremely gentle and it does its job without irritating the eyes. And if you don't want the oil around your eyes after removing the makeup, just take a towel and wipe it off. It is not a big deal.The oil-free one, on the other hand, irritated my eyes to no end! I couldn't even finish the container. My eyes became really red and bloodshot and I just couldn't keep using them. I am going to throw these out and re-buy the moisturizing ones.",5,"One is good, the other isn't.",1327190400,"01 22, 2012",0.0676
