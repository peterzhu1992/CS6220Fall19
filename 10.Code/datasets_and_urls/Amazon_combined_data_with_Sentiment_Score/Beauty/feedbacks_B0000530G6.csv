2,APK4O7SCK6ARK,B0000530G6,dutch girl,"[2, 2]","I was in search of a moisturizing conditioner because my hair is super dry (and color treated), so I bought this conditioner thinking that if I did not like it, I would have lost only a little under $2. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the results! Plus it smells amazing, too! (I also bought the Humectant Shampoo and really like that, too. Smells wonderful and lathers up into a very nice moisturizing; whipped consistency.) The conditioner leaves my hair very silky, shiny, and...a little secret...I also squirt the size of a dime into my hand and run it all through my hair after shampooing and conditioning for a nice leave-in conditioner. Yes...my hair is that dry! And by the way, it does not make my hair feel greasy or weighed down at all. I spray a little bit of my usual styling spray in my hair and blow it dry. My hair turns out silky, shiny, and just overall LOVELY!! I am so surprised. This stuff is really amazing, and for the price...you just can't go wrong. Obviously its not for everyone, but you won't know unless you give it a try! I will definitely buy this again, and will tell everyone about how great it is!",5,LOVE THIS SUAVE HUMECTANT CONDITIONER!!!!,1306368000,"05 26, 2011",0.4261

4,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,B0000530G6,Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...,"[4, 4]","When I was young my mother never used a conditioner on my hair. My hair would get so tangled in knots that I'd literally have to have it cut off. It was only when I discovered conditioners that I could finally grow my hair long. The conditioner is necessary for me to keep my hair tangle free.The problem I have with many conditioners is that the chemicals in them aren't great for my skin. My skin tingles or even gets sensitive after I use the conditioner. This is especially noticeable after I sleep for a night, since my hair gets on my pillow, the conditioner rubs off onto the pillow and then my face lays in that.I'm really pleased with the Suave Humectant Conditioner. It is one of the least reactant conditioners I have tried. I can use it daily without any problems. It does a great job with my hair, too. It definitely makes it easier to brush through. What's interesting is that it's labeled as a for dry or damaged hair conditioner. I would normally consider my hair to be on the oily side, but the conditioner does quite well for me. It doesn't make my hair oily.Well recommended.",5,"Gentle, Well Working",1240358400,"04 22, 2009",0.1518

6,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B0000530G6,PT Cruiser,"[2, 2]","I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the grocery store brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my conditioner in an under 4 oz. size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some. I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining conditioner to the person at the hotel front desk).I was so surprised to find that this conditioner left my fine, flyaway hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand. My hair is a tangled mess after I wash it and I have to use a conditioner. It also keeps away dryness. I couldn't tell the difference between this conditioner and my much more expensive salon brand! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven't found a single one that I don't like and I've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners. Two thumbs up for this product!",5,An excellent conditioner at a great price,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",0.1887
