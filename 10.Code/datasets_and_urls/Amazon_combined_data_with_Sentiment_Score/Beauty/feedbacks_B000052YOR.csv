I was about to run out of lotion and needed something that could handle how dry and flaky my shins and elbows tend to get - especially now when I'm flying a lot for work.The bottle arrived with the cap broken at the hinge unfortunately. Luckily, the oil hadn't leaked out and gotten all over, but it does make storage kind of obnoxious right now, so I'm going to have to steal a cap from an old shampoo bottle or something to replace this one.That aside, the product itself is great! If I was choosing on fragrance alone, this wouldn't be my first pick, but the smell is very pleasant and is growing on me. Instead of rigorously toweling myself dry after my shower, I do a cursory drying, leaving my skin quite damp and then immediately use the oil. It soaks in much better and quicker that way and can proudly say my elbows haven't been ashy in over a week! I do also use this at times on my fully dry skin, and it's still great, just a little more oily feeling at first.This product is defnitely a keeper,.

I squirt a little in the tub when I run a bath, and it keeps my skin from drying out. After I shower, I put it on my legs and they never get dry, either. It's so light that you don't feel it at all, and the scent is very light too. I did, however, order the unscented version for when my current bottle runs out. My husband is hooked on this stuff too. We keep a bottle in the shower, and when we turn the water off, we just put some on our arms and legs before we get out.

13,AD9X6ZF424FK5,B000052YOR,glowstar,"[5, 7]","I have very dry skin and tried this after all the great reviews. I am sad to report that this is not as emollient or humectant as my skin needs to find comfort. The oil feels nice and it spreads well. It takes a while for it to absorb even though it is lightweight, but that didn't bother me. I thought an oil would be extremely moisturizing, but my skin didn't feel or look very hydrated at all. In fact, it felt equally as dry (as if I had applied a dry oil) with a bit of a sheen. With a cream or lotion, the skin smoothes and plumps up with moisture. I tried this bc I was looking for something like that but even more effective, but this doesn't work. I may try this under a thicker lotion or cream to see if it adds anything as un under-layer. On it's own, it is not effective.UPDATE ON PREVIOUS REVIEW: I have found that using it in the shower helps it absorb into the skin without leaving a dry oil residue behind. However, even when I tried it with the matching lotion on top, it still did not fully hydrate my dry skin.

It takes no more than one dropper full to completely scent the entire bottle of body oil. Impressive, and with heavier oils like sweet almond it takes alot more than just one dropper to carry the scent.I use this after my shower, and just a few drops on my hand can cover an entire body area (lower leg, upper leg, arm, ect). I find the moisture to be helpful, but not enough for my legs, so I use lotion there, too. But it helps, definitely. Plus it adds a sexy sheen (as in shine, not Charlie).It's also great for suntanning, though suntanning is bad for skin anyway...this at least helps keep the skin moist and isn't so heavy that it makes me feel sticky afterwards.",5,"Light moisture, carries essential oil aroma very well",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",0.3075

The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin, almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself. Once dry, your skin is silky smooth but not oily. The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.I then apply a good moisturizer like(Olay Quench Body Lotion Extra Dry Skin - 20.2 Oz)to my hands, feet, elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.The oil and the moisturizer combine to form a moisture barrier on the skin that lasts and lasts.
