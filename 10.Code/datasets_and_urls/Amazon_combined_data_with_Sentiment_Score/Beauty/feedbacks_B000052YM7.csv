The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps and I found something better instead. Since I still had the whole bottle, I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer. I'm in my 20's so I have minimal wrinkles so I can't attest to how well it helps with those. My skin does feel tighter after using this though. Sometimes I use another moisturizer alongside this one because it can be drying. I wouldn't use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side.

13,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000052YM7,Beth Cholette doctor_beth,"[15, 19]","I waited a LONG time before writing this review because I wanted to be REALLY sure that this product was working for me. At first, I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line,Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12% Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz (45 g), and experiencing problems--it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old. Whatever the cause, I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!First, a little background information about me. I am currently in my early 40s. As a teen, I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems. In my late 20s/early 30s, however, I began to experience increasing issues with adult acne. Although the problem wasn't severe, it was quite persistent and recurrent. I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success. (The only thing that really worked was Accutane, but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)After that, I experimented with using various over-the-counter products, always with mixed results. More recently, I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs). I did a lot of research of various products both here on Amazon and on the web site Makeup Alley, and after my failed experiment with the Alpha Hydrox Souffle mentioned above, I decided to try this product, the 10% Enhanced Lotion. I am amazed by the results! Within only a week or two of discontinuing the Souffle (which made my skin break out even worse) and using the Enhanced Lotion alone, my skin was MUCH clearer.Now, after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great: NO blemishes! I do occasionally get a small pimple or two (usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle), but when that happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind. Also, I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from before I started using the Enhanced Lotion are FINALLY starting to fade as well--that is taking longer, but it IS happening.I use this product twice a day. You only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face. At night, I will apply the product slightly more generously. (It definitely does sting a bit; this occurs with all AHAs. You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.) In the morning, I will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, I will use Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz., which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (BHA; salicylic acid) and also SPF, which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity. This combination seems to be working well for me. I haven't really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when I do, I have been usingSt. Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz (283 g).I am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products. Definitely, this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it highly!",5,FINALLY a product to help with my adult acne!,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",0.1044

19,A18Z7ICRLVHBBP,B000052YM7,Catherine S.,"[6, 9]","I used this for the first time last night. My face did sting for about 10 minutes, and then I applied heavy moisturizer over it, and the stinging sensation subsided. I really liked the way my skin looked this morning. It looked brighter, and my face had less redness. I think I might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and I feel it may be overkill. I sort of like how it makes my skin red initially; it gives me some color, almost like I was in the sun, but a healthy color, not like Retin-A red, where it's splotchy and sickly looking. I hope this product doesn't break my sensitive skin out, but I will update when more time has passed. I'm using this on alternate days with Retin-A cream (both at night before bed), as I have read several places that these two products work well if you use them on alternate days. I have very delicate skin, and I can only tolerate Retin-A twice a week, or I get a lot of irritation and redness (not cute redness either).I used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so I wasn't alarmed. Lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and I don't like the way it feels on my skin while I'm sleeping. Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect; yay! :)UPDATE: I have been using this now for a few weeks, and I really like the results. I put it on after I wash my face at night, and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it. My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother. Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing. I wash twice a day, once in the morning in the shower, and then at night. I don't use a wash cloth to wash, because that is too harsh for the delicate skin. I just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute.

My arms and legs are especially affected by the spots and I've been self-conscious about them for years. I've been very happy with the Alpha Hydrox cream for my face so I decided to try the lotion on my arms and legs.I've been using it now for about 6 weeks and the change in my skin's appearance is fantastic! The spots will never go away, but they are much, much fainter and less noticeable. Overall the skin is smoother and softer and just looks and feels much better.I use this most evenings, putting it on my arms and legs while I watch TV. I wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then put on a regular moisturizing lotion. I've read warnings that the AHA will cause the skin to be more susceptible to sunburning, so I've been careful to use a body lotion with SPF 15 every morning since starting this routine. I have no idea if the AHA really makes sunburning more likely, or if the SPF lotion is making any difference, but my skin looks and feels great so I'm happy.If you have sensitive skin and haven't used AHA products before you might want to start out with a 8% solution and work your way up, but I haven't had any reaction to this lotion.

Even so, CR was quick to point out that NONE of the creams or serums, as they are oft called, made much of a difference.This cream may make your face tingle a bit--it does on mine, which indicates that it might be slightly acidic and therefore help remove the thinnest layer of skin and with it, some fine lines (whatever that means--they're not so fine to me!).

I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part. Or, at the very least, I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.About a year ago I bought this stuff and for some reason I never used it but once - maybe because it stung a little. But a month ago I had literally the worst acne flare-up I've had in years: something new every day, deep beneath the skin's surface, and it just wouldn't quit no matter what I did. I went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on Acne.org's website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne cures seem to be very hit-and-miss). Needless to say, I found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night. To my surprise, the very next morning things were looking up: the swollen areas of cystic acne looked somewhat deflated, and places I could feel were about to erupt were no longer feeling that way. Over the next couple of days, the situation went from bad to nearly cured.Since then - about a month - I've had literally had my longest stretch of acne-free living that I can remember in years. I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night. Of course, I always wear sunscreen now and have added a tiny bit of Jojoba oil to that to get totally moisturized and protected skin.I haven't even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up, and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff. Although all acne cures are likely to have different effects on different people, this has been such a miraculous change for me that I just have to recommend it. It's only $10, it lasts a good while, and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face's glow in general. In addition to being acne free, my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.10/10? I think so.",5,"Acne sufferers, do yourself this favor!",1372032000,"06 24, 2013",-0.0168

I knew from research that AHA's that had at least 10% Glycolic acid in them were supposed to even out your skin. I have always had great skin, never before had a dark spot or blemish. So I purchased this and used it after washing my face and appying Witch Hazel, (which I believe is the best thing you can put on your skin). I put a small amount of this AHA lotion all over my face and neck. I could not believe it, after only a few weeks using morning and night the light brown spots were gone!

I still have great skin, no spots and the only wrinkle I have is a line between my eyes, most people get two of them I have one!

The only thing is that you cannot use it every night because since it is not oil free, it will cause some acne to come out - how ironic right?

The price is just right and the quantity is definitely worth the bang for your buck. Don't be scared when you get a burning sensation, thats normal and proof that it is working.
