0,A2W10YRC8CWAD7,B0000531NU,Amazon Customer the undersigned,"[8, 10]","Maybelline Volum' Express Mascara is so much better than Great Lash. It goes on evenly and lengthens without clumping.I always use my mascara long past the three month suggested shelf life and it doesn't get dried out very quickly. (However using mascara after six months puts the user at a risk of infection, so be warned.)And it really is waterproof. You'll need a reliable mascara remover if you want it to come off your lashes. I've sat through tear-jerkers wearing Volum' Express and come out without a smudge (much less racoon eyes!)",5,Best Buy Drugstore Mascara,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",0.0574

2,A3DL3QEI1CWYWQ,B0000531NU,Danna D.M,"[2, 2]","This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras. It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup. It doesn't clump at all, and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes. My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove...but it's a waterproof mascara. It's supposed to be long lasting! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge. It doesn't bother me, but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime, this is not for you!",5,I love it,1375228800,"07 31, 2013",0.0635
3,A5ZJKS3MH6QO6,B0000531NU,E. Comandatore,"[0, 0]","I have been using this since it was in the light blue bottle and when this was the lone Volum Express, before the Falsies, One By One, Cat Eyes, etc. I just love it. I will say that it is a very dry mascara and takes some getting used to. The first two or three times you use it, it's really thin and feels like it's not doing anything, then it gets thicker and drier after that, which is when it'll be much easier to build volume.I layer about three coats of this to get my desired look. The first one is normal, sweeping from root to tip. The second I focus more on wiggling it in the roots, then the last I use the end of the brush to get in and separate any lashes that may have clumped up. You can even go further if you want and layer on even more if you're going for a more dramatic evening look, and you won't have to wear false lashes.I like to bend the brush into a curve to better fit my eye and I feel like that helps to coat every single lash. You can't do that with the newer rubber brushes like the one in Cover Girl Lash Blast.This stuff will not budge. I wear it in the summer even when swimming and it doesn't go anywhere. Any other mascaras will smudge right underneath my eyebrows about halfway through the day, like right where the tops of my eyelashes hit. This one doesn't do that.As far as removing it goes, I have a habit of picking of my mascara at night rather than using a makeup remover, and this is the only mascara I've ever found that just comes right off and doesn't get all goopy when I do that. If I wear other eye makeup with this mascara that I need to remove, I just use coconut oil and it all wipes off very easily.I highly recommend this mascara, but I know mascara is something that is all about personal preference. Give it a try! And remember to try it out a few times to for it to thicken up.",5,Always go back to this,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",0.2385
4,A3K0CAS7N2NHXA,B0000531NU,Ellen,"[2, 2]","I was so discouraged by the last Maybelline Mascara that I was unsure I was going to find one I liked besides the Falsies mascara. The first thing that drew me in on this was that it was waterproof, and volume. I have really thin-point-straight-down lashes, so I know I should stay away from really wet mascaras and go for volume and waterproof since they have a more waxy build. Though, this does stay wet enough to build and build to get a look I have been trying for, without massive clumping or turning my eyes into a solid mass. The second thing I was excited to see is that it came in brownish black. It is so difficult to find a mascara that is waterproof and brownish black. Usually the only waterproof one is Very Black. It looks just a touch less harsh with my skin and eyes (I have fair skin and dark brown hair), a little more natural.All in all I love this. It holds my curl and the brush is super nice and not too big.I would recommend this to anyone with thin lashes like me.",5,New Favorite,1343606400,"07 30, 2012",0.1204

I don't want &#34;monster&#34; lashes - just lashes that look a bit thicker and darker that look natural. This mascara works for me. Toward the end of the uses, it may get a clump or two on the brush, but I just wipe them off on a tissue.

This is like mascara from early 90s or something, just black stain on your lashes, that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump. Oh yes it's waterproof so it gets a one star, thats the only good thing about it....it definitely isn't pretty!!!! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME. Wasted my money thank u very much! Sigh. I want my money backkkkkkkkkk!! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding!!!

9,A1FRCHCH4RNKIJ,B0000531NU,nicky lynn,"[7, 8]","i bought this mascara because i was tired of looking like a racoon when i went to pool parties. it has definately helped and will work if you dont rub your eyes underwater. it still drips a little in the pool, but not much. i have extremely long curly lashes and this made them appear very thick as well, which i liked. it clumps a bit at first, but after a week or so, it calms down. its a good buy for the price.",4,nice mascara,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",0.3068
10,A324GIXX5SIYGA,B0000531NU,Pinktooth,"[1, 2]",It's a good mascara.
