All other brands are extra strength and have 10%, which eats away at my face and burns. This takes a few applications to fully rid my face of break outs, but it is worth the wait to avoid any burning or injury. I have really sensitive skin and roseacea. My dermatologist recommended this for me. I am glad that I took his advice. :)",5,My dermatologist recommended this product,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",0.1844

I have only the occasional pimple these days, but want a treatment that quickly dries up the oil and inflammation. The Oxy costs more but is worth the price, the Neutrogena does nothing (as far as I can tell) as a spot treatment. A better medicine will prevent scarring and disfiguring marks on your face! Early application of effective medicine can stop an emerging blemish before it becomes much worse. The Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum did a far better job for me.",2,Buy Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum Instead,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",0.1172

I had been becoming extremely frustrated with my oily skin and frequent breakouts, so I was ready to try something new. For the past 1 1/2 months, I have been religiously using this product in the morning and Clear Pore Nighttime Clarifying Gel (a BHA product) prior to bed. While I haven't seen miraculous results, I have had a reduction in breakouts, and my skin texture seems to be slowly improving. In addition, I am no longer getting the dry, flaky patches which I was getting with other products. However, my skin is still oily, and I do still experience the occasional breakout. While this product certainly might provide you with some benefits over time, keep in mind that you will not see immediate results: despite the claims, there is NO product available which can get rid of existing blemishes.",4,Some improvement over time,1084233600,"05 11, 2004",0.1287

I don't even remember how many creams, lotions etc. I tried over the years until now for adult acne. This is the first time I really see some result and I even don't use it regularly. If you put it on at night you'll see the effect the next morning. Even if the blemishes don't completely go away the next day, they reduce down in size. It helps with the redness and the pain. I have a very sensitive skin and this doesn't dry out my skin. The only minor issue is that I don't think it is completely vanishing. Some white residue still stays but it is manageable. Overall very gentle yet powerful cream. Definitely recommended.",5,I can't believe that it really works!,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",0.092

I thought Neutrogena On-the-Spot would be a good solution because of the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide. Unfortunately the product made my skin red and flaky, so much so that it is taking a few days for my skin to get back to normal. I usually have pretty good luck with Neutrogena products, but I think I'll be getting my skin care items elsewhere.",2,Too harsh despite claims of being more gentle,1317772800,"10 5, 2011",0.1865

This works if you use it just like the directions say: on clean skin, once a day initially then increase to several times daily. On day two I use it like every 2 hours.It makes the pimple or, in my case, underground monster, less visible and less irritating. It gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop. After day two it completely disappears.Honestly, the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place.

11,A13IRKEEPFTWFM,B000052YJX,KH1,"[2, 3]","I like this product and have returned to using it when the drugstore is out of my usual on-the-spot treatment. I use this product only at night - when the cream dries, it does leave a little flaky residue - for this reason, I would recommend using it only at night or other times when you aren't going to be out in public. It can dry out your skin a little. In the morning, I have noticed that my blemishes are much less noticable, though there are better on-the-spot treatments out there that do jsut as good of a job reducing blemishes and aren't quite as drying.",4,some reduction,1146787200,"05 5, 2006",0.3449

Lucky me, I got a big one right in the middle of my cheek right before vacation. I bought this on a whim and thought I'd try it on my bad timing zit. I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this. After a day, it was gone! It wasn't red and puffy anymore, and with a little make-up was nonexistant!I don't think you should slather this all over you face though, it does really dry out your skin and leaves it feeling kind of stiff and like you have dry soap on it... but overall, I think it's great!",4,It works!,1340323200,"06 22, 2012",0.2506

15,A3EZHMGGWY74HY,B000052YJX,MommaMia,"[1, 2]","The only bad thing about Neutrogena On The Spot Acne Treatment is that I didn't have it when I was a teenager, suffering from the worst acne ever! I've had acne for years and have used harsh abrasive cleaners, creams that dried my skin out, creams that irritated, and creams that did nothing at all. When I turned 25 I imagined my skin would clear up, but it never did. Then came 30, 33, 36...and the acne was still there, not as bad, certainly, but still an issue. Then I found this, and my life changed! This product WORKS...and I won't be without it. As I said, the only thing that could make it better is if I had it with me the week before the PROM!If your teenager suffers from acne, they just don't need to.

16,A3S73VLN1KOGEY,B000052YJX,Ms. Sean Crenwelge,"[1, 2]","I use this product second in my regime; I first use Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser, then this, then finish off with Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best B.P. product on the market. It is 2.5% B.P and this is the amount you need in a product, if you go over that it is much too harsh for your skin (especially mine because it is sensitive). Obviously if you have severe acne and need medication type products, that might be different for you. But for the average face, anything over 2.5% B.P is much too harsh. I actually don't buy this product on Amazon I just buy it at my local WalMart and it is about the same price on Amazon, minus the shipping charge. I'd say it's a pricey little product for the small tube you are getting, especially the way I use it all over my face but, hey it works and that's why I stick to it. The other two products I use last months and aren't that expensive for how long they last so I can afford to use this product. While it says it is an On the spot treatment, I actually use it all over my face. Because it is not a gel and it is creamy, you can't really apply it all over your face then rub it in, you'll have to apply a small amount to your finger and apply in batches. I don't find this annoying or hard to do, though some might because it takes a bit longer. When I first started using this product I only applied a small amount to my face in certain spots to get my skin used to it. Progressively over 2 weeks I began to use more and more and my skins takes it like a champ now. Even though it is a B.P. product, I actually don't get the stiff feeling after applying it all over my face. It also does not leave a white residue as other creamy products might do, it is a little difficult to work in if you're using small amounts but it goes on well. I find that it clears my skin up well but of course I get an occasional pimple or so due to that time of the month or stress or whatever, but much less than I used to! I always let this soak in for about 10 minutes or so before I put on my moisturizer. Overall, a small tube of the product and a bit pricey but it works and I would reccommend it for the average face!",5,Great to use all over!,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",0.0153
