2,AT6ZQDS9R7N3V,B000052YQ0,Hello Jodi,"[0, 0]","I live this product - it is great as a moisturizer and isn't too heavy for my oily skin. I love the scent but, unfortunately, I think that is what made my skin tingle when I first started using it. The tingle has gone away, for the most part, but people with sensitive skin or people (like me) who use things like Retin-A that make their skin sensitive, take note. I think next time I'll try the Olay Pro-X Age Repair Lotion or the Total Effects 7-In-1.",4,Basic moisturizer,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",0.3137

5,A2F09EWKV3MTO2,B000052YQ0,StillWaters,"[6, 6]","When I buy moisturizer the single most important factor is the SPF, and I also consider the price. This is a good moisturizer that not only has the proper ingredients to provide great sun protection, but is also reasonably priced and lasts a long time. I will buy another brand if it has the right ingredients and is cheaper, but this brand is available at most stores and I know I can trust it.",5,One of the few I will buy,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",0.493
