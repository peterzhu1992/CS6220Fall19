I bought it because Dr Oz recommended a retinal cream to stop the signs of sun damage, and although I am not wrinkle cream age, I spend a lot of time in the sun, so I am worried about sun damage. On the Oprah website, they listed several that were recommended, and this was the cheapest and easiest to find, so I thought it would be the first I tried. I am so happy with the results, this is all I need to try. Right away, I noticed my skin looked brighter hard to explain, but that is the only way I can describe it. After about a week of daily use, my pores look smaller, and my face feels amazingly smooth. I feel like I can wear less make up. I don't have wrinkles yet, so I can't comment on that, but hopefully continued use will help prevent bad ones (I'm realistic, I know I'll get some, but maybe they wont be so deep)The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel that I need a bit more moisturizing on some areas of my face, so I end up using more that the pearl sized amount, maybe double. I dont think the recommended pearl sized amount is nearly enough for most people with dry skin.",4,Great product,1252713600,"09 12, 2009",0.2057

Don't expect a big lather with this in fact, it's actually a good thing it doesn't lather too much (it's just right) because that can be drying to your skin just as they say you don't want an uber soapy shampoo that lathers too much because that can strip the oils from your hair drying it out.

The first time I used it, after showering I saw the difference right away. My skin was very smooth and softened, makeup went on much better too. My friends even commented and asked what I was doing different!!The product is a pearly white cream, nothing really special. The consistency reminds me a bit of clearasil, it's pretty thick. It lathers up very nicely though, and the smell is kind of a light citrus-y smell, nothing special there either. I have mild acne, and a few fine lines, and this cleanser really helps. I LOVE the effect it has on my skin, like I said nothing else really comes close, I'm pretty sure they sprinkle magic into this or something.I'm so glad they have it on Amazon, because it's not available at my store anymore.

In short, I love it. It does a great job (T-Zone, combination skin, daily moisturizing, daily sunscreen use, rarely wear make-up, mid-thirties with minimal wrinkles). I have not broken out at all since I purchased this (except for recently when I tried a new face mask). It does not have a strong smell or any cons EXCEPT possibly one.

I've always had pretty good skin, but now that I'm getting older I figured I should start really watching what I put (and don't put) on it. I read online (mostly Beautypedia) about the great effects of Retinol on the skin, so I began my search for a good Retinol product I could use at night. I have used products across all price ranges, but no matter how many high-end moisturizers/skincare products I try (I used to love Laura Mercier), I usually find myself coming back to Neutrogena products because they are well-priced (especially now that I'm on a student budget) and effective. I was very happy to discover that this product is rated a &#34;BEST&#34; on Beautypedia, and one of the cheapest of the kind.So far, I love how it feels on my skin. I have somewhat sensitive skin, so I prefer unscented products, which this one is. It hydrates my skin and makes it glow, and my skin is usually still soft in the mornings, despite being quite dry naturally.

I've got it all, plus super sensitive skin. I've been using this product during the day and even sometimes at night for a few weeks now with no irritation and great results. Some of my friends had mentioned another product that might be even better, so I briefly switched to RoC's Deep Wrinkle line. OMG. I only lasted two days using it because of the perfumes and the general heaviness/oiliness I experienced, not to mention it made my eyes water (and I didn't even put any around my eyes). I took those products back, needless to say. The grass is always greener--not.Neutrogena Healthy Skin is a great line in general. I now use the eye cream and the night creme as well as the day creme. I will stick with this line and not stray again. It goes on silky, no oily feel, no harsh perfumes, and no skin or eye irritation (and I use it around my eyes). I wake up looking a little brighter every day. Deeper smile lines and brow furrows are softening more and more, skin is more even and sun damage is lightening up. :)Love the line. Works for me.UPDATE APRIL 12, 2014 (I am now 52.5, fyi)Well, I have to admit, I've been lax about using my little best buddy face cream since I wrote my original review...To my dismay, at my skin check, my dermatologist asked me What are you doing differently since I saw you 6 months ago? Your skin looks more uneven, and I think you may even need a special cream for some developing actinic keratosis. (common rough patches from UV exposure that can lead to skin cancer). I freaked out a bit and thought immediately that about six months ago, I stopped using this cream...damn. I had moved and disrupted my routine, blah, blah, blah and thought that a couple of days wouldn't hurt me. Well, a couple of days turned into months...She told me that I could either go the prescription route that stings like an SOB and makes your face all red and weird for days....or I could go back to using the Neutrogena and STICK WITH IT.

My face looks brighter and more clear and I have a lot of acne scars that are obvious.Please note I did not use the face wash that came with the eye and face cream, I used the Neutrogena anti-blemish anti-wrinkle cream I can not comment on the face wash that came with the system.Will leave another update if anything changes with these products.",5,Creamy and thick,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",0.6489

I wanted to try a mild retinol product to see how it affected my acne prone skin and I am happy to say that there are only two products in the world that do not make me break out after using it and this is one of them. I noticed my skin was much smoother after just the first application and only improved afterwards. No tingling or burning as with other retinol products and I even applied it around my eyes without any negative reactions. There wasn't any significant improvement with the fine wrinkles that I have on my forehead due to sun exposure but it is still a wonderful night cream.

I ran out and was using some sample products I had on hand and what a mistake, my blemishes came back almost instantly.

I know Neutrogena has put Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment back on the market but I am sticking with this Anti-wrinkle stuff from now on. I highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 25 who has the intelligence to wash their face before bedtime.
