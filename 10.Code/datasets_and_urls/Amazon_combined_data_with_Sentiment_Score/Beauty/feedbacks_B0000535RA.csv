This toner leaves my face feeling very clean, yet soft (not tight or itchy), plus it has the benefits of an Alpha and Beta hydroxy. It really does help keep my pores cleaner, and therefore smaller over time.

I'm used to an oil controlling toner that keeps the shine on my forehead at bay whereas this did not control oil for me beyond an hour or so (but it does not claim to be oil controlling and is most likely due to the high alcohol content that can make skin produce more oil).All-in-all, good toner for what it's designed for. I would repurchase again. I'm now using this as my nighttime toner or on days where i'm not going anywhere where I won't need my forehead to remain shine-free.

29,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0000535RA,Rebecca of Amazon The Rebecca Review,"[43, 57]","Neutrogena's Pore Refining Cleanser is actually a wonderful 1 Step Cleanse/Exfoliate/Refine product that is perfect for traveling. Why take three products when one will work very well. In fact, my husband brought this product home when I asked him to buy me a similar product and I'm even more impressed with the Alpha and Beta Hydroxy Formula than any of the formulas with Benzoyl Peroxide.While I'm only testing this product at home, studies have shown that a combination of glycolic and salicylic acid is more effective than benzoyl peroxide. I read about it after I tried this product so my short time of personal experience proved the study was quite correct. Glycolic Acid is also found in many products sold to you by your Esthetician and it is known for stimulating collagen and elastin. It will even help to reduce acne scars and will keep dead skin cells from building up inside the hair follicles. Glycolic will also help the skin not to grow over the pores and so it prevents ingrown hairs. This product will be especially enjoyed by men who shave. Women will enjoy this product as it may prevent hormonal breakouts.This product contains Glycolic Acid which seems to prevent problems and is derived from fruit, whereas Benzoyl Peroxide has to fix the problems caused by a lack of exfoliation. So, using a product with Glycolic Acid seems to keep my skin exfoliated. While there are gentle microbeads, you don't really feel them and this is much more like a facial gel wash than an abrasive cleanser.This product impressed me so much I even sent a tube to a friend in the mail. Not something I'd normally do unless I was very impressed.For even better results, try a cream with Glycolic Acid or look for Vital Sciences Glycolic Liquid Exfoliator or Skin Eternal DMAE Serum. There are also quite a few Glycolic moisturizers for face and body from Peter Thomas Roth and Reviva. I also love the Derma E Glycolic Facial Cleanser.If you use a product with Glycolic Acid and one of the Derma E skin care creams or the Kiss My Face Under Age Organic Moisturizer, you should notice a much clearer complexion.Other essentials include:Derma E Tea Tree and E oilKiss My Face Acne GelAroma Land Problem Skin Blend - Essential oilDerma E Alpha Lipoderm with Green TeaDerma E Age-Defying Day CremeDerma E Clear Skin 2D'Arcy Drying LotionZia Sulphur MaskZia Papaya PeelDerma E Microdermabrasion ScrubJoey Pure Pores~The Rebecca Review",5,Glycolic Acid/Salicylic Combination Better than Benzoyl Peroxide,1128211200,"10 2, 2005",0.3552
