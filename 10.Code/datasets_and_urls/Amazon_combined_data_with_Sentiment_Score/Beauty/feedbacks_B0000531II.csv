2,A4Y4O849TASEB,B0000531II,Amazon Customer,"[10, 10]","This powder has a wonderful, fine, silky consistency and a pleasant smell that doesn't linger. It goes on smoothly with the included puff and controls shine for a long time--maybe not all day, but for several hours, at least. I have mostly normal/combination skin, with a forehead that can get oily and cheeks that tend toward dryness; this controlled shine all over without making any part of my face dry or itchy. It didn't reveal flaky patches or make the thin skin under my eyes look wrinkly. It's difficult to evaluate the finish because it doesn't really match my skin tone. I would expect a powder that only comes in light or medium to be more neutral, but this has a noticeable yellow tone.",5,"Light, silky, and long-lasting",1240704000,"04 26, 2009",0.0329
3,A1PUPSBRHNV0C0,B0000531II,Amelia D,"[0, 0]","Recommended.I have used this to set my L'oreal True Match liquid makeup for years. I have fairly pale skin, and this is the only powder I've found to match my skin tone. Most powders have a tendency to run pink, and I have decidedly warm undertones, so I was pleasantly pleased to find a powder that won't turn my face orange. I have also used CoverGirl's similar powder foundation, which runs slightly more pink than this (though I'd probably classify it more neutral...), and I have a tendency to buy whichever one's cheaper at the drug store. I do not, however, like the powder puff that comes with this product. It's the thin, flat, cloth-type thing that might work better for some people but cakes the powder over my foundation. Whenever I purchase this powder, I use my own face brush to apply it.",5,A truly light product,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",0.1714

5,ATR4OEHIZYVEV,B0000531II,Ashley,"[3, 3]","I went on a product-kick to find solutions for my super oily face and this is my favorite product I've found. I also bought de-slick spray from Urban Decay and Basis face wash but haven't noticed a big difference from either of those (Urban Decay's complexion prep spray is much better than the de-slick spray, FYI).This product REALLY cuts down on my oil issues! You can wear it alone for some light coverage and to feel clean when lounging around or wear it over/under makeup to stay looking matte much longer. If you've got super oily skin, you need this. Don't expect all your problems to be solved.. you'll still need oil blotting sheets and your usual methods, but I find this to be a big help. For under $5, you can't go wrong!",5,Oily skin?

15,A3RGN75LHYAG8U,B0000531II,molu,"[5, 5]","I was using Bare Escentuals mineral veil at $20 a pop (smaller container compared to this as well) with average results when a co-worker with fabulous matte skin introduced me to this when I finally asked her how she stayed shine-free all day when I had to reapply powder on my nose two to three times a day. She told me she uses the Maybelline Shine Free powder. I couldn't believe it but I tried it anyway because at $5 a container, I could just trash it if I hate it.I love it from the first use. It's not translucent. It has a bit of color. But the color is so light it really just perfects your foundation and give your a matte flawless finish. I dust it on top of my make up all over to set. Then I take a flat brush and pat down more powder on the oiliest parts like t-zone and area around the nose. Don't worry, it doesn't cake. The color doesn't build up and become unnatural looking either. It's so great at controlling oil, staying put, and looking great, I hardly reapply powder to my face the rest of the day. My make up doesn't end up in my smile lines either. I find that I rarely even use the powder in my compact anymore. I just keep it around for the mirror!I bought one container and it lasted me months. When I finally ran out and went back to Target for more, it was no longer on the shelves. I tried 5 other Targets around my work and home with no luck. I was so sad that it was discontinued. I ended up buying the Cover Girl powder thinking it would be the same but that powder was awful, dense, no oil control, and smelled. For the last several months I was back to using Bare Escentuals. And just by dumb luck I run into this again on Amazon tonight while trying to fall asleep. Why didn't I just check Amazon in the first place? Definitely putting it on my Subscribe and Save list so I can get it sent to my house regularly. So excited!!!My point is... try it. It's only $5.
