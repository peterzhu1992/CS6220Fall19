It is a very heavy make-up, but if applied correctly (to a clean face, after your primer) it holds up well. I wish they were still available in the US. Thank goodness for Amazon.",5,The only coverup makeup I use.,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",0.468

You can put it on sheer or use it as a thicker dab for concealment of blemishes or age spots. It is the best foundation ever made.

3,A3GR2VKQI53WPK,B000052Z8D,Grahamscrackers amazon addict!,"[1, 2]","I love to use this foundation stick! It's easy, portable and perfect for full face if you want a full coverage or it's great as a concealer. I have yet to find a foundation stick that is this easy to apply and truly has a FULL coverage. I have olive skin and use the true beige shade, however, it really is ok if it is too light as you can go over it with a darker powder and it looks great!",5,My go to for FULL coverage!,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",0.7939

Super easy to apply, love the portability of this product.Only complaint is that it's a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying.",5,Great for the price,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",0.2855
5,A3JQ7JBTC4M50Z,B000052Z8D,J I Means,"[1, 1]","Thank you Amazon for finding an importer for this makeup. When Max Factor stopped selling in the US, I was devastated. I then found it at another place online, but they stopped carrying it too. I hope this vendor will continue the relationship with Amazon.This makeup is creamy, covers well, and comes in a variety of shades to blend with almost any skin tone. And it is a lasting makeup. I get several month's use from each tube. I also love this makeup, because I no longer have to worry about spills when I travel. It's not magic, but it will cover those flaws and blemishes, of which I have far too many. It doesn't cake or look garish. What else can you say? It works!It is expensive, since it has to be imported, but it is worth the cost to me to. I love using it that much.",5,The best makeup I've ever used,1354924800,"12 8, 2012",0.0934

7,A3N12MEIKIOLNO,B000052Z8D,ruth ann,"[0, 0]","I have two other foundations that I mainly use but this comes a close second to them. Great coverage. Stays put. Easy to use. What more could you ask for? Maybe make it easier to find. I've been so surprised at how many stores have dropped this product. I really love Max Factor and hope it doesn't get discontinued. That would be a real shame for such a good brand. Their mascara, 2000 Calories, is one of the best I've used too. Went looking for it the other day in the store but no luck. Thank goodness we can still get it here. :)",5,Another fave.,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",0.2981
