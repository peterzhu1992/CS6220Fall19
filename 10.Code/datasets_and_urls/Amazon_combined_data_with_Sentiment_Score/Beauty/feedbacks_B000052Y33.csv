0,A309PFW8T6DMMZ,B000052Y33,art chick,"[0, 0]","I love this product. I also like the Shower Works ready-to-use kind - that one is a little easier/more convenient to use, but you pay for that convenience b/c it costs more. But both products work in terms of keeping my hair looking healthy. I would recommend using these about twice a week. For my hair, this really works - I have long, wavy, highlighted, fine hair (not thick).",5,This works great for me,1296345600,"01 30, 2011",0.4159
1,A112TFLXGBF6NI,B000052Y33,Bonnie Awesome,"[2, 2]","I've been using this once a week for 3 months. It's easy to use and only adds about 5 minutes to my morning on the day I use it. I don't follow the directions 100%. I have very long hair and have found that this works best for me:Heat up a mug of waterlet the tube sit in the hot water while I wash my face in the shower.Ring my hair out (literally)dump the water out of the mug and squeeze in the contents of the VO5 tubePush my hair down into the mugMy hair will absorb all of the hot oil. Then I run my fingers through for about a minute, maybe two. This works the product up the shaft of hair but leaves the focus on the bottom few inches.Then I rinse and wash my hair. I don't use conditioner on the hot oil day.My hair is a bit greasy that day. But very slight. I must wash it the next day. It helps with the little flyaways that I get, but it's temporary. If I used it twice a week it may work better, but it's a little pricey for me to use a box a week.I've noticed no difference in breakage or split ends.",4,Helps with flyaways,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",0.0968
2,A2J6W7OS5EAXCJ,B000052Y33,LilMiss,"[1, 3]","I have shoulder length thick hair, but the ends are brittle and break too easily due to consistent wear n tear from my heating tooks (hair dryer and flat iron used daily.) My stylist told me about this product but I didn't want to buy it from her because the product was marked up so much, so I went in search of it a year or two later. I found it at a local store more expensive than online, so I purchased it here.Wow o wow is my hair happy. My hair has a shine that wasn't there before, my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I'm having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways. My hair is noticeably softer to the touch, and easier to manage when I straighten. I'm no longer having to use the flat iron as long.Love love love this product. Buy it once, and I promise you'll want to keep buying.",5,"Only way I could have been happier, is if I would have found this product sooner!",1313539200,"08 17, 2011",0.4857
3,A36ET1TFU3F7FF,B000052Y33,Naptivia,"[6, 10]","I have natural tightly coiled African hair and have tried other hot oils included pure olive oil but wasn't satisfied with the result. I heard about using VO5 from natural hair forums and thought I'd give it a try. While using it in the shower I wasn't particularly impressed, but once my hair dried, I must say I was happy with the result. My very very tight coils were actually loosened quite a bit and hung down to my shoulder....with a lot of bounce. I will defiantly be using this product again.",5,Pretty good stuff,1301097600,"03 26, 2011",0.1374
4,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000052Y33,Rebecca of Amazon The Rebecca Review,"[17, 27]","When I am in the mood, I mix one hot oil treatment tube with an equal amount of olive oil and some Aussie three minute miracle deep conditioner. Then, I heat it just a tad in the microwave for an intensive conditioning pack treatment.Once you have this all on your hair, you cover it up and then you can use a blowdryer to heat up your hair to let it all absorb nicely.Or, as I recently found out, you can just go get the Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo and the Defrizzing Conditioner and you will be thanking me for telling you about it! ;)Realistically, you need both. You need the deep conditioning treatments and the daily shampoo/conditioner miracle of Frizz-Ease.
