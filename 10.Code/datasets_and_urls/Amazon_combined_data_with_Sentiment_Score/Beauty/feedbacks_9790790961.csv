0,A2FQZKL2KIZACO,9790790961,Ellie B.,"[1, 1]","I'm very picky when it comes to fragrance. I love to wear it, but I don't want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug. My fragrance needs to be subtle.I sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now, BRIGHT CRYSTAL is what I put on each morning.BRIGHT CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden's aroma in your direction.I put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.I can't fully describe a fragrance without including a very important aspect of the product--the bottle. BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut &#8220;crystal&#8221; stopper. It looks nice on the counter.If you enjoy a light floral scent, I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace.",5,Spring Garden in a Bottle,1394496000,"03 11, 2014",0.6779

4,A2H0VDRANZMGGX,9790790961,Shoe luva,"[1, 2]","This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance. My bottle was not open, tampered with, or have a strong alcohol smell. I love how clean this perfume smells. I tried it out at Macy's. I wanted to try a fendi scent, but the salesman asked me to try Bright Crystal and another Versace scent. I smelled the other first and then Bright Crystal. I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal. I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price. The bottle is huge! I'll be wearing this everyday to the office, I'm sure I'll receive tons of compliments. Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean, I don't have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting. Thanks amazon!",5,Smells clean,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",0.4868
