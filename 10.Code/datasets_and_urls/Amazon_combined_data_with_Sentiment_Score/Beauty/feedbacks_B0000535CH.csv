Nothing seemed to work until I decided to give this a try. It hasn't worked for the acne in my tzone, but I'll be buying Nature's Cure acne system to see if that helps.",4,Hormonal acne gone,1383091200,"10 30, 2013",0.3321
1,A2HP2KYIXS7GX4,B0000535CH,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",I just got this product and I still think it is too soon before I can accurately give an accurate review on what it has done for my skin. But I can say I LOVE the Vanishing Cream. This is the ONLY product I have ever put on my face that is completely scentless. So many products have claimed to be scentless yet have a weird smell. This product is super hydrating (shocking) considering this product contains acne medication that is known to dry out the skin.,5,Too soon.,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",0.1908

Nothing worked, Proactive, any of the drug store brand of washes/cleansers/systems. I remembered that I had used this awhile back but had to stop because it severely dried out my skin. I decided to try it out again. It's only been 4 days and my acne is almost completely gone and what is left looks like it will be gone soon and no new break outs. I'm using this with Garnier gel-cream moisturizer and so far it seems to be helping to keep the Vanishing cream that comes in this package from drying out my skin. As for the pills, I was worried they'd taste horrible (you're supposed to chew them) but they're not even chalky and don't taste like anything. For the price it is, it definitely was worth trying again. I sincerely hopes this works for you too.",4,Second Time Around,1298246400,"02 21, 2011",-0.0637

However, I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in (sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen. I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product. I didn't add anything else new to my routine and haven't had a yeast infection in years. May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product, my stomach issues stopped. I think this is a good product, but for me, the side effects were not worth it.",1,Had to stop using,1397952000,"04 20, 2014",-0.0845

I started using Nature's Cure about 2 years ago because I was desperate. Well, within a couple of months, I really noticed a difference! The pills are amazing. They really cut down on the cystic acne I get, and the cream that is included is great too. I feel it's not as harsh as some other benzoyl peroxide creams, because it doesn't dry me out as badly (but if you use it regularly, use a moisturizer or jojoba oil 15 minutes after applying the cream so that your skin doesn't dry out). Used in combination, my skin is clear! I got lazy and stopped using this for a about 3 months, thinking my skin was going to stay clear, but my cysts came back, so this really is the thing that is helping me. It's reasonably priced and I have a *very* sensitive stomach, and the pills have not upset my tummy at all. Overall, a wonderful product to try, just give it about 3 months to fully see results.",5,Works wonderfully!,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",0.2563

The pills didn't do much as far as I can see, but the cream helped a bit. But you have to mix it with moisturizer or you get SO DRY!And don't even think about putting make-up on over it because you'll get cakey as as a burnt biscuit.idk, guess some ppl had success?

Still don't know what is going on - but I think I have been using this cream and taking the pill (chewing it, as it suggests) for 4 days now, and the acne I had is gone or totally &#34;dried out&#34; and on it's way to being gone. And when I say dried out, I do not mean my skin is dry... the zits are just shrunken down. No new break-outs.To help you decide if this is for you:-I am 28, had acne as a teenager, and barely any since (until now for some reason).-I have an only T-zone (combination skin).-The amount of acne that diminished within the last 4-5 days was mild/moderate; I would say I had a tiny cluster of zits, one big one, and a few other random tiny ones in my lower T-zone area.-My skin has not been dry or oily from the cream.-The pill is chewable and doesn't really taste like anything; has the consistency of Tums (chalky) but much smaller.-The pill is to be taken twice daily.-I have not been using anything but face wash in combination with the cream (I use Earth Science gentle exfoliating scrub).I am always skeptical of things that get good reviews because for some reason they always end up not being as awesome as people say - but I am very pleased with this product.

I am the type that breaks out when my period is about to start and using this pill didn't change a thing. I broke out just as i normally would and this last month even while using the pill was nearly the worst i've had. I'm sure must just be a coincidence. I am not saying this is not a good product as we have to keep in mind one thing can't and won't work for everyone as we all have different skin types.

The teenager acne went away over the years and I never really had a problem with it again. I'm till about three months ago when my mother suddenly passed away. Flying overseas to see my family (we are a family and I am German) And all the stress and helping them with the funeral and everything ,plus the time difference, bad food -everything ..took it's toll on my skin.When we got back about a couple of days later I got the bill my skin broke out like I have never seen it before. It was worse than when I was a teenager and I'm 30 years old.For as long as I can remember I have always I cleaned my face every day with clean& clear facial cleaner and I put acne spot treatment on pimples that just show up like everybody has them. Of course when I am close to getting my periode its worse. But I have never had it like this ! I had him on the temples of my head and my forehead and under my chin and on my jawbone. Also someone my cheeks, chest area and back..My husband had tried out Proactive the year before and I have tried it sometimes on my skin . but I have to say it always dried my skin out and burned and didn't really help. I sent it back and told them I am done.So when I have to outbreak I had no idea what to do . so I look on Amazon and read through a couple of things and I saw this and ordered it . because I thought I have nothing to loose.I took it and within two weeks my skin cleared up and of course I changed my eating habits again to my normal diet plan. But this really really helped!! felt that the cream also made a big difference in that and if you follow with it it really changes something in your body. After another week my acne was pretty much gone. Even when I'm close or having my period My skin has less pimples than before! I didn't even show any more than that iam on my periode!My skin stays clear all month long and I will be reordering because I am done now with my 60 day pack.I have never seen anything this effective and I like I said you should try it . for $13 you have nothing to lose but only to gain clear skin.On a side note :I also bought the clearzine u can buy on Amazon too and took that the first week as well additionally to the natures cure. I think it made a big difference too but for the price it's a little bit too expensive but like I said I was desperate.Also I bought the acne spray from natures plus for my back . Again for the price a little bit too expensive .I have to say you can also use any facial cleaner and rub down your neck if you have a partner or boyfriend to do it for you. If not the spray is perfect because you can use it on any angle.",5,Oh my .. Miracle!,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",0.1008
