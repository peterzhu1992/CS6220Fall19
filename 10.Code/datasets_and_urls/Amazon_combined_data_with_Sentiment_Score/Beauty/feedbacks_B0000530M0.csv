1,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B0000530M0,csm,"[3, 7]","I got this shampoo hoping that it would help my dried out winter hair. Well, it made it worse! I looked like Broomhilda afterwards; it stripped my hair of anything that it had left and I looked as if I'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket wet. I don't recommend it at all if you have dry hair. If your hair is oily, then I think this would be fine. It sure smells nice and clean though! Save your money for a professional brand - they definitely overshot the marketing on these!",1,Not a great shampoo,1113523200,"04 15, 2005",0.277
2,A2UOHALGF2X77Q,B0000530M0,D. Hentze,"[0, 1]","I purchased several bottles of Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo when Amazon had it on sale for $1.24. At that price, it was a real bargain. It is a decent shampoo, that didn't dry out or leave my normal hair greasy. The shampoo is a poor man's Nexxus or Paul Mitchell formula. Having used both of those over the years, the Suave version isn't as good. If you have dry or damaged hair, you may want to look elsewhere. Also, the current Amazon price is $5.99. There is no way I'd pay this for a Suave product. If you can get it on sale, and have normal hair though, I can recommend Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo.",4,Good for the price when on sale.,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",0.1074

4,A2HYMOXLZZIZ3H,B0000530M0,Kat,"[0, 0]","Other Suave lines have worked better for me. This line isn't terrible, but it's just your average shampoo. At least that's how it was for me. It's worth trying since it's much cheaper than other brands. I did notice it slightly dried my already-dry hair out. I didn't find it very moisturizing, hence the 3 star rating.",3,Not the worst I've used,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",0.1888
5,ATN552TF5V40Z,B0000530M0,Lh,"[0, 0]","I have liked Suave's imitation Nexxus products for years but this has now been reformulated and is not as good. It's definitely not like Nexxus humectress shampoo. It's ok as a shampoo, doesn't lather as well or smell as nice as the old formula. So it's ok but if you want a Nexxus imitation, this is no longer it.",3,"Reformulated, not as good",1300147200,"03 15, 2011",0.0471

7,A13D05RAN5ES4O,B0000530M0,matapusi,"[2, 2]",I randomly got this conditioner when I saw it was only a 1.50 on sale. I was throughly surprised the first time I used it. The scent is quite enjoyable and nice. The texture feels wonderful on your hair and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely not dried out. I would recommend this conditioner to those trying to keep their hair healthy but may be on a budget and want drug store brands.,4,Awesome conditioner,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",0.4437
8,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B0000530M0,PT Cruiser,"[6, 7]","I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the grocery store brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an under 4 oz. size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some shampoo. I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand. I couldn't tell the difference! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven't found a single one that I don't like and I've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners. Two thumbs up for this product!",5,A very good shampoo at a great price,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",0.2422
