I researched new lotions online and this came up as dermatologist recommended so I took a chance and ordered it. It is perfect for moisturizing before putting on make-up because it does not leave the skin oily or greasy. I have sensitive skin and it seems to be perfect for me.,5,"Very light on the skin, yet moisturizing",1383264000,"11 1, 2013",0.5015
