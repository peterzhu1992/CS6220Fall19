The hair comes out clean and soft. Can't ask for much more.So why four stars, not five - I only give to truly outstanding products five stars. This is very good and recommended.",4,Recommended,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",0.476
2,A2ZI4RMRSA072T,B0000532VT,C. Havanac,"[4, 4]","I have tried almost every conditioner on the market and found that most are too rich and weigh my hair down or they don't moisturize enough and left a rat's nest out of my hair. Of course the superexpensive (Fekkai) ones work great but I get tired of paying that much money all the time. I was very pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked PERFECT. My hair felt conditioned but it was not weighed down and it had some body. This has a very light, pleasant scent. I highly recommend this to anyone just to try and see and at this price its not an investment.",5,Excellent Conditioner,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",0.3543
