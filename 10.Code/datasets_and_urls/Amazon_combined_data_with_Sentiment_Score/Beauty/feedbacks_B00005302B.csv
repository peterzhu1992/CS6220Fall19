It feels like you are really cleaning your hands as opposed to using fragrant soaps that don't really remove that grimy feel or dirt. It foams well and when you towell your hands, they don't feel tight or dry so I get the feeling like it's not drying out my skin. Also, to top it off, the scent is devine. It's not overpowering but subtle, and yet you can still smell it faintly for a while later.I hate using bar soaps for my hands and I love this wash. I wished it came in bulk to use as an all over body wash. I highly recommend this soap especially if you get dry hands. I find myself washing them a little more frequently throughout the day just to get that gorgeous smell back in my nose. It's a great cleanser and it looks after your skin.",5,Love it @}->---,1203292800,"02 18, 2008",0.278
