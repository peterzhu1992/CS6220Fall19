Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.The smell was okay.It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.Even in using the conditioner, my hair still looked frizzy. And I do not have frizzy hair! Mine is fine, thin, and straight. If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.Just cannot recommend this product.",2,Not impressed,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",-0.0223

My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin.",4,5 months after.. Good improvement!,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",0.3206
10,A22PKZZK5DSONS,B00004TMFE,Jeremy C,"[0, 0]","I have changed an earlier review on this product. My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now. You have to be in shape if you're bald :)",4,Gives the appearance of thicker hair.,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",0.1551

12,AQX8T9SFFK43U,B00004TMFE,Kristina Montes,"[3, 4]","6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point. It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather. It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS. My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style! It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be? New hair? Will keep you posted. I see three short hairs poking through! I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently! I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES! Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots. My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks! I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks! I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE. It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair. I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner. It's stripping the oils from my hair. I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week. WIll keep updating. I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy. That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up! That is the good part! SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.",4,Losing less hair!

13,A2ZQE4X9GYJMRI,B00004TMFE,Meno,"[0, 0]",I bought this along with the shampoo because my previous shampoo was making my hair fall. After some months of usage I can't say for sure if it thickened my hair but at least it helped stop the loss. It leaves my hair very manageable as well.

17,A1S8KORSO7AL10,B00004TMFE,S. TIERNAN,"[8, 10]","This stuff makes your hair feel thicker after using it and overall is a good product. I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better. It doesn't necessarily smell bad, but it kinda smells like lemony dish soap or like dial hand soap--like some commercial bathroom product--But you gotta hand it to them, it smells pretty damn good for a product having Saw Palmetto berries in it--in case you were unaware, saw palmetto extract and berries smell like pure vomit and death...lol! Don't worry you can't smell the saw palmetto at all. It is not strong scented, you'll just have a light fragrance of some industrial lemon-like handsoap while washing your hair.For the price, it's definitely worth it to at least try.",3,it's alright.,1296518400,"02 1, 2011",0.5423

20,A1ACH77RG6C8MN,B00004TMFE,VirtualGrace,"[0, 0]","I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)",2,Industrial strength degreaser.
