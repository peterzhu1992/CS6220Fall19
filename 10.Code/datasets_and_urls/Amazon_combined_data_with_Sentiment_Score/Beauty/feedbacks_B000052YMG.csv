0,A8HU4STYTBWF8,B000052YMG,ColdWaterCook17,"[3, 4]","I started checking out facial cleansers on Amazon because, in my late 20's I'm experiencing yet again some terrible break outs like I did back in high school. It seems the last few weeks I've tried everything and nothing worked and the toughest concealer wasn't enough to hide it. Along with the breakout, I was getting welts and redness on my cheeks, and the skin was uncomfortable and hot to touch. So I got this stuff based on the good reviews and because it was extremely mild and soap free, since I didn't think my skin could tolerate any more harshness. Its mild, has no odor and is soap free which is a plus, but i do wear light makeup every day and this wasn't enough to thoroughly clean it off every night. I know this because I gently ran a finger nail down my face after cleansing it with this stuff and there was makeup on my finger. To make matters a little worse, I started getting white heads (milia) around my cheek and chin area.. i'm pretty sure because this didn't cleanse well enough and my pores we just backing up with junk. I'm still on the hunt for another facial cleanser, but i'll keep this only because it makes a good shaving lotion. I guess thats a benefit.",3,"Mild for sensitive skin, but not a deep cleanser.",1324771200,"12 25, 2011",0.321

So, needless to say, finding a soap that doesn't irritate it can be a baffling chore. Enter: Aquanil.This stuff is, honestly, perfect. It's so soft and light in your hands that it feels only slightly more substantial than the small amounts of water you need to dab your face with pre-use. Once you're sufficiently wet enough, apply as much or as little of the soap as you want and you'll barely be able to feel it once it's in place. Scrub to your heart's content- no abrasive soap suds here- and then rinse gently with water and you're done. It's like an odorless, colorless waft of air just hit your face, not a state of the art soap product.Have sensitive skin? Tired of unpleasant soaps with weird fragrances and color additives and grainy suds? Then this is the cleanser for you. It feels like a delightful cloud passing across your skin.

2,A20ORTSQTEQX0Y,B000052YMG,Kathleen,"[0, 0]",I've been using this for years. Very mild for sensitive skin. Good for rosacea. Oil-free. Leaves my skin very soft. I found Cetaphil irritating but this never is. It doesn't irritate eyes either. I expect to buy this forever!,5,Best face cleanser I've ever used.,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",0.0645

Drake,"[3, 3]","I like this much better than cetaphil because you can use it on wet or dry skin so if you are getting in the shower you can wet your face, cleanse and rinse off. I am also washing my hand with it that has eczema and it has gotten it under control along with an RX from my derm.",5,excellent cleanser for sensitive skin,1234742400,"02 16, 2009",0.5768

It makes my skin really smooth and doesn't irritate it at all.,5,This is great for sensitive skin.,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",0.2484

I use hazel witch astringent to remove oil, then I rub this in just like a lotion...no washing with water...it cleans your face and doesn't over dry it, which can actually cause pimples. My face never has redness from other cleansers that I've used with water. Great for sensitive skin and people prone to break outs.",5,great product,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",0.2068

I would wash my face with it, then use Bioderma Sensibio H2O and I could see all the makeup I had left on my face. I gave it to a friend that uses it in the morning.",2,Didn't like the texture of this lotion,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",-0.06
