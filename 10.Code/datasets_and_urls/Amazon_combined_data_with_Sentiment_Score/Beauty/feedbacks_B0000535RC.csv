This product fits my needs perfectly. Whenever I see or feel a pimple coming on, I just take a Q-tip immersed in this astringent and clean that area - and that area only. I try not to wipe my whole face with it because it is drying. Last month my whole upper chest/neck area broke out for some reason. That was when I diligently wiped that area 2x a day, morning & night. Took care of the problem immediately.",4,Works!,1390003200,"01 18, 2014",0.02

This stuff is very effective, but it doesn't smell half as good or leave my face feeling wonderful like the Blackhead Eliminating Astringent. That said, I'll probably continue buying this product because 1) it works well, despite the strong odor and 2) I believe Blackhead Eliminating Astringent has been discontinued by Neutrogena.",4,"I like it, but...",1221004800,"09 10, 2008",0.4928
2,A3NMT0XES7THFR,B0000535RC,Ashley,"[1, 2]","I've tried other astringents, and this one is the perfect balance of effective cleansing without overdrying. Those who use this product alone probably do not get great results, but this is designed to be part of a skincare regimen, including moisturizing. I use a mild face wash, then I use this astringent to help remove any makeup that did not get removed by the face wash (makeup remover gives me breakouts). After that, I use Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish lotion. It's a very simple regimen, but extremely effective. I've tried other astringents in the same regimen, but they dried out my skin and had noticeably higher alcohol content, likely the cause of the over-drying.",5,Perfect!,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",0.2448

My fingers reek of it and I can even smell it on my face. I only bought this because it was $1 or more cheaper than the others. It is probably just a bad reaction to my own skin oils because in the bottle or on the cotton ball, it smells great.I'll be buying another brand this evening and NEVER buying this again.",1,Horrible smell,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",-0.0779
5,A1IREJVK1WBRXF,B0000535RC,M.T.,"[0, 1]","I am a fan of Neutrogena products. So, when I was looking to find a new astringent (I used to useBiore Blemish Treating Astringent, 8 Ounce), I went with this product.I was disappointed with it though. It was strange because it felt a little oily (which I actually felt was good because it meant it wasn't going to dry my skin), yet it still managed to dry my skin. Within a few days, my skin was drier that it has ever been. I only used it once a day, yet it was enough to make my skin start flaking. I stopped using it after 2 weeks, and it took a week after that for my skin to recover - after applying multiple layers of moisturizer throughout the day. This was so drying that my right hand (the hand that I used to apply the astringent) was also totally dry. The skin on part of my palm and my fingers was flaking off.Despite my experiences, I am still giving this 3 stars because if you are someone with oily skin and suffer from acne, this would probably be fine. I can see this working for teens, especially.I think that I am just at a point (translation: getting older, haha) that I don't need anything as strong as this for my skin. I have normal skin and don't experience a lot of break outs, so I ended up going with an alcohol free toner, also by Neutrogena, instead (Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner, 8.5 Ounce. It works much better for my skin type and needs.",3,"Probably great for some, but not for me",1369440000,"05 25, 2013",0.2051
6,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B0000535RC,Sneaky Burrito,"[0, 0]","I used to be a big fan of those Proactiv-style kits that contained multiple products (i.e. cleanser, toner, lotion). But I always used the products at different rates, and ended up having to purchase new kits to replace one product when I still had a whole bunch of the other products left. I didn't have much choice but to throw some perfectly good products away, and this made me feel like I wasn't getting a good deal for my money.I decided to start buying skin care lotions, cleansers, etc., separately. I knew I wanted at least one of the items to contain salicylic acid as the active ingredient, so I chose this toner (which has 2% salicylic acid). I'm happy enough with it that I will buy more when my current bottle runs out.This toner gives my face that extra clean feeling that washing/cleansing alone can't, and I do believe it cuts down on oil. I don't think it dries out my skin (although I am also using a moisturizer), and it doesn't cause any sort of reaction, even though I have sensitive skin. It also works well as a second-pass makeup remover. I wear a Neutrogena foundation that is a bit difficult to remove, and this toner really seems to help get those last traces off that washing has left behind (judging by the appearance of the cotton pad I use to apply the toner, at any rate).The only drawback I see is that this toner has some fumes (possibly because it contains a large amount of alcohol). This sometimes makes my eyes water a little bit. (I don't get it in my eyes, but just getting it near my eyes is enough.) Update: after using this for a few months, I don't notice this effect any longer.My preferred method of applying: pour a little on a cotton pad (dispensing is easy to control, by the way) and wipe it over my face. I do this twice a day; I've been doing so for close to six months now, and my skin has never looked better. Pair this with a good moisturizer so the alcohol isn't drying.",5,really works long term,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",0.2245

This product does exactly what it's supposed to. The smell is similar to theNeutrogena Clear Pore Scruband it does not burn like some astringents do.
