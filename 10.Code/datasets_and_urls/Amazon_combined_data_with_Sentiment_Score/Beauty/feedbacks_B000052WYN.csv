Since, I've used different drug store brands of liquid eyeliner and this one sort of fails in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible, but there are others out there that are better. It is waterproof, but it isn't air proof. It dries, cracks an then flakes off throughout the day. As it dries, it feels as if it tightens and shrinks (which causes the cracking). While it does this, IT ITCHES SOMETHING FIERCE! After a while, the brush starts to get weird and application gets messy. I wouldn't recommend it.",3,It's just so-so,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",0.0106

The brush is far shorter than most liquid eyeliner brushes and only one coat is needed. I haven't even used liquid liner in twelve years until the last week and first try made a very even and precise line. I bought this for the waterproof factor and since it is the first liquid eyeliner i ever owned 13 years ago. I also bought e.l.f. brand because it was incredibly cheap. For $8.99 at CVS you get 0.25 oz of product compared to almays 0.10 oz for $8.49 (not waterproof), CGs 0.08 oz at $8.99 (not waterproof), L'oreals 0.08 at $9.99 (not waterproof) and e.l.f.s 0.10 for $3.49-$7.99 (not waterproof). For a bargain shopper or even as a spare for those who don't mind shelling out their life savings got one tenth of an ounce of eyeliner, i would highly recommend this product. For those who have no hand eye coordination or can't draw a straight line to save their life I'd suggest not buying eye liner at all since you guys always blame the product instead of your own inability to properly apply the product. http://instagram.com/p/qE7J5sQ8PP/ a picture comparing the two products.",5,Not As Bad As These Reviews Will Have You Believe,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",-0.0939

I do like that it is waterproof, but I do not like that I have to apply, and reapply it several times before I can get it right. I am used to being able to use an eye liner brush to smudge, and blend, or correct the line on my upper lid, and you can not do this with this eye liner. If you do not like how you applied the line, it will flake off, yes, peel, and flake off, and you will need to start again. But, once you get it how you want, it does stay. I would not buy this liquid liner again though.",3,Would not buy again,1366848000,"04 25, 2013",0.006

The only time I get some flaking or peeling is if I apply it too thickly. I put this on early in the morning (7am or so) and don't take it off until 11 or 12 pm. And in all that time it stayed where I put it and the color stayed true.I have horrible allergies and I also have tear producing issues...combine these problems and there is really nothing I could wear to line my eyes-until I found Maybelline Lineworks. My eyes can and will at times ooze tears all day.Sometimes it looks as if I'm having a crying jag. BUT even through all this, my liner never goes anywhere! I use Ponds to take it off at night.

Don't spend a bunch of money on an eyeliner that promises to be good. Ultraliner is actually great. I'm not sure what the formula is, but it stays on kind of like a permanent glove. It was even snowing and blowing in my face making my eyes water really bad, but when I looked the eyeliner did not run and was still on. I tried it on my hand and noticed that it dries right away. It dries to a material that can actually kind of be peeled off as needed. If you try to rub it, it won't come off. It did not really budge with water either. Amazingly you can still take it off when you are ready. It does not run in your eye and I noticed unlike some eyeliners that get all over your lower lashes causing marks under your eye, Ultra Liner does not do that. I've had this eyeliner a long time and it still works. You may just want to clean the wand off though to prevent a sticky buildup. I've had more expensive liners that were just terrible. You can find Ultra Liner mostly any department or pharmacy type store and online here. My only caution is do not confuse the Line Works liner with this - they are not the same and the Line Works is terrible.",5,THE BEST DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE,1327708800,"01 28, 2012",0.0878

16,AN020YF8L8ITR,B000052WYN,Jessica,"[0, 0]","I give this product between 3.75 and 4.0 stars. There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.Pros:*Long lasting. It stays on all day, from morning until night*No flaking, peeling, fading, or smudging. It stays exactly how you applied it and doesn't give you racoon eyes.*The color is so rich, black, and dark. The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.*It dries quickly and doesn't feel wet on your eye lids.*It's affordable and you seem to get a lot of product for the price.Cons:*It is somewhat difficult to remove at night. I use makeup remover and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it completely.*It is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids. I have to screw the cap on, shake it, and then remove the brush about 3-4 times to get the look I'm going for. I don't know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it's waterproof (I think that's the reason), but it's not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.Overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging. I found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than I've had to do with other liners. It's affordable and I'd reccommend it to try, but I'm not sure if I would purchase again; I would probably try other liners before coming back to this one.",4,Really Good Drugstore Pick,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",-0.018

The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft. It's hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place. Additionally, when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries, it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering.

25,A1087Y8RJ4D422,B000052WYN,Rachel Ithen,"[0, 0]","So it took me a while to decide how well I liked this eyeliner.To start off with, it has a really deep, strong color that doesn't fade, so that was a plus. The consistency of the eyeliner itself isn't too liquidy or goopy... it's a great thickness. I've used this eyeliner for a couple years now, on and off, to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.Here's where things were iffy: after a couple of hours, the eyeliner would crack. It wouldn't smudge or bleed. It would CRACK. By the end of the day, if I hadn't reapplied it, there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line. I didn't need a makeup remover wipe to take it off, I could practically peel it off. Weird!! Was it my eye? Was it the liner? I determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD. Like, several years old. I knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so I continued to use it. It wasn't until I bought a new bottle recently that I figured this out. The new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if I wear it for a long time and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used to.The brush is advertised as tapered but it's not as tapered as I would have expected. It still has bristles; it isn't a triangular foam brush.It is indeed waterproof from personal experience.Overall, pretty good eyeliner, at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners I've tried as of late.

Cat eyes are my every day look and this liquid eyeliner does a competent job. But, it's not perfect either. I'm not sure if I should keep buying new bottles every so many weeks without using up the old ones because I think being exposed to too much air breaks down its effectiveness.

There is just enough time for me to wipe off my mistakes. Once it's on, it's ON though. The first time I wore it, I forgot to take it off before bed.
