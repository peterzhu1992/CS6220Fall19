1,AE2PHZIFBGV52,B0000530O9,bonnie brooklyn girl,"[1, 1]","I'm 75 years old, and I've been applying this gel every night for the past five or six years. There's no way of knowing if the wrinkles would be worse without it, but I think it's helping, and it feels so wonderful when I apply it before getting into bed at night.The jar doesn't hold too much, but you use very little with each application. And the 2-Pack is more economical than buying one at a time at a retail store.A good product at a fair price.",5,I think it really helps....,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",0.4889

4,A160UTNX4JIPQZ,B0000530O9,Lee,"[0, 0]",Sorry I purchased so much of this product... when you apply it ...it looks shiny on...so you can't use it during the day when you need for the puffiness to be reduced. I will use it at night... and never buy it again.,2,Too shiny,1376784000,"08 18, 2013",-0.0386

6,A3NLK7LJ6KGYOS,B0000530O9,Paul Irwin,"[1, 1]","A total waste of money (though it's pretty cheap). I don't know what the rave with this eye gel is all about. The gel is quite thick and hard to spread. It's shiny and does not get absorbed quickly. Two or three days after I used this eye gel once at night, both my eyes look more puffy and tired-looking. An, for an unknown reason, my eyes are rheum-filled each morning when I woke up after using this. Disgusting.",1,Eyes look more puffy,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",-0.0954

9,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B0000530O9,Stephanie De Pue,"[0, 1]","Olay Age Defying Classic Eye Gel. This popularly-priced product by Olay claims that it is a soothing, cooling gel that will revitalize and moisturize the eye area to minimize the appearance of signs of aging, and that it will work on normal, dry, combination/oily, oily skin. It will, the manufacturers state, replenish moisture in the eye area, helping to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles, or puffy areas. It contains a rather odd list of ingredients, old-fashioned witch hazel, cucumber extract,, fruit extract and flower oil, as well as variations on glycol/glycerine,B Vitamins, and some more advanced ingredients. The makers advise that it should be dotted around the eye area and smoothed in until absorbed.I know it has nothing to do with the important issues of the day, but I have gone through years of problems in my eye area: redness, swelling, tearing up, sparse lashes, and have tried most eye creams out there, I think, from drug store price to department store price to cosmoceutical. I actually tried two bottles of this product, and found its effects to be odd indeed. On the one hand it did feel comfortingly cool. But it did not feel rich and emollient enough; and it further upset the sensitive skin of my eye area. Not recommended.",1,Not Rich and Emollient Enough; Upset the Skin of My Eye Area,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",-0.0319
