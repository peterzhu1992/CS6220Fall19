Then I realized you can buy it in liquid form. GREAT stuff. It is hard to find but it smells better and it has a pump which is awesome!",4,Get it in liquid form,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",0.351

4,A2F09EWKV3MTO2,B000052YLX,StillWaters,"[0, 0]","As someone who has battled acne in the past and still gets occasional breakouts, I learned over time that the beauty companies will keep coming out with their new facial cleaners that are supposed to do some new thing that all the other previous facial cleansers didn't do. The cleansers that were advertised as for acne always made my acne worse, especially if they had salicylic acid. This is a basic facial cleanser that does everything you need. Personally I don't want to wash my face every single day with a cleanser full of chemicals. The 6 ounce bar of this is a great value and lasts a long time. The only thing to be careful about with this bar is that it can be a little drying. Make sure you don't use too much, and I always use a moisturizer. I use once a day before bed.",5,Simple facial cleansing bar,1308614400,"06 21, 2011",0.1346
