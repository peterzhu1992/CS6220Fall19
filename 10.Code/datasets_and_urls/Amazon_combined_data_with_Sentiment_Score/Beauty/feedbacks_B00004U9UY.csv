Just the right size to leave at the office as well or in my purse.",5,Best hand cream - and I NEVER used hand cream before this.,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",0.3276
2,A3AZI828WJN1CD,B00004U9UY,Becky in NOLA Becky,"[0, 0]","I have used several Crabtree and Evelyn hand creams and this is probably my least favorite because of the scent. As a moisturizer it works great, especially around the nails and fingertips where my hands get dry and crack. The hand therapy goes on very smooth and non greasy but the scent is very strong and spicy, it reminds me of a man's cologne or aftershave.",4,Great for dry hands but strong almost masculine smell,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",0.5325
3,ACUGBCEADYT6D,B00004U9UY,booklass Passionate bibliophile.,"[0, 0]","The smell is too strong on this lotion. I prefer the lighter scents without the eucalyptus or whatever the strong smell is. It DOES soften, but so does the rose, or the Nantucket Briar, and the smell on those is so pretty. Those do not burn if I accidentally get them in my eyes, either. (Within reason).",3,"Smell is too strong, but does soften hands",1402617600,"06 13, 2014",0.2902

It is such a great, clean scent-not overpowering and the staying power on your hands is amazing-your hands (feet too!) really feel wonderful after lotion is applied!",5,Love this scent so much :),1386115200,"12 4, 2013",0.6999
5,A14VNXS7M0JO5K,B00004U9UY,Eleanor Gilpatrick egilpatr,"[0, 0]","I bought this because I identify with what happens to gardeners' hands. I love the way it goes on, but I am not very happy with the scent; and the tube does not stand up, so I have to keep it in its box in order to keep it standing in the place I keep this sort of thing. But I DO like the way my hands feel.",4,Almost perfect,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",0.032
6,AMV9D5D7VOCO6,B00004U9UY,Janet,"[0, 0]",I love Crabtree & Evelyn. It really does wonders in keeping your hands moisturized. It smells fantastic as well. The aluminum bottle helps protect the lotion from damage from the heat or the sun's rays. The small compact size makes it portable.,5,Great Lotion,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",0.3155
7,A3VU2J7G0U35AU,B00004U9UY,Jaybird,"[1, 1]","I've been using this creme for about 20 years now. It's amazing stuff. It's gotten my hands and forearms (and feet sometimes) through 84 rose bushes, countless tree prunings, landscape rehabbing, etc. I have found that even with cuts and scratches, this lotion never stings. All the herbs probably have an antiseptic effect on injuries, but who knows.The scent is wonderful too, at least I think so. Quite unique and natural, but not overpowering.Since the creme is very concentrated, I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs, etc. A little goes a LONG way! :0So glad they keep making this great product!PJ",5,Nothing Works Like it....or Smells Like it!

9,A287547UH1VBJ7,B00004U9UY,K. Smith,"[0, 0]","I bought this based on other reviews. It smells great and feels great. I out it in every night before bedtime. However, my hands are dry when i wake up. Will not buy again, but works well enough to finish the tube. Maybe i am supoosed to usemore frequently?",4,Good,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",0.2067
10,ASXPNU896V9I8,B00004U9UY,L90,"[0, 0]","I have dry hands, as my job requires me to wash them very often. I have very sensitive skin/allergies, and tend to avoid anything with strong fragrances. This is my favorite moisturizer; it has a definite scent, but it's not floral or cloying at all. Most importantly, this rubs right in and leaves hands moisturized without any stickiness.",5,Best hand lotion,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",0.2563
11,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B00004U9UY,PT Cruiser,"[1, 1]","This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes. The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized. This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years. It also makes a nice gift in a basket with a pair ofAngela's Garden 7120-921 Kids Garden Glove, Honey Bee, a hand gardening tool and a couple packets of seeds. The people I have given it to tell me that it's become one of their favorites too. Everyone seems to like it's nice clean smell.",5,An effective hand cream with a wonderful scent,1238544000,"04 1, 2009",0.5144
12,A2SX3JU39YE2TP,B00004U9UY,Summer Haven,"[0, 0]","I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become. I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden (or washing dishes in the sink, if you're old-fashioned like me). I have purchased many as gifts for others. This size (100g) is a generous tube and will last a long time. I gave it four stars only because it is more expensive here than at the Crabtree & Evelyn outlet store - or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time. Truth is, I'll buy it wherever I can find it.",4,"Wonderful feel, wonderful fragrance",1374192000,"07 19, 2013",0.4687
