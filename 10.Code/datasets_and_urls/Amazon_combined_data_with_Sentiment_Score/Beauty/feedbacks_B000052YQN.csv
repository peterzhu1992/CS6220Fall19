Its slightly greasy so i always was my face afterwards with soap to take the oily residue off.",5,Excellent eye make up remover!,1393804800,"03 3, 2014",0.143
1,A1CANGVKCCXCHG,B000052YQN,amy,"[0, 0]",I used to use this as a teenager but for some reason stopped. I've been using covergirl foundation over olay face cream for years but for some reason my face started breaking out recently. So I bought a bottle of this and my face cleared right up and I don't even need the olay cream because this cold cream moisturizes my face plenty,5,love it,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",-0.0755
2,ARSQ2F9U315WG,B000052YQN,Biblioholic Beth,"[3, 4]","I have horribly dry and sensitive skin that freaks out every time the seasons change. This year, as winter was arriving, has been the worst - too much unusual dry and cold weather. So, my face felt like it had been put through a meatgrinder (and kinda looked that way too - red, blotchy, flaky...). I have spent a small fortune on skincare over my 35 years - more in the last 10 as things have gotten progressively worse. I have tried all-natural solutions, expensive stuff, drugstore stuff...some work for a short while and then stop, some don't work at all. Some are great for sensitive, but don't do enough for dry - some are great for dry but sting when I put them on.Anyway - out of desperation this year, I thought I would try this (as well as the lotion). It has been WONDERFUL! My face looks better than it has in months - it is soothing and moisturizing, without being too heavy or leaving me with those crazy red bumps that some products are prone to. I have been using the combo for about a month, and so far have had no problems.I use it 2x a day, putting about a teaspoon on my face and massaging for a minute or two. I then wipe it off with a warm damp washcloth. I follow it with the lotion and I am good. At night, I just use extra.I can't say enough good things about this combo. I finally feel like my skin is reasonably normal - hopefully, this can be a keeper!",4,Wonderful for extremely dry/sensitive skin!,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",0.0913
3,A348IT6M7H8A67,B000052YQN,Bufster3,"[2, 5]",I don't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser. I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream. It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either. I don't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product. It's really too bad because it is a good price and I can't afford more expensive products.,2,"Strong perfume frangrance, did not remove mascara",1291075200,"11 30, 2010",-0.2377

7,A25W8AK3G4LUWW,B000052YQN,ELY Lovu,"[4, 8]","I admit I havent tried this but I don't have to in order to know it only derserves ONE star! I have been researching skin care products trying to find out what the ingredients actually are because I am looking for the perfect face wash/moisturizer for my skin. I have gotten so tired of reading labels and having no idea what I am about to be putting on my skin (and as a result, into my bloodstream) I have sensitive skin which happens to also be acne-prone and have had a really difficult time with trial & error on different skin care products. TIRED of wasting money! I want something affordable AND safe! Is this too much to ask???I loved the idea of this cream and was really wanting to give it a try until I got to the 5th ingredient in this product list- Triethanolamine. After a little research on this ingredient I need not go any further with my Ponds Cold Cream research and will not be using this product!!! Here [...] a link to the alarming article I found on this ingredient:I would rather not risk it & if you read the facts on it you probably won't either!If ANYONE out there has any recommendations for skin products that are mostly natural & non-comedogenic (I mean ALL the ingredients are)(NO salicylic acid or any other FOR acne (DRYING) agents in them,I am open!PS-SOMEONE please create a fragrance-FREE, all natural, non-comedogenic, NON-drying face wash that also serves as a moisturizer (as cold cream does)!Thanks!",1,Bad ingredients!,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",0.1558
8,A334RGRFRWKC92,B000052YQN,erin,"[3, 4]","All my life I've heard about how horrible mineral oil is so I've just avoided it. It turns out my skin loves the stuff. I started washing my face with this after using a cream wash overseas that I could not find in the US. I had noticed that some eczema which I could not get to clear up started getting better after using cleansing cream as my face wash. I was put out by the heavy rose geranium scent (though if they use rose geranium oil it's probably not so bad for the skin), but I find this does a great job of dissolving makeup and grease while leaving my skin soft.I've tried the oil cleansing method before with a lot of success so I understand how oil can clean the skin well. However, I found the oil cleansing method to much trouble to keep up with. Cleansing cream dissolves just a little faster and easier and requires less heat on my face, which is good.I find just rubbing this in is pleasant, and then washing it off with a warm rag is good enough to leave my skin very clean but soft.I have not seen any increase in breakouts after using this, myself. I'm very happy with the product and see why it's been around so long.",5,Mineral Oil!?,1304812800,"05 8, 2011",0.2222

Sadly, they have changed the ingredients. It is loaded with chemicals now and I will not put them on my skin. If it helps any, I now cleanse with pure coconut oil, using same procedure! Hope my sharing helps you.God bless.********************************************************Now I know why my grandmother swore by cold cream! If you have DRY skin this is hands down THE BEST moisturizing cleanser on the market.Recently I've have had to change my skincare routine because my skin is now DRY instead of normal. I've been searching for products to both make my skin look radiant and to actually improve it. I have found my cleanser: PONDS COLD CREAM. Who would have thought?PROCEDURE:I use Ponds to clean my face/take off my makeup in the evening.After applying it to my face I use several tissues or a damp cloth to take it off.NOTE: I've noticed that my skin stays more dewey if I use tissues.IMPORTANT: If you're wearing mascara it WILL get a bit messy! (You may prefer to use an eye makeup remover - I don't.)RESULTS:My skin looks moist and I could NOT be happier.I hope you have as great of results as I did!

I've got dry skin specially because I live in a dry climate. After washing my face, it would be greasy looking in less than an hour. I realized my skin was too dry and it was overcompensating. The area around my eyes has drastically improved and my skin isn't as greasy looking.Since using this product for a few months, it does clog my skin. I now only use it around my eyes, cleaning gently with a washcloth. I have seen a big difference in keeping the area around my eyes moisterized.",4,Very moisturizing,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",0.0576
14,A1G8MLYQA0N86A,B000052YQN,Kimberly N. Phillips kims121,"[0, 0]",This is a basic make-up remover. I forgot how thick it is. It does a good job at removing my make-up. You need to wipe it off with a face cloth or wet wipe to remove. It will not come off with just a water splash. It leaves my skin soft and dewey. I would recommend to you if you like the extra removal step. You wil need to follow with a toner to completely remove the residue from your skin.

It feels very mild and nice on my face. Everybody was raving about the smell, so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother's perfume. It's not a bad smell at all, though. The cream takes my make-up off nicely, even tough liquid liner. I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is, but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever. You only need a very small amount to do the trick.
