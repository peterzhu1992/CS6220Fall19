Cuts through heavy duty mascara, liner, shadow, you name it (I've used it on stubborn lip stains). You will have to wipe/clean the oil off your lids and lashes if you want to reapply makeup after using this. If you DO need to reapply after using remover, you should consider a water-based makeup remover that will evaporate so you don't have to worry about oil residue causing your makeup to slip off. Usually I remove my makeup at the end of the day before bathing and don't reapply makeup until the next day, so the oil doesn't bother me. Will repurchase.",5,Does what it claims.,1308441600,"06 19, 2011",-0.0312

5,AL084VOAU6E3C,B000052WYL,Debbie G.,"[0, 0]",this gets off those fiber water proof mascaras that you would typically need sand paper to take off. I put it on before I wash my face and it comes right off. I don't use tissue or cotton to wipe it off because I feel like it will take a lash with it. But that's just me.,5,work really well.,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",0.0903
6,A2CECLRFH55F8H,B000052WYL,D,"[3, 3]","I usually use Avon's make up remover to take off my waterproof mascara and liner, but I find myself unhappy with the results. I was running out of the Avon remover and wanted something different to replace it, so I popped on to Amazon to see what was available. I ended up buying this make up remover based on the price and reviews and I'm actually really happy with my purchase!Here are a few things I've found about this make up remover:*The bottle is about the size of the palm of my hand*Fragrance-free*Great price, especially the subscribe and save*The product is an oil, which can be a little messy*It is very moisturizing, which I love!*If you plan on putting make up on after using this make sure to get every trace of oil off of your eyelid and eyelashes or your new/fresh make up won't stick*I squirt this remover onto a cotton pad or cotton ball and gentle wiggle it back and forth on my eye to remove my liner and mascara, the make up slips off easily. I tightline my eyes so sometimes that liner doesn't come off with just wiping the cotton ball downwards, which is why I wiggle the cotton ball around on my eye*After using this product I wash my face normally, and make sure to rinse around my eye area to remove the remaining make up remover*A little goes a long way*Didn't hurt too bad when I accidentally got it in my eye (I accidentally got Avon's eye make up remover in my eye and it was awful)I definitely will be repurchasing this product, it's wonderful. I've found my new favorite eye make up remover, sorry Avon!",4,Good stuff!,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",0.4261

9,A2FN4ABZQRR9GE,B000052WYL,Jade Robinson,"[0, 0]","It does remove most of my eye makeup but not all. When I use it, it seems to remove it all but then I wash my face and see black mascara rings under my eyes. I'm using as directed, so I feel it's not that effective. Also, it is moisturizing but too 'oily' for me. I find myself wiping my eyes on my face towel but still feel a residue around my eyes. I think it's all right but I wouldn't purchase again. Almay's makeup remover pads did a much better job but they were somewhat drying ... so I'm still on the lookout for an ideal mascara remover",2,It's all right,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",0.0556

18,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000052WYL,Rebecca of Amazon The Rebecca Review,"[4, 4]",If you are looking for a makeup remover that removes waterproof mascara this works great. It is oily so you only need a tiny amount on a cotton ball or pad. After wiping off all the mascara I recommend that you wash your face and areas around your eyes with a liquid soap you'd use to clean your face normally. Then splash a lot of water around your eyes especially so there is no oily residue left. If you don't do this the oil can be slightly irritating and may make your eyes feel itchy. So make sure to remove the remover and you should have less problems.~The Rebecca Review,4,Effective,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",0.1165
19,A2EK2IAJ4FHTZP,B000052WYL,Sarah,"[0, 0]","It was only OK because yes, it takes make up off great, but it's very oily. So when you rub it on your eye lids, and say you don't completely take all your eye make up off on accident, it will rub off when you try to put a different make up on because it's oily. I would rather buy a store brand non oily one I think",3,OK but very Oily,1384819200,"11 19, 2013",0.0598

When it arrived I find out that this product is essentially just unscented mineral oil. It works and I'll use it until it's gone but I'll go back to using coconut oil when it's gone.
