I tried Nioxin, and all it did was burn my scalp and make my hair feel dry and brittle. I had tried T/Sal a long time ago without any adverse effects. I went back to it, and I'm STILL in love with it! No burning, itching, or other adverse effects. (It doesn't strip my hair either!)My scalp is actually sun burnt right now and it didn't even agitate the burn when I applied it.",5,Sooo much better than Nioxin!,1335657600,"04 29, 2012",0.0974

3,A22NH69NM8JHG0,B000052XZX,Carmen G.,"[1, 1]","I very badly want to leave this product a good review, but in the interest of honesty, here goes...I bought this shampoo solely on the basis of excellent reviews. Many of the reviewers mentioned this product's ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp. This was my concern too. A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair (not my scalp) feel really really clean- it would even squeak when I would squeeze out the water, post-shower. So, I was excited about how well it worked and how quickly.But I noticed within a day of using it that I now had a problem I never had before: flakes! So many of them, and so disgustingly visible! Further, after a day of washing, my scalp got extremely oily- more so than it did before. Still, I've been using it and giving it a chance, at least until I am done with this entire (small) bottle.I am about half way through the bottle, washing my hair every other day, and have experienced the same results consistently. However, I will use it until the bottle is empty, and if results change, I will update this review. I am hoping the negative results are just an initial reaction to new treatment. If anyone else has had this reaction and wants to share any tips, I'm all ears!",2,Caused new problem: flakey hair! And more oil than before.,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",0.1633

I definitely have noticed reduced flakes with this. As a shampoo, it's more medicinal - it doesn't smell great, doesn't have a smooth luxurious texture...but it does what it says so, I guess I have to reduce my complaining :)",4,"Small bottle for the price, but otherwise great",1362268800,"03 3, 2013",0.1744

I normally have an oily, itchy scalp with buildup, and I notice that I have no itching afer using the T/Sal for a month. I wash first with Nature's Gate Tea Tree shampoo, then wash once with T/Sal (leaving on for several minutes), then condition with Nature's Gate Tea Tree conditioner.I initially bought both the T/Sal and T/Gel, so I used the T/Gel last night, and I notice I have a little itching today. I will update my review after I've used the bottle, but I already prefer the T/Sal.Update: after using the T/Gel for a few weeks, I do not have itching, but I have a dry, flaky scalp, which I did not have before. I will gladly be switching back to T/Sal.",5,Works for me,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",0.0909
8,AS2J6F9MTSDMK,B000052XZX,Gabriela Diaz,"[3, 4]","During the past two years I've been struggling with some scalp build up problems and I pretty much have purchased all the drugstore products I could find to solve this. After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes, it did start to get better right away. However, it wasn't as quick of a process as I wanted it to be so I decided to buy Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength and use it combined with this and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days. Since I've done that I haven't had any problems, my scalp is super clear and I couldn't be any more please. I never really stopped using this product and I don't plan on doing it but just keep in mind that this product by itself didn't really do too much. In terms of the smell I don't really like it, but it's nothing intolerable or disgusting.",4,"Works great, just not by itself!",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",0.4802

10,A3VU2J7G0U35AU,B000052XZX,Jaybird,"[0, 0]","When my dermatologist was doing a skin cancer screening on me a few years ago, I was surprised when she said I had a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis. This made sense to me, though, as my scalp could get flaky and a little itchy at times. She recommended T/Sal. I figured, oh, great....I have to use a medicated shampoo now. I bet it will smell weird and dry out my hair.Well, not only does it smell like nothing, it works really well on my flaky/itchy issue, and to my shock and joy, it is not only gentle on my hair, but makes it super shiny and full. I would go as far as to say it is my favorite shampoo, period. Not my favorite medicated shampoo, just a great all 'round shampoo for everyone.I also use my wonderful Br&ouml;&ouml; beer shampoo, but I have found that the T/Sal even makes that work better too. I shampoo first with the T/Sal, then once with the Br&ouml;&ouml;. They are both free of harsh sulfates and the T/Sal is surprisingly simple in its ingredients. I believe the salicylic acid must be cutting any residue on my hair and so, making it behave better. T/Sal seems to make all my other shampoos and conditioners work better. I used to use Neutrogena's build up removing shampoo, but found it too harsh (sulfates) and too pungent. The T/Sal is far superior.This is a great shampoo if you have a &#34;reason&#34; to use it, and even if you don't . Gentle, mild, fragrance-free, powerful stuff.",5,"Soothes Scalp, Removes Build-Up, Major Shine",1403481600,"06 23, 2014",0.2429
11,A1DHKKNNW6H783,B000052XZX,Justbooking,"[3, 4]","My two-year old toddler has suffered from bad scalp eczema for most of her life, with scaly itchy lesions that she would scratch to the point of bleeding. I've tried all baby shampoos on the market (Johnson and Johnson, Aveeno, California Baby, Mustela) and none helped.A few months ago I discovered thatDove Bar Soap, Sensitive Skin Unscented, 4 Ounce, 16 Counthad been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin, which doctors thought was atypical eczema. After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.I wondered if the detergent (surfuctant) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response. I knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies, so I tried a small amount (quarter size) ofNeutrogena T/Sal Shampoo, Scalp Build-up Control, 4.5 fl ozon her, left it on for five minutes, rinsed well and reapplied, leaving it on for another five minutes. I thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried and it was very soft and wavy; a dime size dab ofAveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream, 5 Ounceworked through her hair and scalp, a spray of water and some scrunching is all that's needed to form ringlets that hold all day. Her scalp cleared up in less than a week, and although she isn't cured - it comes back if I don't use it on her - I'm glad to finally have found a solution.I use T-Sal once or twice a week on her, if any scales reappear - otherwise, I useBella B Bee Gone Cradle Cap Baby Shampoo 8 Oz. This shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn't caused any issues. Both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.On my end, I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in hydrating shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage. Before trying T-Sal on my children, I tried it on my wavy hair. I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards. I've also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such asDial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent, 100oz Bottle, (Pack of 4)), if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.I now use T-Sal to help remove product build up and alternate withDHS Clear Shampoo 16 ozandDHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol, Fragrance Free 8 fl oz (236 ml), both very mild no-frills products that work really well.The only thing I don't like is the small size. I've bought a large size T-Gel to see if it's more cost effective and will report back after I try it.",5,Healed scalp eczema in just one week,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",0.2651
12,AIQU2L38AS930,B000052XZX,lady truth,"[4, 5]","I had bought this shampoo because my skin would easily become flaky after cleansing both hair and scalp. All I had to do was wet my sectioned hair and scalp and apply a dime-size amount of the shampoo and lather. Leave the shampoo on for at least 3 minutes. I leave it on until I have applied to every section part of hair and after rubbing gently my scalp to remove the scalp flakes. Then I will reapply, and sometimes, I will add an essential oil that can assist the shampoo. I like this shampoo because it works well for my scalp and it cleanses both my hair and scalp. It helps also with detangling my hair, so that is a great help. The shampoos scent is light, nearly nonexistent. I think if the shampoo doesn't work well at first, then combine it with essential oils like tea tree oil, cedarwood oil, neem oil, karanja oil, peppermint oil, and other oils that fight fungus and balances sebum of the scalp like ylang ylang essential oil.

It's not great for color-treated hair, but as long as it's used only occasionally, like once a week or every once in a while, and in conjunction with conditioner, then it isn't too drying. Over all, it's a beneficial shampoo that has stood the test of time.",4,A Good Addition to the Regimen,1341273600,"07 3, 2012",0.4714
