I bought this along with it the first time. Unfortunately, I'm highly chemically sensitive and couldn't use this product because it still has a chemical smell. The shampoo has no discernible smell to me.",1,"Unfortunately, still has a chemical smell",1289001600,"11 6, 2010",0.0605

4,A1D7BE64YN2U66,B000052Y25,VickiO VOS,"[1, 2]",The product arrived on time from shipper. Over all I like the product. I have sensitive allergy prone skin and after using the DHS Clear shampoo and this conditioner my allergy is gone. I think DHS should remove the yellow dye from this product so that it would be more allergy free. I have allergies to some dyes. So far I'm doing well with the product.,4,DHS Conditioning Rinse with panthenol,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",0.2617
