Won't be going back to those!Here are my impressions of using the Instead Softcup.Do not try to do this in a public bathroom--it's too difficult (messy) and may not be sanitary. And because these cups can be used for 12 hours, in my case, I was always home to do my changes.Follow the instructions! Read them twice.I found I didn't have a hard time inserting the soft cup, but getting it out was another thing. Make sure your hands are clean and if you are having a hard time inserting your finger and pulling out the ring you need to RELAX.The first time I pulled it out (after a lot of sweating), I made a mess trying to empty it out and dispose of it. By the third one, I was more prepared. After emptying the cup, I wrap it in toilet paper and then place it in a small plastic bag. If you have small plastic bags to reuse then put them in the bathroom where you will be doing your changes.If you insert it correctly, you will not feel anything there. If you have problems inserting due to dryness, then try some lubricating gel. The cup was so comfortable for me that I had to remind myself when I needed to change it.I had one time that it leaked. It was on the second day of my period (the heaviest day for me) and I had a cold. I coughed and coughed and suddenly, yep, you guessed it, I felt a warm gush--good thing I was home. Like I said in the beginning--READ the Instructions. I should have been changing it every four hours--it was about six hours that I had it in. So that leakage was my fault (operator error) ;-).I wish I had known about this product while I was going to school--would have made me a lot happier not to mess with pads and tampons at school.",4,Not for Everyone,1258502400,"11 18, 2009",0.0761
1,A3NLW5OKL2FGMB,B0000533CC,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",I have been wanting to try a menstrual cup out but was hesitant. I decided to try these rather than the diva cup or reusable ones. I like the fact I can just throw it away. I was surprised I actually like this product!When inserting push back and down not up. I have not had a leak with this technique. I have not had any issues with it coming out. If you bear down too hard it might come out though. I put the garbage can right in front of me when taking the cup out. I really don't think it's messy at all. I pull it out slowly and am careful not to spill. You will obviously get blood on your fingers but you could put gloves on if it bothers you. I have not tried taking out or inserting a new cup in a public restroom. I would rather do this at home. It is really nice not having to worry about changing a tampon all the time!,5,Wow!

2,A380S0FSWNY6QK,B0000533CC,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Thanks to all the reviewers that have shared with candid honesty... I found them to be very helpful before buying this product. I'll try to do the same, hoping someone will find it helpful.This product was definately a godsend for me, but it's definately not for everyone. My sister, for one, would have tried it once and said, Yeah, good luck with that one.... But I was deturmined to give it a chance because I no longer find tampons comfortable, and frankly end up wasting a lot of them because I think they need a change and then find that they don't and it's not like you can put those back in. I really liked how this product gave me the comfort of feeling clean and dry when I was wearing it, yet I could take it out and clean it and put it back in. Talk about reducing waste! One of these could easily last an entire period. I still wear a decent panty liner or super thin pad as a back up (like Always Dry Weave, which would give me time if I needed to get to a bathroom) but at least I get to feel clean and dry while wearing it, as opposed to having to sit in the 'stuff' I'm menstruating. Also, I use to have a terrible time sleeping with a sanitary pad because I would get woken up by the sensation of the blood trickling gravity-style downward while I wondered if I was sufficiently covered to not stain the bed. Such a hassle and lots of restless sleep. The Instead allows me to not be awakened by that, yet not have to deal with tampons that never lasted all night anyway. So, now for the down side. It's a bit tricky getting used to insertion and I'm not so sure the one size fits all. It feels like it's a bit big around, but maybe it would leak if it weren't so. I love how flexible and bendable it is and it's not bulky. After trying this I KNOW I could never use one of the non-desposable bulkier Diva type models with a stem to grab. The Instead seems much more user friendly compared to those.The ideal bathroom would have a sink right next to the toilet so you could remove the Instead, rinse it and re-insert it. Or better yet, do it in the shower! But that's not usually the location you'll find yourself in. Oddly, I found that many times I didn't actually need to remove it! Something about the position of crouching over the seat in a public bathroom seems to lend to enabling the Instead to purge it's contents into the toilet without me actually needing to remove the thing. Odd, but hey, who was I to look a gift horse in the mouth? I just made sure it was situated back how it should be before finishing my business. Once, I did remove it in a public bathroom and wiped it down with a flat wad of toilet paper before re-inserting it. Gross, yes, but then so are pads with clots in them that I have to sit on until the next change, so it's a trade off. Ahh the joys of womanhood. I don't think I ever washed my hands so much before and after entering the bathroom until purchasing this product. So there's always an up side to everything. I think every woman should try these to see if they'll work for them. I wish I had found these 20 years ago. I bought a box of 24 and plan to give one to my niece and another to a close friend just so they can try it and see if it'll work for them and make their lives easier. It's definately better than the alturnatives if you can make it work. Good luck ladies!",4,"Like it, but definately NOT for everyone.",1317427200,"10 1, 2011",0.2303
3,A3EN1BBHJ7MU9X,B0000533CC,Ash,"[0, 0]","Okay,,, so tmi review! Seriously!This product works perfect for days 3-5! It's amazing! I wore it on the airplane, used it during intercourse, and no blood at all! But it really lacks in the first two days when I have a heavy cycle. Not surprised. I would suggest maybe wearing at least a panty liner or doing what you regularly do for your time of the month.Out of all of the options (tampons, pads, softcups) it's is soo comfortable. Let's be honest, pads feel like a weird diaper (and I always feel like I smell with pads) and tampons can be a pain to get in especially when you're cramping!I feel like you definitely have to be familiar with your body and comfortable with it to put it in. You have to stick it a little bit back in there. It's more complex then a pad or tampon. But it really is amazing! Clean up is probably the worse of all options. You have to pull the softcup back out and it acted as a bucket for the blood (meaning you're pulling a pool of blood out). It can be messy and awkward to dispose of in a plublic restroom. Lot's of TP needed!So idk... it ultimately depends on what you like to deal with during you're period. I wish females didn't have a period!I would recommend anyone to give it a one time try! :DPS never writing a review for a &#34;feminine product&#34; again.

They may take a little practice to insert, but it can be done. I recommend using a little bit of lube to make it easier. Sometimes they like to tilt the wrong way, but overall I like having these on hand. I don't know why they are so hard to find at the store.",4,A must for swimmers,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",0.2792

However, getting it in place can be tricky and removal is best done in the shower. Actually insertion might be best done in the shower where you can squat down and get it in there correctly then wash off any mess left behind. Feels clean and comfortable when properly placed, you forget it is even there. Make sure to change every twelve hours though.

6,A1HC0DV6RF4PJ2,B0000533CC,cutenerd,"[3, 4]",Alright so I am going to be extremely open in this review. If you or any other female you know are in a wheelchair it makes that time of month even more unpleasant.I was using a large overnight pad and the super+ tampons and well when you bend over in a wheelchair it creates a very uncomfortable.. squish... and it was not working and making me miserable.Now I still use a pad to catch accidental leaks since sitting doesnt allow for natural gravity flow. But with this product I can actually feel like I am able to go out of the house during that week each month. I don't worry about what if I bend over.Pro's: not recommended but i have used over 12hrs and it worked great. use longer at your own risk since there is little research with TSS and these.less smelleasy for those with less dexterity (i couldnt use diva cup cuz i have issues with my hands and folding it while inserting was impossible)sanitary just throw outcons:takes time to get used tocan be messy to remove but better after practicei think its only cuz i sit in a wheelchair but it sometimes sits on my urethra and after 8hrs hurts/makes me really have to pee.great product. i recommend to all!,5,Must have for handicapped!,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",0.4363

It definitely takes some proper placement technique but I'm getting better and better at it and managed to breeze through the wedding without any problems.

8,A1KEPD71NTGA5H,B0000533CC,Gina L. Lyles,"[0, 0]","I know there are some very long reviews about these. Here are my suggestions:1) watch the Youtube video and read other blogs/reviews on how to put them in. I had success my first time using and I think the extra research helped.2) I do feel pressure; it isn't true for me that you don't feel anything. I don't seem to have any extra cramping or discomfort other then feeling pressure in my lower, lower abdominal area though.3) I suggest taking these out in the shower if you can or follow the directions about using a medical glove so you have something to put it in to throw it away.I bought these mainly to use for intimacy during that time of the month and for that purpose these have worked great. I don't use these exclusively and still use tampons/pads as well.

So I was excited to try them. But it wasn't at all what I was expecting. I don't want to get into vivid details. But basically, I was not warned that this would be such a MESSY ordeal. Not to mention it's not at all convenient. I do not want to leave it in for too long, because if I do, I know it's not absorbing any fluid, so I worry about leakage, or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when I try to take it out. GROSS! Also, the thing itself is absolutely huge. I imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies. I believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods. Sorry, but I've got to switch back.",1,I'm sorry but this is GROSS!,1307318400,"06 6, 2011",-0.0132

It took a few tries before I got it in place.( I have a injured back so there's not a whole lot I can do. ) I would stay in place for about three hours and then I would have to push it back in place. I still think it would be better if them did come in different sizes because I do feel it is to big. It might just be me cause I haven't had any kids.,3,Not a big fan,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",0.0055

I've tried two different brands of menstrual cups, both of which were a challenge to remove! With Softcup, they're super easy to insert and remove. And while they're not reusable like menstrual cups, they hold just as much and, frankly, I don't want to bother having to wash one. The fact that they're disposable make them really convenient. Once they're in, I can't feel them at all, and they don't press on my urethra like menstrual cups do, so it's no problem to pee with them in.

I thought since I had liked the other brand this would be much the same way... it wasn't I don't know how many times I tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher/lower inside the vaginal walls, I couldn't stop the cup from leaking. It wasn't horrible, but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that I wasn't saving money on this alternative item and that I won't be using the brand again.

I read the back of the box and saw the informational video on their website prior to use so I would know exactly how to insert and remove the softcup. However, I could never actually get the cup in the proper place!Instead is supposed to be inserted completely into the vagina with the end of the cup's rim touching the back of the vagina and resting just under the cervix. The front of the cup's rim is supposed to be pushed up gently behind the pubic bone so that it stay in place. However, I have small hands and short fingers and could only just BARELY push the rim and position it behind the pubic bone. Or so I thought. Perhaps my anatomy doesn't hold the cup in place as securely as it's supposed to (according to the video), but throughout the day the cup would continually dislodge and would not catch everything it was supposed to. Instead only caught maybe 50% of the blood, and I would spot the rest.I think this may be a really great product for someone else, but I think I'll stick with regular tampons.",2,Too Short,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",0.1994

You can use them all day or all night easily, and I only change them at 12 hour intervals because the instructions say to, not because it's really necessary. As others have said, you can definitely clean them off and use them again, so I tend to use one for all day, clean it, and then use it for all night, or vice versa. It's quite easy to clean the current one during your daily shower, and then move on with your life!I've occasionally noticed that if it slips a little out of position, it can put a bit of pressure on my bladder, but overall, these are super comfortable to wear, and I've never had a problem with leaks.

18,A2G35B0XBEVQTC,B0000533CC,The Wif,"[4, 4]","Last year I posted a comment on Jessica H's review (the first review here) basically thanking her for the update she posted about using the Softcup with an IUD. Finally after a year of waiting, pondering and pondering some more I tried it last night. I'm going to be completely honest I was extremely hesitant, not about assaulting my lady parts but already having the IUD and now throwing some other foreign device in the mix. If you have an IUD you'll remember for the first week or two your uterus would make an attempt to force your body to expel the IUD well when you use the Softcup a similar process will happen. A little background on me I have had my Paragard IUD for 3 years, I have a tilted uterus and I have had one child (vaginal birth). For me it was not to difficult to insert, I got it in on the 2nd attempt making sure to secure it behind the pelvic bone, I took 2 Aleve (to reduce the slight cramping) and went to bed, had no problems, discomfort or leakage overnight and I had just started my period. The Softcup will mold to your body and although the company says you won't feel it if it's inserted correctly but you will specifically if you have a tilted uterus even if it is inserted correctly. You will also feel it if you have a full bladder.Now here's the fun part, I seem to hear the most horror stories about taking it out. I took Jessica H's advice and just used a glove and used my middle finger to find the ring and I slowly pulled it forward and low and behold it came out with no problems. Once you start pulling your body will pretty much help by forcing it out. I emptied it and wrapped the glove around it and threw it away, it was not a messy or uncomfortable experience. In all honestly I think this device works fine with an IUD, however I would not try it unless you've had an IUD for at least a year. You just don't want to many new foreign objects in the lady parts at once.Part 2: I am on my second day and my heaviest day and I inserted at around 6:30 am and had to change around 2:45 pm, only to have to worry about changing 1 time at work on my heaviest day is unreal for me. The only downside was I forgot my glove so needless to say it was an adventure but I was able to grab the ring and pull it out with no problems. I was pretty confident in the product and my own insertion of it that I did not use any back up and I had no leaks the entire day. I can tell when I did remove it that it worked it's way a little further than when I inserted it which is a good thing. As it did exactly as it was supposed to do.I did lots of research (videos, Softcup website and forums) to read other's experiences and what they have done and product likes/dislikes. I suggest you read the instructions enclosed and you should be fine. As with every new product things will take time to use and perfect. Personally I like it and will continue to use it and I am completely sold on a product that nearly scared me to death I now think is the best thing to happen to me.",5,First time use with a Paragard IUD...,1384473600,"11 15, 2013",0.1846
