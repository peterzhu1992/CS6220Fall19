My favorite (very expensive) facial wash was discontinued, so I was back on the hunt. I finally decided to try this cleanser and LOVE it. Does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts. Cleans, but doesn't strip moisture. Give this one a try!",5,Great for sensative skin,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",0.3317

This is the ONLY cleanser I used that doesn't dry skin out, it adds moisture and my face feels very clean after using.

I could not be more pleased! I always thought my skin looked ok, but with this I actually love my skin! Not to sound vain, but I look in the mirror and just think about how good my skin looks now and I don't even wear coverup! IMO I think it makes me look younger too, but that could be wishful thinking! This does not have the consistency of a cleanser, it does seem more like a lotion, but don't let that dissaude you, it is really great on the skin!",5,Best. Cleanser.

4,A9O3V0446E8L0,B000052ZB2,J Stylin,"[2, 2]","I have dry, sensitive skin. I've tried a number of cleansers like this one (Cetaphil, Ponds cold cream, Boots cleansing lotion, etc.) and this one seems to work the best. It takes make up off well and doesn't leave behind a 'filmy' feeling if you just wipe off. If you do rinse with water, it doesn't leave you with a tight, squeeky-clean feeling. It really does leave your skin feeling moisturized and yet cleanses enough to get rid of the dirt and make-up! I'm very happy with this cleanser and will purchase again.",5,Gentle cleanser that cleans well,1307577600,"06 9, 2011",0.2643

6,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B000052ZB2,Leanne,"[21, 22]","When choosing skin care products, I usually follow the recommendations fromThe Skin Type Solutionor Paula Begoun'sDon't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me (Don't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me). This product is one of Paula's Picks for an overall excellent product, so I decided to try it when I needed to pick up a new cleanser.I have very sensitive skin, and this did burn slightly the first time I used it, but, since then, it has been fine. It also works great with a Clarisonic brush.Since, as of my writing this review, Amazon isn't including the ingredients list for this product, I wanted to include them here:Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetyl Ricinoleate, Isohexadecane, TEA-Cocoyl Glutamate, Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Stearyl Alcohol, Cetyl Alcohol, PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Bisabolol, Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract, Tocopheryl Acetate, Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate, Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate, Tetrasodium EDTA, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Triethanolamine, BHT, Geranium Maculatum Extract, Dipropylene Glycol, Phenoxyethanol, Propylparaben, MethylparabenThis is a great cleanser for the price, but I just wish that it were free of parabens. It's worth trying, though, if you have sensitive skin.",4,A Paula's Pick choice that is gentle for sensitive skin,1325980800,"01 8, 2012",0.5489
7,AV8Z6FP0WTDG8,B000052ZB2,Lindsey Shumate,"[0, 0]",This stuff is very good for sensitive and oily skin. It mositurizes as it cleans and doesnt strip your face or cause a red chemical rash afterwards. My skin was so happy a week after washing with this and moisturizing with the neutrogena oil free moisture.,5,Great cleanser for acne prone and oily skin.,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",0.3109

9,A3S73VLN1KOGEY,B000052ZB2,Ms. Sean Crenwelge,"[6, 7]","This is the first product I use in my regime; I follow up with Neutrogena On-The-Spot Acne Treatment Vanishing Cream and then Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer. I did a lot of research on products and I found this to be the best on the market (that of course is on the cheaper side). It is free of many of the chemicals that should NOT be in a cleanser and it is definitely a great buy. I do not buy this on Amazon, I usually just buy it at my local Walmart and buy one at a time, though buying it on here in bulk might not be a bad idea. When I go to the store I'll pay about $5 for just one, so it seems that a pack of 3 on here is overly priced. But anyways, it is a great product that does what is needs to do, clean the dirt off my face! I have sensitive skin so this is a great cleaner that doesn't turn my face red or anything. Also just a tip, I did a lot of research and if you didn't know, you are supposed to splash your face with warm water to open up your pores, dispense the cleanser in your hands and wash for 30-45 seconds, and rinse again with warm water. Be sure when you dry off your face you are NOT wiping your face, you need to pat it gently and let it air-dry for at least 5 minutes before you apply anything else to your face. When using this product once a day, maybe sometimes twice, it lasted me about 4 1/2 months, WOW! For $5, that sure is worth the money. So overall, a great buy, might suggest you buy them at your local Walmart because it seems to be cheaper than buying in bulk.",5,Great Cleanser,1305590400,"05 17, 2011",0.5331
