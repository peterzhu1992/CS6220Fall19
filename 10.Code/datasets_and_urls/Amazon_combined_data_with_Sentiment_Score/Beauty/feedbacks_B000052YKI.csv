0,A2VKZQDUL4096A,B000052YKI,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","This moisturizer is perfect if you live in part of the country that has cold, dry winters and you have combo skin that tends to breakout. I may be close to 30 but I suffer from combo skin and the occasional breakout like a teenager. I formerly used products that contained salicylic acid because it claims to clear up/prevent breakouts. Not for me. So in my continuous search for a miracle product I decided I would give this a whirl - the packaging just looked clean and simple - yes, I was hoping the packaging was an indicator of what the product would do to my skin - make it look clean. And that it did! This moisturizer was perfect for the Midwest winter months and into spring and even fall. However, it was a little too moisturizer for the Midwest, soupy summers (my skin was a little too dewey by the end of the day).Be sure to try out the Purpose Facial Cleanser with this product! It is just as amazing for combo, breakout-prone skin. And it's super affordable!",4,Right moisture for winter; too much moisture for summer.,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",0.3613
1,AS12AOZ971ZF1,B000052YKI,Demetria,"[1, 1]","These recent reviews are correct.I never tried the past formula but this one is no good.I didn't care for it the first couple times I tried it, but I had to give this another shot because my usual moisturizer ran out. I was slow in picking that one up because it's $15 (pretty pricey but oh so worth it). I should have just broke the bank because this stuff broke my face.I was wondering why I was breaking out more than usual. I typically break out along my lower cheeks, but it was spreading to my temples and forehead.I just bought my usual moisturizer yesterday, and I already see an improvement overnight. It's gonna take a couple weeks to get rid of the mess this caused, I'm sure.Seriously, try to look for a more natural product. Don't waste your time & money on this.On a good note for Purpose, I do use their gentle cleansing wash which is A-OK!",1,Pass This Up!,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",0.1082
2,A1BUXI30VSG51W,B000052YKI,Happy,"[1, 1]",I have been using Purpose products ever since I was a teen. I used to have acne and dry skin and needed a product that I could use to moisturize my face. Because my face is sensitive I would always break out but when the dermotologist recommended this product I was elated and am still using it to this day. It does what it needs to do to keep my face moisturized and looking young. I am 55 now and still have smooth beautiful skin. I recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin.,5,Purpose Products,1353715200,"11 24, 2012",0.3001
3,A1KHTR21SMTYMX,B000052YKI,P. Pantea,"[0, 0]",I've used this product for many years. A friend who had combination skin told about it and I've used it ever since. I have combination/oily skin and this product doesn't make me breakout. I only have to use it in the morning before I apply my pressed powder. This 4 oz bottle lasts me for months and I love the price. I've used very expensive moisturizers in the past and never had the success as I've had with this one.,5,Incredible product!,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",0.112
4,ACXCS6NRA4EVU,B000052YKI,Seattle girl,"[1, 2]","This lotion is the best that I've tried. It's lightweight, yet does the job of keeping my skin looking fresh and hydrated. I also love the fact that it has sun block in it. I use it in the morning and at night, and find that it works really well for me. It's a great product.",5,Great Lotion!,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",0.4473
5,A2JY33OP6OJMVO,B000052YKI,TMh,"[0, 0]","I have very oily skin that also gets extremely dry in the winter. I heard that this is a good moisturizer, even for those with oily skin. It absorbs very quickly and does not feel greasy. My skin does not feel dry after application. However, it does not seem to improve my oily skin and I think it would be too much for me to use in the summer.",3,"Non greasy, moisturizes well",1384387200,"11 14, 2013",0.0198
