I love that it gets their hair squeaky clean! The bathroom always smells great when they are done too~like fresh mountain strawberries!This product is very inexpensive and works like a charm!,4,Smells Great!,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",0.475
1,A22OWLY1J6XEH8,B0000530LV,Amy,"[1, 1]","Got this because of all the reviews. I now have this, the ocean one and the clarifier. It works just as well. Cleans thoroughly, smells nice for fruity days, and is a great body wash. I love how much lather it creates too, but all the Naturals do so. I use this when I'm not feeling oceany but want something sweet, and I use the apple conditioner with it. No build up, no fuss, just clean hair. I need conditioner though, as it's not a creamy formula--I don't like those anyway. If you like the basics, this is for you. Also, dirt cheap at the store, but I'd buy it here if that was a necessity. I do stray from Suave but always come back. Suave Naturals, I just don't know how to quit you.Anyone else do that? Try other products but then run back to what you really like? I don't know why I cheat, it never lasts. I'm definitely a Suave addict, although I won't tell a stylist that. I know I'd get in trouble.",5,another great suave story,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",0.1902

I've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little. Usually I'm a huge proponent of the 'you get what you pay for' way of thinking. However, there are exceptions that prove the rule, and this is one of them! I usually switch the variety each time I buy more just to keep things interesting, but aside from that, I've been pretty much using Suave for 15+ years.That said, I have short, uncomplicated hair that's only dislike is conditioner (it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason). I don't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit, so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long, curly hair. For a guy (or woman with short hair) this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to: clean my hair. It's worth trying even if you think you might not end up loving it, simply because it's inexpensive, so if it doesn't work out, you've lost nothing.For the price, I can't find a shampoo that is as good. This is straight up the least expensive but highest quality shampoo out there. Recommended to anyone without complicated hair, for use with kids, or as an alternative to more expensive shampoo that does exactly the same thing.",5,Sometimes you do get more than you pay for!,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",0.2991

When I use the strawberry shampoo together with Suave strawberry conditioner, my hair smells luscious, and people tell me so. I try other brands every now and then, but I always go back to Suave.",5,"Good quality, good price",1246752000,"07 5, 2009",0.6262
5,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B0000530LV,PeaTee,"[4, 4]","About the time my son turned four Johnson's baby shampoo - a household staple - began to fail us. It wasn't getting his and his older sister's hair clean and so I set about to find a replacement. Suave's Strawberry shampoo was it.This shampoo gets their hair clean and leaves it smelling nice. In addition it works fine as a body wash, which means that I can clean the entirety of their sweaty, mud splattered little bodies with one product. After using it for over a year, I can say that I've found no downside. It doesn't dry out their skin or hair, and it's affordable.Four Stars. Very Good Shampoo. Smells nice and cleans well. We use it as a body wash and it doesn't dry out or irritate my children's sensitive skin.Pam T~",4,Nice Refreshing Scent & Works Well - a review of Suave Strawberry Shampoo,1251849600,"09 2, 2009",0.2145
6,AYF242R6GQMUP,B0000530LV,SunsetDweller,"[4, 5]","This shampoo does not smell like strawberry. It smells like Jolly Rancher or Starburst strawberry flavored candy. Perhaps a bit like Marie Callender's frozen strawberry pie. It is sweet and artificial, but not too strong. Nevertheless, I love it. It takes me back to junior high almost instantly (when I was 12, I purchased any personal care product based on the way it smelled...bonus points for fruity). It lathers well and removes any conditioner product you might have used the prior day/week/year. If you have dry hair and are looking for conditioning shampoo, look elsewhere. This is a shampoo for stripping your hair of excess product. It is not organic, it is not eco-friendly, and it is not really natural. I use it when I need to clarify my hair (and take a nostalgic return to 9th grade).",3,"Smells like candy, a good clarifying shampoo",1292025600,"12 11, 2010",0.1358
