I too have been using this for about twenty five years off and on, but I always come back to this. The scent is great, yet light not at all cloying, the coverage is excellent and very thorough, really tones down the pinky brown color that is my skin after cleansing and applying makeup. The colors do tend to run on the light side, just as a warning if you have darker skin. I would recommend the non color adding Translucent if your skin is darker. I use the light-med. and it is perfect for my light skin. The result is flawless, smooth, lovely and a luminous complexion. The one I trust and will use forever. Note* While I love the looks of the vintage packaging (hasn't changed since 1935), it can be hard to control the stuff from the inside. I recommend poking holes in the plastic, so as to control the product coming out. A few years ago, they put out a sifter with this and why on earth they discontinued it, I haven't a clue. Other than that small technical defect, this stuff continues to rock!!! Best powder out there.",5,"Wondrous, Amazing Loose Powder",1226361600,"11 11, 2008",0.3129

4,A3IL4YCLWGPRWJ,B000052Z5B,Squeakermama squeaker,"[0, 0]","Ok, so I tried this a few years ago and gave it a thumbs down. Well I'm now 50 and in need of some light coverage instead of the more heavy coverage I needed before. A little background on me: I'm half Japanese, olive toned, oily T zone area and slight chin acne off and on. I've been using Everyday minerals but it's making my skin appear rough and too &#34;made up&#34; for my liking. I did try BB cream (Skin79 hot pink) but the color was too light and I am having to mix with another foundation to get a good color. While I looking around I came across this stuff in my old make up bin. Thought I'd try it again. Well it really does a great job of evening my skin out and keeping my natural skin color. This a BIG plus. It is really hard to find a good olive color and I tan quite well in the summer and pale out in the winter. It's really a pain for me to find the right color going back and forth mixing colors. This works no matter how dark or light I am. I also struggle with some large pores on my T zone area. This stuff really helps in that dept a lot. Though my pores are still there, they are no longer noticeable and I no longer have to use a pore primer! The only thing I use is a light under eye concealer underneath and spot treatment on my chin and then brush it on. Another great thing is that this has great staying power.Really keeps the oiliness at bay. I really need that living in Texas! It's cheap but not that easy to find but it's big tub so I would imagine it will last a good long time. The smell if not offensive to me at all. It's nice girly smell, not like sulfur or something like that. So I'm changing my mind. For now this is what works for me ;)",4,Translucent Extra Coverage (2nd review),1402358400,"06 10, 2014",0.1696
5,A340T3DDR0ZTZ6,B000052Z5B,TMarie Corndotz1,"[32, 34]","This is the only cosmetic product I've stuck with for over 25 years. This powder has been around forever and there is a reason for that. It has a very fine texture which applies perfectly. It is also very inexpensive. Most people would be able to use this powder without foundation, since it enhances and perfects the complexion so well. Unless you really need extra coverage, I recommend the basic translucent shade if you wear foundation, which should work with nearly every complexion. The other shades are heavier and, if used with certain foundations, might not last as well for over 8 hours without caking. On the other hand, the heavier extra coverage shades work very well without foundation. I've tried Christian Dior, Lancome, Elizabeth Arden, and a million other loose powders and none of them compare to Coty.",5,Best powder in the world,1166054400,"12 14, 2006",0.2158
