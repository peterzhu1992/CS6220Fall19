I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis, and only have a few small patches on my scalp. Decided to try this stuff, bought it at a local grocery store because I had a $2 off coupon. It seems to help a little, but honestly, I just can't stand the smell. Along with the smell, the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty, not greasy or dry, just weird. When trying to style my hair after using this, I have really bad results. So if you have very short hair and don't need any body in your style, this may not be a problem for you. If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style, go for it. Would never buy this again and I try never to waste stuff, so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo, to help hide the smell. I am doubtful that it will work, but may give it a try.",1,Nasty smelling shampoo!,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",-0.0825

It worked for me but there were no 'instant' improvements. In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly but, 3 months later, it's 99% gone.I'm not sure what the exact problem my scalp had but it was itchy like... you know what. It began about one year ago and I couldn't stop myself from scratching which, of course, ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated. Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November (7-8 months ago) did not help much. He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a fully head of hair and I am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter. (Thank you doc!)To make the story short, a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try. The box claims that this is 'effective from the first use'. It's not. My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much. And... a couple of weeks ago I just noticed - I wasn't scratching or massaging my head any more. The itch was largely gone.I can't say that the T/Gel cured me and it's quite possible that the itchiness would come back if I stopped using it. Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use. Yes, it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.The product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me. It's possible that it doesn't work for everyone but I can't see how trying it would hurt.____________________________________NOTE: about the smell.The active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is 'coal tar' which is smelly. Neutrogena has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn't smell as bad as the traditional ingredient. This version of T/Gel contains 2% NEUTAR.",5,"Three months later, no more itchy-scratchy",1307923200,"06 13, 2011",-0.0137

When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt.One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green. The doctor said, Neutrogena T-Gel. I asked, Is that a prescription? No, he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work, so I gave it a shot.This stuff has been a life-saver. It's not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair. The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a vacation and use another shampoo to liven up my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color. I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year. About 30% of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again. It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.When I used to color my hair, I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.If you have dandruff and haven't tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!",5,works wonders!,1071619200,"12 17, 2003",0.1131
