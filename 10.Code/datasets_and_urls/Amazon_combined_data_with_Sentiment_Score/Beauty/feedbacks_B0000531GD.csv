1,A2YJQPNNAAK5KC,B0000531GD,Amazon Customer Tabbycatz,"[0, 0]",After reading all the reviews on this face powder I was a bit let down. I have been using it for about a week now and it does not to seem to control the shine any better than all the other face powders I have tried. I put my makeup on around 7:30 and around 9 am the shine is already coming through on my T-zone. If I apply it every hour I suppose it would keep the shine down but the whole purpose was something I did not have to keep applying. Also I got Golden and it is a bit light. It is a nice feeling powder and I do like the case and the puff unfortunately it does not control the shine like I hoped.,3,Maybelline NY Shine Free Oil Control Pressed Powder-Golden,1357603200,"01 8, 2013",0.2097
2,A2WQDYM0QCAADO,B0000531GD,Amy Housley Amy,"[0, 0]","This powder really does what it says, controls shine! I have relatively shiny skin, especially in my T-zone, so I have to dab it on there & it takes the shine right out. I don't have to continually re-apply, which I usually find myself doing with other shine free powders I've tried. My typical coloring is nude beige & this soft cameo matched my complexion perfectly. I will say that I am using L'Oreal Paris Magic Nude Liquid Powder Bare Skin Perfecting Makeup & they work perfectly together. I don't have to use much of either.",5,Definite Shine Control,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",0.3275
3,A1L87A1RK0ITWX,B0000531GD,B C,"[9, 9]",I've been using this stuff for years. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ! It sets my foundation great.. & is even great without foundation & still has great coverage! I also use it for touch ups.. A LOT! It lasts quite awhile & doesn't feel heavy or cakey at all. I definitely recommend for someone who is looking for something that is JUST as good as high end powders! The only downside is the powder puff it comes with falls apart VERY easily. I bought my last compact just 3 weeks ago & its completely falling apart! But it's an easy fix because I just use my blush brush to apply it for touch ups. Just wish it came with a better quality puff. It's worth it though for the LOW PRICE! I just recommend tossing the puff & buying a better quality one that can be washed over & over or simply by using a powder/blush brush. Other than that I love this stuff!!,4,I LOVE THIS STUFF!!,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",0.3499

6,A1YLLARX683DKC,B0000531GD,CR,"[0, 0]",I love this powder. I have been using it for a couple of years now. I use it because my face is a little oily. It controls the oil pretty good.,5,Love it,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",0.3409
7,A1EGZRC5SDN3IV,B0000531GD,Dollhouse Domain,"[1, 1]",My only complaint with this face powder is that the powder puff thing that comes with it ALWAYS starts falling apart long before the powder is running out. I've purchased this close to a dozen times and the cheap powder applicator never fails to fall apart on me... Love this powder though - it's great for a matte finish over foundation and not too heavy.,4,Great Face Powder,1341964800,"07 11, 2012",0.2351
8,A38CI1SVH2HOB8,B0000531GD,Jennifer S.,"[0, 0]",I am obsessed with makeup and I absolutely love this powder! It matches my skin tone perfectly and it blends in well with my bb cream and helps me stay oil free all day with little or no reapplication. I would not be able to wear a bb cream or foundation without it because my skin gets oily.,5,helped me look great!,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",0.5019
9,A1X5VVJP78U81E,B0000531GD,Kristina,"[0, 0]","I would say that this powder is average in every single way. Its not the worst quality, but not the best either. Can be a bit chalky if you apply too much, but it doesnt gravitate into fine lines or wrinkles. I would say that there are better powders out there to look for.",3,"Okay powder, not amazing.",1385078400,"11 22, 2013",-0.0776

Which was nice because I'm Jamaican/Mexican with a medium brown complection that looks nothing like the color of the product in the picture.I have incredibly oily skin, this product has not eliminated, but has done wonders for keeping the gross oily spots at bay, for the most part anyway.The only con and the one reason it isn't 5 stars is that i still have shine, but not nearly to the degree that it was before. this has done wonders for my self esteem. I would highly reccomend to anyone who has shine problems :)",4,Works far better than i imagined it would...,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",-0.1273

It is nice to keep in your purse/makeup bag because of it's size. It is in very thin packaging. Sometimes it can be hard to find these. I see these in my local cvs but not in my walmart or walgreens. Not really sure if they are phasing these out.",4,Maybelline shine free oil control pressed powder medium,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",-0.0007
