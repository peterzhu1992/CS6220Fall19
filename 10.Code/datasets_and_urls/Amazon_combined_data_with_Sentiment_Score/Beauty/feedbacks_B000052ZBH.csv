0,A2J19UTYODZC9Y,B000052ZBH,B. Cook,"[8, 8]","I love this mascara! I have used it for several years and when I try other mascaras, I am never happy with them and I always come back to this one. I don't like waterproof mascara because it is so hard to get off and I feel like I pull eyelashes out when I try to get it off. This if perfect; it is truly a thickening mascara and makes your eyelashes look great! And it doesn't have to be black; even the brown looks great! I like that it's also hypoallergenic and that it conditions my lashes with aloe and vitamin B5. And even with the shipping the cost was less than if I bought it in a store...and it's delivered right to my door!",5,Perfect thickening yet washable mascara,1233878400,"02 6, 2009",0.3171
1,ACD0RUGXM2LTY,B000052ZBH,Jess B.,"[2, 2]","I have extremely sensitive eyes. Mascara, eyeliner and even eyeshadow can cause extreme irritation and itching and little white bumps on my waterline. I searched for a mascara I could wear that wouldn't leave me in pain and wanting to take my eye makeup off immediately. This product was recommended to me and I took a chance. I am very happy with the results. Not only did it not irritate my eyes the mascara itself was great! Will be purchasing again.",5,Great for sensitive eyes,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",0.1092
2,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B000052ZBH,jjceo,"[0, 0]",My wife likes this mascara as it thickens and lengthens without clumping. She has a favorite mascara and this one is as good as it is. She also likes that it is washable and easily removed.She doesn't care for the brush as much as others she has tried but she can live with it. One issue that frustrates her though is that the brush is short and it cannot reach the bottom of the tube and she feels that you cannot use all of the mascara that is available.She rates this at 5 stars and would buy it again. I have posted a photo for your information.,5,A good mascara that lengthens and thickens and can be easily removed!,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",0.1752
3,AKNQ36HTHDQ94,B000052ZBH,Kat,"[7, 7]","Just like it. It dries out a little faster than others, but that's ok. I use a cleaned used mascara wand to separate lashes if necessary, when it gets a little older and dries up. It's easy to remove without heavy creams or a lot of scrubbing, and that's what I REALLY like.",4,just prefer it,1274745600,"05 25, 2010",0.2785
4,A1T8KV4XK2LJ,B000052ZBH,Kristen,"[1, 1]","I love this mascara for several reasons. First, it doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes. I use mascara to emphasize my eyes--I don't want red, irritated eyes! It also goes on clump free and makes my lashes look thick and natural. Finally, it doesn't flake off, leaving me with raccoon eyes after a few hours. It's getting harder to find...I hope it doesn't become discontinued!",5,Clump free and no more raccoon eyes,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",0.4211
5,AM4P804SQ95X4,B000052ZBH,Laura B,"[0, 0]",The wand is short and the mascara seems too thick. I guess that's why it's &#34;thickening&#34;. Will go back to Maybelline Great Lash next time.,2,Too thick,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",0.2083
6,A2SP75PNVN1A88,B000052ZBH,Liz,"[1, 1]","I did not really see much of a difference on my lashes. It did make them look a little darker, but it smudged a little bit too. After a while of not using it, it drys up.",3,Mascara,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",0.0
7,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000052ZBH,Melissa Niksic,"[2, 2]","This stuff rivals Maybelline Great Lash as a contender for the best cheap mascara brand on the market. Almay's One Coat Nourishing Mascara goes on smoothly and clump-free. It's easily biddable, and while it's not quite as lengthening as I would like, it's a perfect mascara for work. I've never had any issues with flaking. I recommend it and will repurchase it myself.",5,Wow: great product!,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",0.4105
