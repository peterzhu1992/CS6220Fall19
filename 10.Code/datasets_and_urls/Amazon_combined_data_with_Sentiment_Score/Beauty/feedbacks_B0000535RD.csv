One thing I like about it is it takes much less of this scrub to be as effective as larger quantities some other body washes I've used - one bottle lasts several months for me. It is also much harder to squeeze out of the bottle. Once you get down to the end of the bottle, you have to pry off the cap to get it out - not exactly convenient. The odor is a little bit too sterile for my tastes, but it seems effective as an exfoliator and leaves me feeling clean. While it hasn't really combatted my minor body acne/KP that I can tell, it has kept it under control. I haven't found anything better in effectiveness or bang-for-buck in terms of shower gel or bar soap. I recommend it.",4,"Good enough for me, a few minor issues",1218672000,"08 14, 2008",0.2425

The incidents were never particularly bad, but every once in a while I would get small clusters of about 5-10 small pimples on my back. In the winter my skin would be dry and they would occur on my shoulders, and in summer they would occur on the sides of my back when I sweat a little. I've been using Persa-Gel 10 on them, and while it helped a little it would take a long time for them to clear up completely.So on a whim I decided to try this body wash and I'm glad I did. The Neutrogena Body Clear got rid of all of my back acne within about three weeks time. My back looks great, and I don't see any new pimples forming. The thing that surprised me most about this body wash is that it does not dry out my sensitive skin at all. In fact, when rinsing it off in the shower, I feel like my skin gets softer. The body wash has a very slight fragrance, which to me smells like baby shampoo. The bottle is smaller than regular body wash, but a little bit goes a long way, and lathers up very nicely. I apply it with a plastic mesh sponge poof.All in all... I'm very happy I gave it a try; it was just what I needed for my mild back acne.",5,It works great for me.,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",0.3567

This body wash is great for when you breakout during the summer months- the salicylic acid treats your pimples. It does so quickly and without much irritation to my sensitive skin. However, I thought because it was rather gentle when I did breakout that I could use it on a daily basis- WRONG. After using it for about 5 days in a row, my skin was extremely irritated and very dry.

She'd been using this Neutrogena body scrub for it and, according to her, it worked okay... but not the 'bee's knees' so-to-speak. She was having to shower twice-a-day with it... in the morning before school, and when she got home from school.However, one day we were in CVS to buy another bottle of this Neutrogena Body Clear Scrub, but they were out of it. She HAD to have something, so we substituted CVS's own brand of this body-clear scrub. And, boy-oh-boy, did she find a new treasure! For whatever reason, the CVS-brand cleared her skin all-the-way in no time and she's been using it ever since-- some three years now... and only has to shower once-a-day now as well.If CVS is ever out of their own brand, we have to get something, so have substituted with the Neutrogena again... but it never works for her as well as the CVS-brand. I've learned my lesson, and now stock-up on the CVS-brand, especially when they have it on-sale.(As an aside, she also suffers from facial acne. We were ready to try the ProActive stuff, but a friend of mine suggested we first try the 'Beyond Belief' brand of acne products over at Sally's Beauty Supply. We did and, again, what a treasure! She uses all of the 'Beyond Belief ABH' products: Foaming Cleanser, Clay Mask, Toner, Spot Treatment, Oil-Free Moisturizer, Repair Treatment, Repair Serum, and Exfoliating Scrub.

I don't really have issues with body acne, and never have, but I did have some issues with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms. I figured a body wash of this type would be less likely to aggravate the skin, and might actually lead to an improvement in my skin's appearance (for example, by killing bacteria on the skin's surface). First I tried the regular (orange-colored and unscented) Neutrogena Body Clear wash and it didn't really do all that much for me. The grapefruit wash was a different story. In combination with some Amlactin body lotion, this stuff has made a huge difference in the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.I happen to like the fragrance, although I understand that's going to differ from person to person.

While I don't dispute that someone might have an allergy to one of the ingredients or a sensitivity to salicylic acid, I'd like to set the record straight about a couple of things.First, this is a body wash and should be treated as such. This means washing it off in the shower or bath after applying it (and not leaving it on and letting it dry). It is not a spray or a cream. It does not contain any ingredients that cause bleaching effects (I have a PhD in biochemistry and write patent applications for a living so I am familiar with the ingredients and what they do). It is not difficult to get the last portion out of the container; simply store the container upside down when you are getting near the end.At any rate, I am quite happy with this body wash as it is having the intended effect in my case.
