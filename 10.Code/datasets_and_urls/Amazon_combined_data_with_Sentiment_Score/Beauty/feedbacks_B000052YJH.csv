The other day I was watching a program(Mirror, Mirror) where they featured top models and their beauty regimen. To my excited surprised I see one model using a Buf Puf. I ran to Google and found them being sold on Amazon and some other retail stores. Amazon was the least expensive and I purchased 6.How wonderful to feel that strong clean feeling when using the puff. It is better than any blemish control scrub on the market and leaves no grainy residue.. I could feel those dead skin cells sloughing off and after only one use my skin felt cleaner than after any clay.mask I have removed.

I had previously tried the regular and found that they were a bit too harsh for my skin (I have both eczema and acne, so my face tended to get extremely sensitive even when I was gentle with the puff). The gentle is perfect and I'm happy I bought the 6-pack too.We're currently renovating at home and it feels so nice after dusting, sweeping and mopping every evening to be able to just put a little Cetaphil cleanser on it and just buff off all the dirt....no other scrub product required...I also use the body buf-puf for showering and can't help but feel nice and clean afterwards.A great little product!",5,Perfect for my sensitive skin,1287532800,"10 20, 2010",0.5938

I'm almost 70 and people say I look 20 years younger so keeping the facial skin free of oil and dirt must have some merit. Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon.

It definitely has a scrubby feeling but it's not like a brillo pad or anything, rather, you can tell it's sloughing off dead skin.

15,A291HTT117RVS9,B000052YJH,LisaMaine Lynette in Wisconsin,"[0, 0]",There's a trick to using Buf-Pufs. You don't scrub your skin with them - you use them very quickly and lightly across your skin to create friction. Once they've been used for awhile (on both sides) you need to replace them.

As my skin has aged, I have switched from the regular to the gentle version.I have sensitive skin that doesn't like harsh chemicals. Using these allows me to slough off the older layers as well or better than expensive exfoliants. They helped control acne and now remove the old skin that keeps me from having the healthy glow that the commercials for costly creams promise.

I always attributed my youthful appearance to daily exfoliation with the Buf Puf, but now I think my cystic acne in my 30's and 40's was certainly exacerbated if not caused by the Buf Puf.

In the past I used them every day when I washed my face. Now I use them twice a week. They are especially useful on the days I have used sunscreen to help remove the gunk. They last very well and I usually use one pad for about 6 months or so if I only use them on my face. Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin, they are awesome for that!
