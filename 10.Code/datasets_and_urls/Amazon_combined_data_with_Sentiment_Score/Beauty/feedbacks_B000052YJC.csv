1,A68J3YO34TUOV,B000052YJC,KatKanDoo,"[0, 0]","I've been using a dish sponge, yes, you read that right, a dish sponge to wash my body in the shower. Granted it's a nice spong, the kind that has a mesh lining on it and costs about $3 at my local grocery store...but I thought it was time to commit, to an actual body sponge. I'd read on here, after researching, that the Buf-Puf Double sided body sponge was pretty awesome, so I went ahead and ordered it. I've used it 2x only and I have to say, I get excited (don't look into this too much please) about scrubbing down in the shower now ;-) I also hate mushy soap and use most soaps that come out of a container but a friend gave me a beautiful bar of soap and this scrubber grabs the soap so it's left fairly dry (the soap) and doesn't just sit there (like I'd let it) and build up into a soapy mush. The sponge is definitely a strong scrub on one side, good for elbows, legs and maybe your hard to reach places on your back. The other side is soft enough to use on your face, neck, inner arms etc. Overall, I love this little sponge!",4,Let the sloughing begin!!!,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",0.642

7,A3FS3FJPD3RJTD,B000052YJC,Sunday SundayAtDusk,"[0, 0]","While spring cleaning, I came across my old Buf-Puf handle. I had forgotten all about the Buf-Puf and how good it works. It was wonderful to see it still being sold. Besides doing a super job of keeping your skin clean, it also is great for using if you have been outside in areas with ticks. Years ago, I would visit a wooded area, where there were deer, and pick up tiny, tiny ticks, without knowing they were on me. It was only after scrubbing with this body sponge, that I would see the itty-bitty ticks caught up in the Buf-Puf. Then, I would just rinse them down the drain.The Buf-Puf sponge I received this week is just like the old one--same shape, same size. Thus, it fits my old Buf-Puf back scrub handle. I'm really glad I kept it, since Amazon and every other place online seems to no longer have any Buf-Puf Back Scrub Body Sponge with Reusable Handle. Besides having a white side to scrub your skin, the body sponge also has a tougher blue side to scrub your feet. I had forgotten, too, what a nice job it does on summer feet, when shoes are worn only when absolutely necessary.",5,"Good For Getting Off Tiny Ticks, Too . . . . .",1402790400,"06 15, 2014",0.2361

It also preps your skin well for your favorite lotion.I use the Buf-Puf handle and attach this sponge to wash my back.After many years, I am used to it, but for a first time user, stick to the softer white side and use a gentle touch.Overall a great exfoliate for the the body!",5,great for skin...,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",0.8444
