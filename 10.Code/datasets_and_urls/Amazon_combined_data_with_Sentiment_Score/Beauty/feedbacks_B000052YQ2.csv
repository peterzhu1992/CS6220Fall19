At first I used it on my face and neck, but as I got older, I needed a creamier moisturizer for my face as my skin became drier. I still buy this for my neck though. I've seen women with really wrinkly necks, so far mine is OK.I have ultra sensative skin, this Olay doesn't hurt when I put it on, I like the fact that it has SPF 15 which helps a little bit to protect my skin from the sun. If I'm going to be out in the sun for a long time, I use a different product, with a high number, SPF 30 to 50.When I ordered this, I thought it was the larger size, so when it arrived, I was a bit disappointed. I bought another one exactly the same, in this size at Walmart a few days ago, it only cost $5, I paid $6 here on here Amazon, it's good to shop around.I would recommend this for those who are just beginning to use a moisturizer.",5,GREAT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",0.1923

I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products, and found them all to be rather sticky. I am handicapped and like to sit outside in good weather. I used to freckle up so much, even though many sunscreens say up to 30 minutes. But with this light formula I don't have to use very much, and I don't look like our Dalmatian. This is sort of funny, but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog didn't like the smell and she wouldn't sit real close to me out side. Animals are very sensitive to smells.

So, for the last few years, I began to try many different face cleansers and lotions to solve the problem, and finally stumbled upon this one. It's lightweight and definitely moisturizes just enough. I never feel like my face is oily or greasy. My blemishes haven't completely gone away, but ever since I began using this lotion, my skin has been noticeably clearer. I assume it's because it doesn't clog my pores like my old lotion must have. The only complaint I have is about the bottle. When you squeeze it, you either get no lotion, or the lotion explodes everywhere. I wish they would put a pump on the bottle or something, so that I wouldn't be wasting so much lotion when I barely squeeze it and it all comes flying out.",4,"Great lotion, awful bottle.",1319500800,"10 25, 2011",-0.014

(I bought this product when I was 24 and I am now 26). My skin is horribly acne prone and incredibly sensitive. I have trouble with clogged pores and I really thought since I already have such heavily oily skin that adding more moisture or oil would just send my skin into overload.I couldn't be more wrong. After a month or two of using the product I noticed that my skin had a healthy glow, I noticed that I wasn't as oily. I also noticed that in combination with using my acne treatments that my outbreaks weren't as bad, but were getting better over time. It has helped with the elasticity of my eyes and a little of the product goes a long way. I have had the same bottle for over two years and I just cannot seem to finish the product. It is an amazing little moisturizer. I really like how the SPF 15 is enough for my skin to counter the sun, but become a little darker over time.

29,A2GJX2KCUSR0EI,B000052YQ2,Sneaky Burrito,"[2, 3]","I'm 35 years old (soon to be 36) and I generally stay out of the sun, so I don't have to worry about wrinkles yet! However, I'd like to KEEP my skin looking youthful, and I know that I do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work. Also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces. I figure if I start working on prevention NOW, when I reach that age, I'll be less likely to develop the same problem.Furthermore, I've been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately, and these are drying to my skin. Ideally, I wanted a moisturizer with some sun protection that could also help keep my skin from drying out. This moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore. I have not used any Olay products in the past.This product seems to be doing an excellent job, so far. While I can't predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years, I'm very happy with the day-to-day benefits of using this moisturizer. I put this on in the morning before going to work and wash my face again about 10 hours later. During that time, my face does not look oily at all. Further, I have sensitive skin and I don't notice any redness or irritation. Also, this product does not have a fragrance to it (fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin). So it truly is good for MY sensitive skin.One problem I have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when I dye my hair, the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead (I have a pale complexion and I dye my hair black). I end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days. I've had one hair appointment so far since I started using this moisturizer, and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead this time!I also think my skin is pretty soft since I've been using this, and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that's nice, as well. For what it's worth, it's easy to put on makeup (i.e., foundation) after applying this moisturizer. Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.Wow, I don't normally gush about skincare products this much. I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can't think of anything I don't like about the product. At any rate, I'd definitely recommend this moisturizer.",5,excellent moisturizer,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",0.131
