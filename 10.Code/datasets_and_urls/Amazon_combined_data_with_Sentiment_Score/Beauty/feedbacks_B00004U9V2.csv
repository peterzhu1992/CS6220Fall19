Top if off with my working in the food industry + new York winters and you've got dry, painful hands. I tried many MANY different creams at a drug store one day - 2 hours worth of searching from the least to most expensive creams lead me to this one. It has a light leather smell, so definitely good for men also (I like the smell of leather, so Im a big fan, even as a lady). I put it on after Ive washed my hands and it is thick, rich, and I enjoy massaging it into my knuckles. Once it's on, it doenst leave a sticky or greasy film, just lovely moisture and no dryess. I have a mini tube in my handbag, large pump at the office, an 1in my home. I like the stuff to say the least!",5,Great cream!,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",0.3017

I prefer the rose lotion or some of the other scents. They are just as softening, and I don't have to worry about disintegrating my retinas if I get it in my eyes, accidentally!",3,"I like the moisturizing properties, but the smell is a little overwhelming to me",1402617600,"06 13, 2014",0.1528

Lasts a long time and is the same, rich creme you expect from this line.",5,Same Great Lotion in a Convenient Pump,1397260800,"04 12, 2014",0.2769
4,A1LR48HRU3LSHF,B00004U9V2,Lucille Warren,"[0, 1]","Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener's Hand Therapy has been my favorite lotion for many years. While I don't have a problem with very dry skin, I still like a good, non-greasy lotion for my hands, arms, feet, and sometimes even my face. This product is not greasy. It does not have an annoying fragrance, actually not much at all. My sister-in-law told me she uses it on her psoriasis and it helps. It's not a cure, of course. There really isn't one. But it helps the skin feel better. Since she liked it so much, I tried it and have been using it ever since. It's hard to find in stores---almost impossible---but Amazon.com carries it. Thanks again, Amazon.",5,My favorite lotion of all time,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",0.3523

This cream or lotion seems to work and does not leave that greasy feel or smell to sweet. Good stuff!,5,A favorite,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",0.3947

Nothing beats Crabtree & Evelyn's hand creams for dry hands. This was at a GREAT price too. It arrived as expected in perfect, new condition. If you have dry hands I highly recommend you try one of C&E's hand creams.",5,Great price on great hand cream !!!,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",0.5696
