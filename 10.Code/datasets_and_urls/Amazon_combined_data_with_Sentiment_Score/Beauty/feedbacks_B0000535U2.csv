1,A3JS331R4TEBB8,B0000535U2,doeeyedgrl,"[1, 2]","This lotion makes my skin tone look amazing, almost like a glow. It does appear to even out tone and fade dark marks. However, it takes a while to absorb I guess because when I first put it on, it feels like it's just sitting on my face. A little does not go a very long way with this product. I still love the way it makes my skin look though.",5,brighter complexion,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",0.3434

8,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0000535U2,Rebecca of Amazon The Rebecca Review,"[26, 30]","When buying skin care products lately, I'm selecting items with antiaging ingredients. That would be a variety of antioxidants and healing herbal ingredients. This product has an impressive list.Ingredients: Aqua (Purified Soft Water), Anthemus Nobilis (Chamomile Extract), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Almond Oil), Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower Oil), Glycine Soja (Soybean Oil), Glycerin (Vege), Ester-C Liquid (Vitamin C), Stearyl Alcohol, Aloe Barbadensis Gel, Glyceryl Stearate, Symphytum Officinale (Comfrey Extract), Stearic Acid, Dimethicone, Pinus Palustris (Pine Needle Extract), Persea Gratissima (Avocado Oil), Panthenol (Vitamin B), Allantoin, Potassium Stearate, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Alpha-Bisabolol, Oxybenzone, Tocopherol Linoleate (Vitamin E), Methylparaben, Beta-Carotene, Super Oxide Dismutase Liposome, Propylparaben, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Vitis Vinifera (Grape Seed Oil, Citrus Aurantium (Citrus Oil.).Grape Seed Oil contains powerful antioxidants to limit free radical damage. The oligomeric proanthocyanins (OPCs) in grapeseed extract also strengthen blood vessel walls and reduce swelling. Chamomile Extract is known for its skin healing properties. Aloe helps the skin heal faster by stimulating the body's repair process.I have to admit to seeing results after the first week of using this product. Needless to say I bought another container immediately. The Ester-C in this formula is eight times more effective than water soluble Vitamin C. That explains it! I have never seen my skin change so rapidly.Benefits of this product:Protects the skin by neutralizing free radicalsPromotes cell renewalBoost CollagenMoisturizesReduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinklesEvens out skin tone - if you have sensitive skin, you might be rather impressed withhow smooth and even your complexion becomes.Gives you a radiant complexionJASON products feature only the finest food quality ingredients and they are a much higher quality than the chemical grade used by other cosmetic manufacturers.

I have had great success with Ester C creams - I am not old enough to have any severe wrinkles but it seems to be stopping what little creasing I had starting in its tracks.This cream is heavy and smells good. I mixed some argan oil into it for an extra boost. So far, my face feels very good after using this and I'm glad it comes in a very generous container for the price. I would definitely recommend trying it, especially if you've been using stuff from a drugstore or supermarket - it's definitely nicer.",4,Night cream,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",0.5724
