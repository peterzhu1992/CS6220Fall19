Pumps are hard to close so that they don't accidently pump into my gym bag. I also wanted a cream cleanser because after I turned 40 skin dryness in my face became more of an issue even though I make sure to drink plenty of water. I also purchased it for the price. I didn't even notice that the packaging read oil free. I typically don't buy oil free cleansers because I want more oil in the cleanser to moisturize my skin.Well, don't let oil free fool you. Deep Clean does not dry out my skin. It works as well as cream cleansers that use the word moisturizing on their package.As of 01/06/2012 Amazon listed this product as costing $5.74 for 7 ounces ($0.82 per ounce) and $19.77 for 21 ounces ($0.94 per ounce). It does not make sense to me that the cost per ounce for buying in bulk (the three pack which comes to 21 ounces) is MORE than the cost per ounce for buying a single unit. Buying in bulk usually means saving money. I will be hitting the 1 pack button when I order and then once the item is in my cart I will increase the quantity.

When you rub in this cleanser it creates a cool, tingly sensation -- you can literally feel it working into your pores, and the creamy consistency makes it easy to apply just the right amount. It does a wonderful job of helping to prevent acne and blackheads without drying out your skin.My forehead and cheeks are prone to dermatitis and used to get dry and flaky with the cleanser I'd been using, which was actually also a Neutrogena product: the Deep Clean Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin. It worked for me for a while, but eventually it started to dry me out (which caused more breakouts). I decided to try to cream cleanser based on its superior reviews, and I'm glad I did: something about the composition of the cream cleanser must make it milder than the other product, because I haven't had a problem with dryness or secondary breakouts since I made the switch.As with any face wash I'd suggest using a toner after washing to get rid of any residue, but really, this is one of the best facial cleansers I've ever used (I use it in conjunction withNeutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Gentle Scrub, 4.2 Ounce, and it's the best skin-care combo I've ever tried).

Having had irritation problems with other scrubs, I was cautious to only use this on my forehead prior to using it on the rest of my skin. After using this on my forehead my skin was smoother, but when I moved to my chin a few days later my chin broke out slightly. Although my skin (especially in the chin area) is slightly sensitive-I haven't had friction induced acne in years!This is a white cream with micro-beads in the formula. The package claims these beads are Beta Hydroxy, but after reading the ingredients I cannot figure out what they are. This has a nice fresh scent-citrus but not girly. This has salicylic acid in it-so it does have an acne fighting component.I will continue to use this product and hope my skin can build up tolerance to it, because the areas on my face that did not break out look very nice and are smoother.Skin type: oily, few lines, 20-something, slightly pigmented, semi-sensitive, acne proneIngredients I got off the package: water, sodium methyl cocyl taurate, polyethylene, glycerin, cocomidopropyl, betaine, glycol distearate, stearic acid, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acylate crosspolymer, linoleanidopropyl, PG-dimonium chloride phosphate, neopentyl glycol dicoprlate/dicoporate, salicylcic acid, disodium edta, xanthan gum, magnesium aluminium silicate, sodium hydroxide, cetyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, mathylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, putylparaben, agar, mica, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, red 20 lake, fragrance.",3,Not So Gentle.....,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",0.0839

Last thing those of us with sensitive skin need is left behind makeup. I started using these wipes to remove makeup. I have also used the Biore brand of oil free wipes. These are thicker and softer. The Biore wipes are scratchier. I like these better. However, they are not perfect. They are pretty much useless for eye makeup.My typical routine: Wipe off my makeup at some point in the evening. I then wash my face (could be immediately afterwards, could be just before bed) with my Neutrogena Acne Wash Grapefruit Scrub to exfoliate and get in that salicylic acid. Also, I just don't feel 100% clean without washing my face. I have washed my face before bed every single day for the past 20 years, so it's a hard habit to break! After that, if I have a pimple, I dab on a spot treatment. I also take a cotton ball and remove remaining eye makeup. I always end up removing eyeliner and mascara this way. These pads don't get that off.For me, this is a 3.5 star product. It removes most makeup. I've tested it by using toner afterwards and the cotton balls come out clean.

I understand why some people felt it was too harsh and I would never use it every day, but if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go.

I am a complete fanatic when it comes to my 48-year old skin. I bought these wipes because I needed something to use when I travel overseas, and I don't like carrying soap. This has turned out to be a breakthrough product for me. First of all, I have very sensitive skin, prone to break outs with any oil based products. I use these wipes now instead of Obagi cleansers, as I think they are just as effective, soft and non-irritating, and my skin is perfect now. I get tons of compliments from women and men alike. It is so much easier and involves less mess than soaps. On occasion, if my skin gets dry, I use Aquanil cleanser and these wipes to take off the cleanser, then moisturize with Aquanil. I use this cleansing regimen and alternate retin A, Obagi C Rx serum with hydroquinone, and Obagi C Rx exfoliant and my skin looks like I'm 30 years old tops. Also, my son now uses these wipes--he is a teen and has acne, but these are great and convenient and oil free. He is now more likely to clean his face often with these because of the convenience.
