The gloves dry my hands out & washing them so much during the day really does mess up my skin badly. I've tried other lotions, creams, gels, everything I can think of & nothing has worked. After reading the reviews on this hand cream I thought maybe it would be worth a try & if it didn't work, then there wasn't a real loss because the price is so good.My hands are cracking, bleeding & they hurt so bad. I can't even get rid of one cut before there's another on my fingers or top of my hand.I've started using this cream & immediately it softened the cuts that are already healing & soothed the skin around them. My hands are smoother, softer & the cream absorbed quickly without a greasy after feel.Even after washing my hands it didn't feel like I had to put on more cream right away, my skin wasn't so dry that it was about to crack like it normally does.This really does take just a little bit at a time & leaves my skin smooth. I'm going to try it on my feet too.I have ordered a couple more so I can have one in the car & another at home.

I don't have a huge problem with dry hands, but my cuticles can become so dry that they start to flake and peel, so I try to remember to moisturize my hands for this reason.This product does perform as advertised. It is an extremely thick cream, and you really only need to use a tiny dab. The cream is quite emollient, and I believe that most people will see dryness relief from use of this product. However, several major downsides prevent me from using this product regularly. First, it is VERY greasy. I have found that it does NOT absorb into my skin, so after using it, I can't touch anything with my hands! This is unfortunate, as it generally limits my use of the product to before bed. The second concern is somewhat related--I absolute HATE the screw cap! This may sound insubstantial, but when your hands are greasy, it becomes near-impossible to try to screw the cap back on; most other hand creams that I have tried have a flip-top cap.Because of the above concerns, I will not be re-purchasing this product. Instead, an alternate product that I've tried recently and really like isMary Kay Satin Hands Hand Cream,3 oz. net wt.--this product is moisturizing, absorbs well, AND has a flip-top cap, so I would highly recommend it.",3,"Moisturizing, but too greasy for regular use",1303171200,"04 19, 2011",0.1025

19,A2LXGLSCCV4QD9,B000052YP6,J. Monroe,"[12, 13]","I bought this cream one winter for dry skin and very drying tap water, but didn't use it very much because I live in a pretty warm climate where super cold/dry spells are pretty rare. I nearly tossed it when I was moving but decided to keep it, and I'm so glad I did. I use Epiduo for my acne, which dried out my combo/dry skin even more and made it very red and sensitive. My entire face, and especially around my eyes, was so painfully dry and flaky. Even fragrance-free/sensitive skin creams and lotions still burned and irritated my skin. My skin was flaking so bad during the day from my makeup it was disgusting by the end of the day. I thought I was just going to have to stop using my acne creams altogether, my face was so bad.One night in desperation I pulled this out of the medicine cabinet, and noticed on the back it was non-comodegenic and said you could use it anywhere- lips, eyes, face. I bravely slathered this everywhere, and it was like a miracle for my skin. It didn't burn, there was no fragrance, and it soothed my irritated skin. After a few days of using it morning and night my skin was 200% improved, and my acne has almost entirely cleared up. My acne creams are able to work since my skin isn't constantly dry and irritated, and my skin is seriously glowing from how healthy and moisturized it is now. My makeup goes on perfectly! I use this every night, and sometimes very lightly in the morning if I have a dry spot. It's great on lips and, of course, hands and everywhere else. I carry this with me all the time now.

20,A2EBR70V6P9W0N,B000052YP6,karhill54 karhill54,"[1, 1]","This is MUCH more than a hand cream. It's not really a cream, which initially disappointed me; it's basically a slightly thinner, petrolatum/vaseline-type product. I initially just wanted a fragrance-free creamy hand lotion I could put rub into my hands the same way I would with any other lotion. But this has a slightly different purpose; it's more of a dry skin treatment than a standard lotion-type moisturizer. I found that if I rubbed just a dab on the backs of my hands and on my nails where they can get a rough, ragged and chapped, it softened them up within a matter of a few days. And because it's a little thinner than vaseline, it rubs right in. If it leaves behind any residue, I haven't noticed. I also use it on other dry areas like my elbows and knees without concern that it will come off on my clothes. I have also started using it 2 or 3 times a day on the very rough, dry areas on my feet, including my heels. I spend much of the year barefoot and never wear socks down here in our almost tropical climate. Now, with just a few applications, most of the dry areas are basically cured, and my VERY dry, cracked heels are close to it. I will have to continue using it as a preventive measure, but it does work beautifully.Since the tube size is legally small enough to put in my carry-on on flights and I prefer the fragrance-free version, I can also use it on my face around my eyes and my lips which get dry on long flights. It's basically a multi-purpose product I wouldn't be without and costs no more than a regular jar of vaseline. OTOH, if you ARE looking for something thicker like vaseline, you might find this a little on the thin side. I still recommend trying it, though.",5,A winner for different several uses,1354579200,"12 4, 2012",0.1326

It gets little blisters with fluid inside and that's when it gets very itchy. It's such intense itchiness that I can't stop itching... Then blisters open and crusted on the skin, then it gets cracked open. This year is the worst, it spread on my entire right hand, which really makes it difficult to do anything. I went to doctors for this, probably couple times previously, only thing they give out is prescription strength hydrocortisone that works temporarily but soon enough stop working altogether. I tried homeopathic, herbs, all kinds of stuff but this is the cream that succeeded to moisturize the cracked skin without getting itchy. Other moisturizing creams even the kind for sensitive skin or natural kind, always made my skin even more itchy though it moisturize it okay. But this cream moisturize best, and if used on my kind of skin problem, it'll feel so much better after the skin absorbs it. If your skin feels greasy after using this cream, then this must be too heavy for your dry skin.

I found that it is best used at nighttime. I've tried using it with nighttime gloves, and that works well too. I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't prefer to wear gloves at night, and because it takes time to absorb, you pretty much need the gloves so you don't chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries. I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed, but I put on quite a bit!Because this takes longer to absorb, I wouldn't recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.I use this daily, and because it's so concentrated, that's all I need to maintain smoother skin.

Suggestion: draw a short, thin line of product across the back of one hand and use one finger of the other hand to massage it in from wrist to fingertips; after the gel turns white and then disappears into your skin, repeat on the opposite hand; then rub your hands together to get any remaining gel onto the inside of your hands. Apply sparingly. Don't use it like ordinary hand lotions/creams - it's not like those products; it's a one-of-a-kind product. Applied correctly, it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy. It's fragrance-free, so there's no obnoxious perfume smell.

I rarely needed it until my mid-20s, but when my hands are dry it follows true to its motto, &#34;Just a dab heals dry skin.&#34;The consistency is, at first, something like vaseline. You expect it to be oily and slick. Rub your hands together for about 10 seconds, though, and they feel baby-soft with no residue. It's borderline-magical. It also works for me on elbows and any dry patch of skin. I wish there were versions of this for feet and face, though; it doesn't apply as well to those areas.

50,A3A3F5N7NZCVMT,B000052YP6,tightsandtea,"[3, 3]","Just to clarify, here's what this product is NOT:-this is NOT lightweight-this is NOT instantly-absorbing-this is NOT watery or creamyBasically, don't expect the milky, instantly-absorbing hand creams you'd find at places like L'occitane or C&E.; The formula is more akin to stuff like Aquaphor, so 'hand cream' might be a bit of a misnomer (this is more of a waxy gel than a cream).Be warned--this formula IS waxy, thick, and not as easy to spread as runny, milky hand creams. BUT, it absorbs quickly enough, and application isn't particularly laborious. A little goes a long way.Here's why I like it:-NON-IRRITATING: I tend to get eczema during dry winters, on sensitive areas of my face/arms (e.g. around my lips, elbows, etc). I've tried tons of creams meant for 'sensitive skin', that only served to provoke already-irritated/dry skin. This stuff has never once irritated inflamed skin.-NON-GREASY: ok, so this stuff doesn't instantly disappear onto your skin. BUT, it's not nearly as grossly greasy as products that are mostly petrolatum (e.g. Aquaphor, Vaseline). If I have an eczema flareup on my face, I don't want patches of shiny grease. Thankfully, this stuff is not that.-ACTUALLY HEALS DRY SKIN: I visited to numerous dermatologists who all told me no idea what causes eczema, nothing you can do except use your topical steroid creams. It was a vicious cycle: sensitive-skin formulas like Cetaphil, Cerave, Eucerin, etc, only provoked already-irritated skin, and thus couldn't provide much-needed hydration. Which made my skin dry. But when I used water, it only further dried out my skin. Topical steroid ointments were the only things that worked, until I tried this stuff.
