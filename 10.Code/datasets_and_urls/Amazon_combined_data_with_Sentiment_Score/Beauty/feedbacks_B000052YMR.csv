Also, my skin looked more wrinkled than it was because it was so dehydrated. Cetaphil has seriously taken ten years off my face and body.

22,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B000052YMR,Kate McMurry,"[13, 15]","Dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema. The main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick and it contains no fragrance. I've used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it, even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.I decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients. It's disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients thatCetaphil Lotionlacks. Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see below).Ingredients: Water, petrolatum, glyceryl polymethacrylate, dicaprylyl ether, glycerin, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, PEG-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethiconol, disodium EDTA, propylene glycol.Petrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called rod wax. On the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known. It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin. Premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid (not the same thing as urea) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water. On the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin. In addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately breathe. That is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. As a result, petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.Glyceryl Polymethacrylate: This substance is used in cosmetics to hydrate the skin by increasing its ability to absorb moisture from the air. It is presumed to help heal and reconstruct the dermis layer of the skin and increase skin firmness because it contains elastin.Dicaprylyl ether: This is an oil derived from a plant, AKA dioctyl ether or Cetiol OE. It functions to condition and smooth the skin. It is a non-greasy emollient that spreads easily and is commonly used in non-irritating or sensitive skin-care products.Glycerin: Glycerin AKA glycerol and glycerine is commonly found in medical and cosmetic preparations. It is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant. It is safe enough to be consumed internally.Dimethicone: AKA polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS): This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element. It is approved for internal and external use. Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder. They include itchy, burning skin, hives, dermatitis, swelling of the mouth and breathing problems. Silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients. They make anything they are in more spreadable. They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth. They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum. They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.Glyceryl stearate: This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils). It functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skin irritant for people with sensitive skin.Cetyl alcohol: A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. It is used in cosmetics as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions. In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil: Very safe, natural oil.PEG-30 glyceryl stearate: Emulsifying agent. It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.Tocopheryl acetate: This is a form of vitamin E, a safe preservative. It is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes. In my own case, I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes, but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.Benzyl alcohol: This substance is used as a preservative in IV medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties. It is considered very low risk. It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas. It is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.Phenoxyethanol: When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. Unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. It can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.Sodium hydroxide: Like potassium hydroxide, this is another name for lye. It is used in the paper and chemical industries, for the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, for pH regulation, and in the production of aluminum. It is used to neutralize acids and increase the alkalinity of whatever it is in. I would presume that is the reason for its use in this product but--lye? Really?Acrylates/C10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer: This is a lab-derived, white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market. It is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets. Though considered safe enough to consume internally, like Vitamin E, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis). So far, I've never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so, presumably, I'm not allergic to this ingredient.Dimethiconol: Similar to dimethicone (see above).Disodium EDTA: This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages. When combined with vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it forms benzene, a dangerous carcinogen. This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.Propylene glycol: This lab-derived compound is a form of mineral oil commonly used in brake and hydraulic fluid and in antifreeze. Cosmetic products employ it as a humescent, to prevent the escape of moisture from the skin. Unfortunately, the Material Safety Data Sheet of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin. In addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.",4,Widely recommended for soothing irritated skin,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",0.0914

Since my skin is so dry, especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more, I have tried both. I think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked, dry, red skin, the thing about Cetaphil (specifically the cream in the jar -- not the pump lotion) is that it is not even a tad bit greasy compared to the former. It eliminates dry skin within a few hours. My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter. Both of her children also have hands that look so chapped you would think that they were sunburned. I bought this to give her a sample of as well. She keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works. Besides its effectiveness, the odorless, nongreasy, tasteless, very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that I have ever come across. I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter, I use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe & vera.

It's economical, it doesn't contribute to breakouts (the skin on my face has an attitude), it moisturizes and keeps my skin that way throughout the day, and it seriously softens everything it touches.

Even after I apply this to my face or neck, where my skin is dry and flaky, it's as though it dismally staved off and forestall the inevitable shedding of the skin. I apply this liberally both in the morning and at night, like it suggests, but haven't had impressive results. I gave this product two stars, because it is decent against mild-dryness, but that's the limit of Cetaphil's capability. Also, I will admit, one jar lasts me a very long time. Even after applying a liberal amount, twice a day, it's taken me months to topically consume the entire jar. It's probably the most long-lasting/durable product I've possessed.
