0,AFNE6AFYU3ZVD,B0000530EZ,A. Fink,"[5, 7]","I have used conditioning sprays by dove, loreal (costs $9 a bottle!) and frizz ease. This stuff is by far the best and only $3 a bottle at the store. I haven't gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont' have any split ends. I use it on my son too because he gets crib head or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it, even though he is 2. This is the best priced and best working spray. I use sulfate free shampoo, skip the conditioner and just use this. I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference, it is a tiny bit coarse, it isn't thick or thin. This stuff doesn't weigh my hair down either or make it oily, I still only wash my hair every other day.",5,The best,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",0.2323

I use a little every night after I shower and occasionally in the morning, and it really helps to keep my curly hair from tangling and the ends from splitting/frizzing. It also has a pleasant, light scent, and it's a good deal price-wise compared to other leave-in conditioners (many of which I've tried and not been nearly as impressed with).The only drawback is that I have very thick hair and thus go through a bottle of this in a month -- I wish it went a little further.

Because it's a spray mist, it's much easier to control where and how much I want to apply, which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down, even after ample rinsing. This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I don't know why since it's not meant to do that, but I don't mind. The scent is wonderful and light.

I use a small plastic bottle (the .97 bottles that walmart sells in the 'travel size' bins work for me.) to mix 1/3 water to 2/3 conditioner. This gives a good mix for morning for waking up dead head curls. The bottle I use gives more spray per squirt so I'm able to really wet my hair, as needed, and don't get hand cramps from using the conditioner's pump spray.I use the condition 'straight' for rainy or damp days to battle frizz. Even if I get caught in the rain, the conditioner will help hair dry without frizzing. The conditioner's bottle pump is a little stiff and if you've got a lot of hair, you may want to get another plastic bottle to use it straight, to avoid hand cramps. I don't; but, for arthritis sufferers, it may be necessary.I also use it 'straight' as hair spray for 'setting' a style.
