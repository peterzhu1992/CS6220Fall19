I tried the Konsyl for Balance with Psyllium fiber and prebiotic with insulin fiber which is for everyday digestive health. This helps control constipation, diarrhea, colitis and IBS. Since this is already an orange flavor I figured mixing it with orange juice would be a good way to go about trying it. This definitely was a good idea considering I could hardly tell I had added anything at all. As I already said, I can't really comment on the health benefits too much since I hadn't had any recently problems *knock on wood* with my digestive health lately, but I can tell you that it's easy on the digestive system. I didn't get sick or have cramps after using the product, which I'm pretty sure is a good thing. Best part of this product though, if you're pregnant it is safe to use and if you're diabetic it's safe to use as it is sugar free and gluten free! So if you fit in either of those categories this is definitely a product that may be beneficial to you.READ FULL REVIEW: [...]",4,Good Product Brand,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",0.5783

Sometimes it works too well /cough-cough/, so be careful with the dose.Seems pricey, but you get a good bang for your $.",5,No hidden sugar - big deal if you have diabetes,1342828800,"07 21, 2012",0.6586

I have tried many different types of fiber supplements and I keep coming back to Konsyl Natural Fiber. I usually do ALL my shopping at Amazon.com because I am a prime member and the products work out to be cheaper than me going 20 miles one-way to the nearest store and then paying sales tax. However, this is the first product that is overpriced on Amazon. Walmat has this product for $13. So I will buy there instead of here. My review should be that if you suffer from constipation, then this is a great working fiber that is almost taste free.",5,Best Fiber Available Today,1348444800,"09 24, 2012",0.0757
3,A100UD67AHFODS,B000052Y5F,Expressed Reviews Expressed Reviews,"[4, 5]","When I went to see my gastroenterologist last September; he recommended that I start using this product twice a day. He was making the recommendation, based on a family history of colon cancer, plus the fact that I had hemorrhoids and a weak anal sphincter muscle. While he said that Konsyl would not improve the hemorrhoids or anal sphincter muscle; the introduction of fiber to my diet would prevent them from getting worse. Little did I know that there were so many other benefits to using this product, including weight loss and lowering cholesterol. I'm finding that regular use of Konsyl completely eliminates the constipation I was experiencing, and it's great to know that it has so many other attributes. I mix it with an 8 ounce glass of water, although it's probably best to use a shaker. Mixing it in water with a spoon doesn't fully distribute all of the fiber, but it works well enough for me. I don't notice any taste to the Konsyl and have no problem drinking it down,. As mentioned on the label; I drink an additional glass of water right after drinking the Konsyl, to make sure it's all washed down. One additional note; my gastroenterologist said that he recommends Konsyl over every other brand of fiber. When I went to the Konsyl website; they display a graph which shows that it contains more usable fiber than any other brand. This product is highly recommended by me.",5,Konsyl is a great product ~ Buy it for less at Wal-Mart,1353110400,"11 17, 2012",0.1168
4,A3BW20IBFO2EFX,B000052Y5F,M.M. Billings,"[5, 6]","Years ago I used this but I used one rounded tsp 3 times a day along with a healthy diet. I gradually lost 56 pounds and lowered my blood sugar levels, and my cholesterol levels dramatically.Since that time I went off of it, returned to my bad ways of eating, regained the weight, and blood sugar and cholesterol went way up again.For the past several months I have once again been taking fiber supplements. I had been taking Konjac Glucommanan Powder and have been very pleased with it. But, I decided to try Konsyl again since I can just go to the store and buy it instead of ordering online.I do not like taking the Konsyl as well as I like the Konjac Glucomannan. And, there is some differences in the two fibers. Konjac Glucomannan is solely a soluable fiber (which will more effectively lower your cholesterol), while Konsyl is a mixture of both soluable fiber and non-soluable fiber (the non-soluable fiber helps 'sweet' your colon and creates faster transit, while the soluable fiber lowers the cholesterol but doesn't increase the speed of transit).So, if your transit time is too fast you may want to look more at taking Konjac Glucomannan. But, if your transit time is too slow Konsyl would be better. If you want (more) lowering of cholesterol than Konjac Glucomannan would be the way to go. If you want faster transit along with cholesterol lowering than Konsyl is the way to go.I have decided to alternate using both products; one product at one meal, the other product at the other meal. So, alternating both products should give me the best of both.Konjac Glucomannan sticks to the side of the glass if you don't mix and drink fast enough, but it goes down smoothe. But, there also is a slightly odd flavor to Konjac Glucomannan. Konsyl is a pretty much flavorless fiber, but has gritty path down that I really don't care for. But, it's not terrible.",4,Comparing Konsyl to Konjac Glucomannan,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",0.1108

It definitely does, however, what it claims to do. You pretty much cannot take it without knowing it'll work later in the day.",3,"Tastes terrible, but it works",1381017600,"10 6, 2013",-0.0768

I don't like to spoil something like o.j. by putting it in that, even tho it is tasteless. Drinking it with water is just beyond my ability to do consistently...maybe I'll keep trying, as this is a big container, and I do need the fiber.",3,Just can't hack it,1326499200,"01 14, 2012",0.1641
