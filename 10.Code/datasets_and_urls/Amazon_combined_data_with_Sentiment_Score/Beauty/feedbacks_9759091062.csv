Also it tends to dry out my skin and made my face feel weird the next day. I stuck with it hoping it would LIGHTEN,.....but it didn't.",2,"no Lightening, no Brightening,......NOTHING",1405209600,"07 13, 2014",,0.0168

2,APBQH4BS48CQO,9759091062,"[0, 0]","I have mixed feelings about this product. When I first started using it, I can see and feel the difference. It actually started to literally peel the dark skin away. There's a bit of a sting but that's how I know it was working. My skin was lighter in just a couple weeks! However, once I've stopped using it when I reached my desired skin color, it went back to being dark. I applied more and suddenly it was no longer working. It didn't peel or sting. I wonder what went wrong or if it has an expiration date or something. Overall, it works but definitely not consistent.",3,Mixed feelings.,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",Charmmy,-0.007

As I applied the gel in a circular motion i was doing so, I started to see dirt like skin come off. It was incredible :) as of today my arm pits are still white, well as they should look.",5,This works,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",Jessica Anarchykisses,0.2283

9,AXPKZA7UZXKTT,9759091062,"[2, 4]",Good product. Use a little bit on your spot and the next day its already shedding the first layer of skin. By the 3 rd day the spot is almost gone. Cant get these results from the most expensive products,4,excellent,1382054400,"10 18, 2013",Shirleyyy,0.1101
10,A2SIAYDK7GG7QA,9759091062,"[0, 1]",I didn't use it past a week. The reason why is that it's smelled kind of funny. will look for another product that doesn't smell so perfumy.,3,weird smell,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",theredtranny,0.1277
