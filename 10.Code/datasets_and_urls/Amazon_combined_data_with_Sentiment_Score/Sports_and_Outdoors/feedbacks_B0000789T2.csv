It is fragile in the wind and will be carried away by it. Not the best on the beach. Takes some practice getting the right throw. Tends to get a little wild. Also beware of trees.

It's amazing to watch as the wind will lift and lower it as it sails through the air. It's can be a great dog retriever toy if your dog doesn't chew his fetch toy. Since it sails so far, it will tire the dog quickly, however if he chews on it much, it won't sale much at all.",5,Aerobies are Awesome,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",0.2013

It aerodynamic profile allows this ring to maintain lift for quite a long distance.Start with short distances.

I still remember seeing it travel over the top of some phone lines at the end of a football field (I started on the opposite side) and watching it just keep going. I'm 39 now and my girlfriend and I bought one today and took it to the park since we finally had some sun. What fun! It goes very far with little effort. The ring shape makes it easy to catch. If it's not flying level you just give it a gentle bend up or down to correct. I never liked Frisbee's since the solid disc was hard to catch for me. This is well worth your time and money. I'd only stress as all reviews do, this will travel great distances with little effort. It might be a good idea to bring two in case it one gets away from you. Oh and I don't think it would be good for dogs to catch. Their teeth would likely crack the spine on the first catch.",5,Lots of fun,1301788800,"04 3, 2011",0.1927

Unfortunately, the smaller sized one is also our dog's favorite-in-the-whole-world frisbee, even though she has many different frisbees, especially dog specific ones. But none even come close to the Aerobie in her opinion. She LOVES it and goes bonkers every time it comes out in the yard. She will chase it forever, until she literally drops. We have to have a little pool for her to jump in often, because she gets so overheated. It is definitely not made to hold up to dog teeth, and so we cannot her alone with it for even a minute. We play frisbee with her until WE are tired of throwing, and then we immediately put it away where she cannot get it. Even so, we still have to replace hers every couple of months.

17,A13G1TKIKHGV3F,B0000789T2,M. Heiss,"[0, 0]","This thing GOES.We get our best results from a determined onslaught to bend the ring DOWN on both sides, like a taco. Hold it in place for a minute, and then the ring gets great lift and is easier to aim. The bent position lasts for hundreds of throws and catches and grass landings -- we just bend it that way once and then play with it for the day.This is great to keep in the car. For my littlest son, we stand close together and just play catch back and forth -- he likes to catch it by popping his fist through the ring as it gets close. For bigger kids, they have plenty of time to run into position for cathcing the disk -- this thing floats for a long time.Watch out for trees.

21,A244ODGWRUZCD2,B0000789T2,R. Blum,"[11, 14]","To classify this as a frisbee does it a disservice and is misleading. This is a whole new device that uses similar throwing techniques but the experience is completely different.I was never much of a frisbee thrower, they would always catch a wind and veer in different directions, the lip was weird to let go of at the right time, I could go on and on. I know some folks are great at frisbee, but not me.There are those feel that if a sport or activity is not difficult then it's not rewarding. Stay away from this if that's your motto, this is easy.This device has single-handedly made every frisbee ever made obsolete recycle material. Instead of working against you, it works in your favor.The first time I threw it the Pro 13 flew across 2 adjacent baseball fields behind my house and would've continued were it not for a fence.You have to learn to take it easy and forget everything you've learned throwing a frisbee. Don't throw it too hard or you might not get it back.I'm ordering 2 more right now because my 20 yr old son was by today so he has to have one and I need a backup.

Throwing it correctly is not hard.It also flies FAR. So, make sure you have ample room, such as a field. We tried playing with one near our house on a 1 acre lot and it got stuck on the roof quickly.Later, I took my 10-14 year old kids to a football field to throw it, and we were regularly getting 50 yards on modestly powered throws.

But I'm happy to report that those were unfounded fears. This thing is very easy to use, flies much farther than a frisbee ever has for me, offers a great deal more control, doesn't lose course as much due to wind resistance, is durable, and seems much safer than a frisbee. I say safer, because the covering of the ring itself is a very soft rubber. If you accidentally hit someone with a frisbee, there is danger of bruising, etc. But I don't see that happening here. Catching is never painful; even when your throwing partner exerts a little too much force. If there is bad to be found here, I simply have not spotted it.
