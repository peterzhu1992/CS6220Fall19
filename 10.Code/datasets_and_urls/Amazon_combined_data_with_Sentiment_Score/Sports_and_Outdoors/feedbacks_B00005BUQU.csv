1,A2U27A197AH87W,B00005BUQU,Cliff Lohner,"[0, 0]",This thing really is awesome. Flys great. I used someone's for the first time a few weeks ago at the river playing a game. It was such a good Frisbee I had to buy one to put in the boat...,5,Awesome frisbee,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",0.4812
2,A1R6FXSZVCIJKK,B00005BUQU,fishstick,"[0, 0]",I've bought several different brands of frisbee and this one flys the best. my dogs love that it will hang in the air and is easy to catch. if you want one that your dogs will love to catch then this is the real deal.,5,this is the real deal,1363478400,"03 17, 2013",0.7013
3,A2WNHEH56ONTV,B00005BUQU,Jivix,"[0, 0]","This little guy is one of the best frisbee designs ever. The Superdisc is easily the best frisbee to play catch with your friends, the rubber ring around makes it easy to throw and catch (Well, you have to get used to the extra grip when throwing it, people tend to hold on to it too long and it angles in the direction their arm moves).It holds itself pretty stable in the air as well, you can do long, straight throws with it.And as a bonus, the rubber prevents people from getting seriously hurt when hit (it still hurts though!)",5,This is the best frisbee you can buy.,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",0.8013
4,AOV8L3S4QEMJF,B00005BUQU,KewlDadiJ,"[0, 0]","Got a couple of these for our eighth graders to use during our brief daily recess. Prior to the arrival of the Aerobies the frisbee crowd was six to eight nerds. Now we have almost all the &#34;cool kids&#34; throwing the Aerobies. These things really fly... We have the smaller ones, too. The deal there is to throw them up for altitude.These are great.",5,Beyond cool,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",0.125

6,AHTD9HQP6YJ2G,B00005BUQU,Maria B,"[0, 0]","I love these things. We use them for ultimate Frisbee. Very forgiving when thrown by beginners and they don't hurt as much as getting hit with a real Frisbee. They aren't indestructible though so try not to bend them or step on them, or they won't fly as well. Also some die hard frisbee players don't like them as much because they fly differently than a normal frisbee.",5,I love these things,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",0.0585
7,A1W9Z0FT00LC06,B00005BUQU,Maya,"[1, 1]",this a good disc nothing extraordinary. i think there are better discs out there in the market.. good for an evening in the park to play though. cant complain considering the price.,3,its a good disc nothing extraordinary,1373587200,"07 12, 2013",0.506
8,A3TXQIOHXRCDFC,B00005BUQU,Riyad Kalla,"[0, 0]","This really is the ultimate frisbee... it has the power/flight capability similar to an Aerobie, but is dead easy to throw. You can even try and throw it wrong and it levels itself out in flight and goes nice and straight.The rubberized grip/edges make it really comfortable to catch/throw and is about 100x better than solid plastic frisbees and a HECK of a lot easier to play around with than a real Aerobie with folks that don't want to have to learn a lot of technique.If you like parks, stop reading this review and just buy one and keep it in your car. It is awesome.",5,"This will change your life (not really, it's just a frisbee)",1359676800,"02 1, 2013",0.3499
9,AYYH3V2FXN9LF,B00005BUQU,tech junkie,"[0, 0]","I have used lots of traditional and not-so traditional frisbees and this is the best yet.It is just the right weight and size, flexes nicely during catches and flies very, very far.It also slices through strong winds really well and doesnt seem to Float as much as other disks; so goes where you want it.My children, 5 and 7, have finally learned how to throw and catch because this is easier to throw and catching it doesnt hurt their hands.I recommend this product.",5,Great frisbee,1349136000,"10 2, 2012",0.9646
