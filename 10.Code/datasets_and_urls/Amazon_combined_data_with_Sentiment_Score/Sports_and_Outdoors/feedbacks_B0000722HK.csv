They help compress my muscles and help align everything. By the end of the day, I'm sore but the next day I feel great. Will definitely buy more.",5,Great,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",0.2739
1,A3SDKH1RN7DQYI,B0000722HK,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","The Tee worked relatively well, managing perspiration and keeping body cool and &#34;together&#34;. Though it seemed easier to run / breath during running, the rest of the activities were neither hindered nor enhanced by the shirt (shirt was used in a Spartan race).Overall, I was pleased with the product, though expected the compression to be a bit more than what was achieved by the Tee.",4,Under Armour 1201166 Heat Gear Compression Full Tee - Black,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",0.6087
2,A2Q2QZH42ZEIFF,B0000722HK,Coby Moore,"[0, 0]",like the other reviews state order size bigger...trust me I usually wear XL...I'm 6ft 210 broad shoulders so I read the reviews and followed their advice. I ordered an 2XL and this shirt is very tight without being washed yet. SO do order size up.,4,Nice compression shirt...runs small...,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",0.1204
3,A2YN8C352740ZX,B0000722HK,Douglas R. Fleck,"[8, 8]","I have been wearing compression shirts for years. Under Armour is by far the best quality. It is called compression wear for a reason. It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body. I am 5' 8, 155 lbs. and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to. If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear. Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature. They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture. However, I think one of the best features is that since they don't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides. Compression wear was not created to look sexy. It is serious workout gear. If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help. Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts aren't girdles. They make these things in loose fit also. Not quite the same benefits, but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt. If you can wear the compression shirts get them, but expect them to be skin tight. You won't regret it.",5,Better Be In Shape,1326326400,"01 12, 2012",0.264

THEN when I got it I was SO glad I promptly ordered two more. Fits fine, feels fantastic, very comfortable. Suppose it doesn't look too bad, either.",5,Great Shirt,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",0.6107
5,A89V2EIM5FMP5,B0000722HK,Harpers,"[0, 0]",both love these shirts.. I get the grey ones for son and white for hubby. They keep the moisture off them when they work and play and a perfect everyday undershirt.,5,hubby and son,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",0.4718
6,AMVC9WTXYKNJ1,B0000722HK,J. Edgar Mihelic Skyscraper,"[0, 0]","I fell in love with Under Armour's products four years ago, and that hasn't changed.They were still a niche brand then, on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ...Gear products are the reason why. They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved Tactical version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton. The hold you in place. You are not as hot as some may be while working hard. You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money, and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can.",5,You are armoured,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",0.2703

8,A2AZCTAXMIO7CY,B0000722HK,Scott,"[0, 0]",I like to use this as an under shirt and it works great I normally use a XL shirt and ordered a L to follows the other reviews on here. Good thing I did they fit great. The only thing I don't like about them is that when I put on the white shirt I can see through the shirt.,4,Smooth shirt,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",0.4893
9,AFNYEP9UND180,B0000722HK,Steve,"[0, 0]","there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I'm not gonna lie... I've tried a few of them to save a little money. but i ended up being very disappointed every time. then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it. it is such a great line of products, and very versatile. i use it for hunting, i use it for running, i use it at work. it's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour, it's going to be a solid product. keep up the great work.",5,it's under armour... need i say more.,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",0.1781
