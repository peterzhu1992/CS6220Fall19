For a few dollars more, the Leatherman Micra has a much superior scissors, a better nail file, more screwdriver options, an easier-to-handle knife, and a bottle opener. The Leatherman Squirt is even better, and not that much more.",2,Get a Leatherman Micra instead,1129507200,"10 17, 2005",0.6301

Powell,"[63, 85]","There are a number of great credit card knives, (so called because they are when folded the size of a credit card) made by both S.O.G. which makes the Access card, and Spyderco which makes the Spydercard. The cost nearly is the same and the others have actual useful blades. This thing is cheap, cheap, cheap incomparison.

The x-ray operators either didn't spot it in my bag or weren't too concerned about it (on either leg of my last round trip flight).The knife is too small for anything too useful other than maybe a letter opener or to poke through the seal on your bottle of Advil.The pen is interesting, but a little hard to manage if you have big hands.It probably would be most useful in your toiletries kit for when you're travelling.",3,It is what it is...,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",0.6839

8,A1FUBPW8U2RYUY,B00004YVAM,Subir Singh Gadget Geek,"[0, 0]","I have carried the Swiss Card in my wallet for nearly 13 years and the tools work just as well as day one. The no-nonsense tools are practically designed and seem to help me out daily. I use/find use for atleast one of these tools daily - the blade, scissor, pen and straight pin. The remaining nail file, screwdriver, tooth-pick, ruler and tweezer do get use but a little less frequently.The design is probably most convenient of all. About 3x the thickness of a credit card, you can put it in your wallet and forget about it. And TSA does too...I have never been stopped!I bought this second card as a replacement to my first one as the case of the first one was disintegrating with years of use and being bent over in my back pocket. It was still functional but was looking tardy. This newly designed case does not have any moving parts and seems to be a little more robust that previous cases. Looks like they re-designed to ensure that the case does not crack while in the back pocket wallet.The great thing about Victorinox products is that they are high-quality and built to last. The sharpness on the blade persists even after years of use - lasting sharpness on a blade edge is a Victorinox trade secret.One of the few products that has a 5-star rating from me and it rightly deserves it. If you can buy sub 20 dollars, it is a steal, but even worth it at 25 bucks.",5,You can leave your AMEX home but do not leave home without this!,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",0.2158
