Perhaps the thin layer of gel may be enough for people already accustomed to riding, but for those just getting into or (like in my case) back into the sport, I'd suggest padded shorts instead. Those definitely eased the pain a lot more than the seat cover.",2,My Tail Bone Says Ouch,1311292800,"07 22, 2011",0.0433
1,A308CSLMLOO5B0,B00005OKZ7,dredman1,"[1, 1]","Item does what it advertises - cushions your rear from hard seats. However, I've had mines about a month now, and it's already beginning to get compacted or flat. It's no longer as soft as it originally was, and it now starts to get uncomfortable after about an hour or so. But it's still not as bad as the seat without it.I use it on average twice a week for about 1.5 hours at a time.Also, unlike some of the other reviews here, thankfully it has not (as yet??) split and the gel start to leak out. It also is a bit wider at the back than most bike seats, so it sometimes slides about and goes off center slightly, even if you tighten the drawstrings as much as you could.Bottom line - it'll give your rear end some comfort, but if I could do it again I'll probably try for a comfy seat instead first.",3,3.5 stars if I could give half ratings,1271894400,"04 22, 2010",-0.0009

The gel pad has taken away all pain and made riding quite enjoyable.However, after about 200 - 300 miles, the seam came apart and shows some of the gel. Not really a complaint, but it would be great if this lasted longer. I still consider this a good deal for $[...]",4,"This really has saved my, well, you know",1251936000,"09 3, 2009",0.322
3,A1MUEG0HE45PA3,B00005OKZ7,Jane Doe,"[0, 0]","This is a seat pad meant to cover your existing bike seat to provide more comfort. I mistakenly ordered this thinking it was the Bell Gel Base Bicycle Relief Seat Cover which has an indenture in the center and the edges are raised. Doesn't matter as this one was half the price of the one I intended to buy and probably more comfortable after reading the reviews about the Relief seat cover. Both look the same on a computer screen so be careful and make sure you're buying the right seat cushion. Anyway, this adds a slight cushion if you already have a semi cushion in your standard bike seat, but could probably work wonders on a typical hard standard bike seat . The seat that originally came on my road bike is pretty big and this cover fits on tight (almost too small but it fits). This cover would probably work best on a narrow seat. And yes, like the other reviews have mentioned it does tend to slid a little and get off center. This could probably be fixed with a good sticky double sided tape. It doesn't bother me much and though it doesn't feel like sitting on a cloud, it adds a little bit of extra comfort.",3,Gell isn't soft but it serves its purpose of adding some comfort,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",0.4083
4,A1F7SX3GNVBNE3,B00005OKZ7,Joshua G. Feldman Technophile,"[26, 26]",This is my second gel seat cover. I'm already a huge believer in gel seat covers because I used to find riding my bike very uncomfortable and using a gel seat cover allowed me to bike a lot more with a lot less discomfort for a small investment. The gel padding takes the edge off the pressure on the pelvic bone and allows me (a heavy guy - 300+ lbs) to bike for hours. My last seat (not Bell) lasted 3 years - until the gel started to lose its integrity (and form loose chunks under the cover. I was a little nervous about the Bell Gel Base because it's so inexpensive. I was afraid it would smaller or thinner or somehow compromised - but no problems. The Bell Gel Base is just as good as any gel seat cover I've seen and fit both my large seat and my wife's small seat just fine (via the adjustable pull cord). The Gel is firm but deep and works great.The concept with a seat cover is you just put it over your existing seat. The possible downsides are that it might slip a bit to one side during use. I periodically have to straighten mine out - but no big deal. The upside (over buying a special gel seat) is that it's less expensive and when it wears out you just buy another.,5,Excellent value in a gel seat cover.,1225670400,"11 3, 2008",-0.0148

But after I installed this, I rode 4x around the neighborhood without feeling a thing. It doesn't seem like it would do much when you put it on, but I have to say it has made my ride feel like air. It feels like I am just riding on my peddles and frame. I can't recommend the gel seat enough. This one fit my bike very well and for a great price.

6,A2CM63X1NLPFHW,B00005OKZ7,KenCT,"[0, 0]","I had a little trouble getting this saddle cover to fit tightly, it took some effort to get the ties real taught and to cross tie them under the seat. It worked pretty well for a while, but then over time it felt like the gel was breaking up and then I left the bike in the sun and the gel started to melt an ooze out of the material. That was it, it was ruined. It lasted one season of riding. Felt good when it worked. It did the job of getting me acclimated to my bike seat. After a good season of riding i didn't need it any more, the standard saddle is fine.",2,good until it melts,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",0.1813

It works well, and far better than another competitor's seat which failed to protect my tailbone. The problem is, after only 3 rides (about 50 miles total) it has already begun to wear out. The stickers and wording are already almost gone...[...]...and the edges of the seat are already wearing out. For only $15, I was not expecting miracles.

I can't think of a good way to 'lock' it on so I'm just going with a comfortable seat that can't be taken off so easily. Be warned.",3,warning: easily stolen,1268179200,"03 10, 2010",0.2231
9,A2HTOG7TTBU5Z2,B00005OKZ7,S. Johnson,"[0, 0]","I really do like this seat cover. That is, I like sitting on it. Everything else about it is kind of a hassle.PROS (Or the pro, really, because there's only one): It's comfortable. I wouldn't say it's like riding on air, but it does make my bike saddle about 50% more comfortable and my sit bones about 50% happier.CONS:1. As other reviewers have noted, it tends to slip to the side, no matter how tight you pull the drawstring. I eventually solved the problem by attaching it to my saddle with double-sided duct tape, but that solution only works if you want to leave your seat cover on all the time.2. The seam frays and the fabric runs easily. Mine started to pull apart along the seam after only a couple of uses. I held it together for a while by painting the seam and the runs with clear fingernail polish, but after a few months the seam gave way anyway and I had to resort to duct tape.3. When it gets wet, it takes hours to dry, and in the meantime, riding around on a wet seat is distinctly unpleasant. Since my bike stays outside nearly all the time, I've started carrying a plastic grocery bag in my backpack and tying it over the seat whenever it looks the slightest bit like rain, but I've had a few wet rides all the same.So, bottom line (no pun intended): if you're looking for an easy, relatively cheap way to make your bike more comfortable, this seat pad will work, but you have to be prepared to put up with its flaws. If you don't want the extra hassle, you'll probably be happier if you spend a little more and get a whole new bike saddle.",3,"Added comfort, added hassle",1372118400,"06 25, 2013",0.318

Unfortunately, I scanned the reviews too quickly. What I thought I read was that it was a bit too tight so I was thinking this would be perfect for a road bike. But in reality it apparently is perfect for a STATIONARY bike. One of those with the huge seat on it.

The fact is I have a Selle SRL Titanium saddle in red color and I wanted something to use as a cover to preserve this expensive saddle during I transport my bikes or when I have to ride in very muddy conditions. So I bought this product purely as a cover and I didn't make much research on this item, supposing that any will fitFirst of all, I was very unpleasantly surprised by the weight of this product. It is unreasonably heavy, very heavy. It is made very big just to be more universal and fit more saddles, but its not the best idea. If you apply it on narrow saddle, than you cant fix this cover at all. It moves and slips all the time. Fixing strand is another bad idea. In fact, I can't find any positive point in this product thus I can't recommend it. Don't waste your money!",2,Dont buy it,1267315200,"02 28, 2010",-0.1049
