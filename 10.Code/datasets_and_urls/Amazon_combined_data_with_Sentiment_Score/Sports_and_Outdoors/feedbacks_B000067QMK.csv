0,A3D8STMS7SUR4I,B000067QMK,Adult Star,"[0, 0]",I gave this a 4 star because the hard caps are larger than average pads out there but I took off a star because there's absolutely no padding beyond the hard caps when other pads out there have thick padding that extend beyond the hard caps. These pads are too small to fit over clothing. There good for shorts and t-shirts. Also good for wearing underneath clothing.

It does not have the sock like material that covers the whole knee or elbow but the Velcro does the job pretty well and offers better ventilation. The only shortcoming is the Velcro for the knees. It seems a bit short for the top strap. I measure the maximum it can fit 10cm above the knee is a circumference of 42 cm. I think that is a important point to note when purchasing this item.

They kept falling down, and the kids weren't the least bit interested in wearing them, and they are truly very safety conscious. After realizing they were way too big for them, I tried them on, and they fit me! They are really nice knee pads, but definitely not for little kids.

The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads...except that they are even tighter than the knee pads; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off...I'll probably never use the elbow pads again. The knee pads at least do an okay job at protecting my knees (so long as they stay on) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents.

They would easily fit someone larger too (but probably not a large muscular male---he might be able to wear the kneepads as elbow pads though!). They have stretch velco straps so the size is adjustable. The velcro straps are comfortable, not so tight that they cut off circulation. I like them a LOT better than my old ones, which were not straps but stretchy elastic and hard to get on and off, especially if one was sweating! These are simple, fast and easy to put on and take off. These seem well-made; I've had them for about a month (with usage 3 times a week, for biking) and I expect them to last a long while----but even if they didn't, at this price it's affordable to replace them.
