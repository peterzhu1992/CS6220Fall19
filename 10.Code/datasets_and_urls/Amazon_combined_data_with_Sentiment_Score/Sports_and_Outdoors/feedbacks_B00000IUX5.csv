He doesn't like it when it moves on him, though, so we always put something on either side of it so it can't roll around.",4,use it for a dog tunnel,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",0.119
1,A17HW12VKRBSSU,B00000IUX5,intotheblues,"[2, 2]","My friend has this for her son, and her new puppy fell in love with it, so I thought I might try it for my new girl. So, I bought this for my 10 week old puppy - she just loves it. It took her a minute to get used to it, but now she'll go out of her way to run through it. So far its held up quite nicely to puppy chewing, running etc. What I really love is that is sooo easy to fold up. I can put it away in a minute and when she's ready to play I can just pop it open. So much fun - plus its big enough that she'll be able to play with it long into her growing stages. Very fun toy! Not sure if kids of the human variety enjoy it as much as the furry ones, but I recommend it if you have a playful puppy!",5,Puppy Loves It!,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",0.6108
2,A3VSMUBKY8HYB2,B00000IUX5,JackieVT,"[0, 0]","I originally bought this on the advice of people who train puppies in agility skills. Their suggestion was to not buy agility tunnels, but instead, find a decent & afforable tunnel in kid toys. I went with this tunnel based in other buyer reviews and now it's time I add my own review.I have a now 26 week old pup and didn't want to invest too much in materials if agility ended up not being her cup of tea. As I said, this tunnel came with good reviews for durability and the price was right.Well, turns out she loves training to go through this tunnel, so I just ordered a second one to extend the length. I love that option! and it's one of the main reasons I went with this particular tunnel.Now, to be real: I never leave the tunnel out for her to just play with. I am sure she would ruin it ... after all, she is still a pup with a big chew & destroy drive. Fortunately, this tunnel is easy to set up & take down.So for those of you thinking about dog agility training - or not - this product worked out well for me and I can recommend it.",5,Perfect tunnel for training my energetic puppy!,1331769600,"03 15, 2012",0.2288

Once it was over I wanted to get some agility items for our yard so he could continue trainig, but the kits made especially for this were a bit expensive for what you got. We got this for the tunnel and our dog loves using it for agility exercise.",5,Works great for training my dog on agility,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",0.3904
