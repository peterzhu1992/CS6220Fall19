0,A31CDJ0LTU6PCB,B00004U9J9,Adam Greenberg,"[0, 0]",This is the best knife I ever had.I wasn't certain spending so much on a pocket knife would be worth it but it was.It is solid and large. It flicks open easily and locks up firmly. The blade stays sharp. It continues to work like and look like new. You can easily operate it with one hand while you hold what you are cutting in the other.The sharpened tip proves very useful for opening packages. The serrated part of the blade is good for cutting plastic ties.,5,My all time favorite knife.,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",0.4414

2,A26VCXQU8MLCK9,B00004U9J9,circawdm ArtDealerPro,"[1, 1]","I own several other SOG knives. This is the largest I have. It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring flip out operation. This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others. But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand. It is a quality looking knife.As usual with all SOG knives, the steel holds a very sharp edge and is strong. The handle has a good feel to the grip and everything about it is quality.I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I won't need it. If I should need it however, it's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products. This is a more handsome looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades, but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner.",5,A Lovely Precision Knife For The Money,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",0.3332
3,AUCISQA1YXX86,B00004U9J9,Confederate,"[1, 6]","Double bladed, my only gripe is the blade's a tad short. Most manufacturers of great knives don't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges, but SOG. The characteristics of this knife make it a good fighting knife, but a little on the smallish side. Take a look at the Cold Steel Voyager with a 5- or 6-inch blade for not a whole lot more money. Chances are you'll drop this one in a heartbeat.Free shipping on knives would be great, too, but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife! I keep hoping free shipping will become the wave of the future in Internet sales. At least on smaller items.",4,Excellent Knife,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",0.2065
4,AGGAQLXPVGM5D,B00004U9J9,Eagle Vision,"[1, 1]","INTROI needed a utility knife for deployments, and since I went to Haiti, I found this to be the perfect tool. The knife clip is secure and is stable on my web belt (It is reversible, if you are a left handed user). The weight of this knife is evenly balanced.CONSTRUCTION AND USEThe blade has a serrated edge for cutting through hard material very easily. The Shark Tooth Tip adds to its potential use for defense, as well as for its ability to cut anything with ease. This looks like a double edged knife, but it is not - only the tip is. The knife is razor sharp and resists corrosion. The matte finish is useful to eliminate glare or for avoiding bringing attention to its user, if unsheathed. The handle is durable, textured and feels comfortable in my hand.Action of the blade is smooth, and allows for quick one-handed operation. The lock is secure and given the smooth action of the mechanism, it allows for one handed closure, also. I can open this knife one-handed in about 1 second.PROSQuickly opensShark tooth tipGreat balanceLifetime warrantySerrated edge for tough materials to cutCONSNone, in my opinionSUMMARYOne of the best utility/tactical knives in the market. Highly recommend.",5,Great utility knife,1266105600,"02 14, 2010",0.3763

The blades are both VG-10 steel, which is very sharp and holds an edge fairly well. They make a nice set and are both superb knives. The Pentagon Elite is serrated and has a dagger like appearance. Open easily and looks fierce. I prefer the 4 inch blades since the 5 inch are illegal to carry in most areas.",5,Excellent companion to my Spec Elite,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",0.2232
6,A29L0C6ZHA50C,B00004U9J9,Joe A!,"[0, 0]",I originally purchased this knife as a backup or emergency use knife but it has been an EDC knife for about a month now and performed extremely well. The steel holds its edge very well and out of the box I only touched it up with a leather strap to polish the edge a little. I have yet to perform harsh tasks or try to abuse it but the steel eats everything I throw at it. In comparison the Cold Steel Hold Out III started to dull after opening 15-20 envelopes where as the Pentagon Elite didn't start to loose its edge until 45 envelopes and breaking down three boxes. The edge only lost its super fine edge and it only took a few minutes on a leather strap to get it back.The steel used in this knife has me sold and I will never purchase a knife with anything less AUS8 is terrible compared to this.,5,Excellent knife,1321920000,"11 22, 2011",0.0122
7,A1F92EK0MUNOVR,B00004U9J9,Pecos Bill,"[37, 38]","Great knife. I think it's skirting the lines of legality in my state because you can flip it open, but it's not a gravity knife -- it holds itself closed and it has a locking mechanism to hold the blade open, so it seems to fit within the letter of the law.The shark tooth tip is a neat design idea that gives it a VERY sharp point, there are serrated edges towards the handle that help out if you're trying to cut through something like twine or wires, it has a belt clip if you're toting it around as a utility knife but is also small enough to easily fit within your pocket.If you're looking for a good utility buck knife you might as well get something like this. The flipping action and one-finger lock disengage means you can easily use it one handed and it seems rugged enough for everyday use in the tool belt. No more dropping what you're doing so you can pry the blade out or safely close it, just a little wrist and thumb action will do it.Edit:I've had this knife for almost 2 years now and I still like it. I use it frequently (primarily for cutting open boxes from Amazon... *cough*) and can't get enough of the wrist action on it. It's so nice to be able to open and close it without having to pry the blade out 2-handed style like other utility knives. Can't say I can really comment on the whole knife fighting aspect other reviewers mention (don't do much knife fighting myself... you know... busy busy...) but as a simple utility knife, it's hard to beat. Still sharp, too.Edit 2 (Dec 2007) --Still have the knife. Still like it. Another reviewer said this knife was double bladed (I assume that means sharp on both sides) but it's not. You might think it was from looking at the picture, but mine, which I ordered from this page a few years ago, is only sharp on the bottom, with the exception of the shark tooth tip, which is sharp on both sides, but only for a distance of like 1/8 or so (the very sharp tip is great for getting started on those highly annoying, nearly invulnerable hard plastic packages everything comes in these days).",5,Awesome Knife,1076457600,"02 11, 2004",0.3572
8,A2MGXC5NAYZYMC,B00004U9J9,Preston B. Miller AKgoodtimes,"[0, 0]","The action is smooth and one handed, the blade is razor sharp. The blade is rock solid when in extended position, no wobble. The pocket clip is rock solid, unlike other knives I have owned. I literally shaved my leg with it, no razor burn!!! Now I walk around with a bald spot on my leg. I also own the big brother of this knife, the pentagon elite II, they are the best folding knives I've ever owned. I would recommend them with enthusiasm.",5,This knife rocks!,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",0.1177
