1,A89ZZKNDFQH23,B00005R2GR,Delaney,"[4, 5]","The 6 piece set was more than I actuallly needed, but I didn't know where I was going to mount the speed bag and so I got the whole kit. The speed bag is really good quality and the swivel is better than I thought it was going to be. It is nice to have both the wrap and the gloves if you are a beginner because you may find that one suits you better than the other. I did not end up using the platform but the frame leads me to believe that it is very sturdy. The jump rope, ah, the jump rope is a nice touch and it is nice to have, but i's nothing special.If you are looking for a fun and challenging arm workout the speed bag is a lot of fun to learn. It is not about punching something as hard as you can it is about controlling your punch. I like it, it's fun and it's a really good outlet on very bad days.",4,Quality Product,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",0.4113
2,A18F6EPN8MVV3Q,B00005R2GR,Dr. Mike,"[4, 4]","The first problem is that I finally have time to put the thing up and when I read the instructions, I quickly found that the most important item for assembly is NOT INCLUDED. I had to get 6 lag bolts before even assembling the thing. Of course it was late and the hardware store was closed - very frustrating. The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating. For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it. For more advanced boxers, spend a little more and upgrade all parts.Skipping rope is garbage - way too lightweight. Wraps are not flexible and too short. Bag gloves are unnecessary.",2,everlast speed bag good for beginners only,1216771200,"07 23, 2008",-0.0251
3,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B00005R2GR,magellan,"[19, 23]","This set includes the speed bag and mounting platform, speed bag training gloves, hand wraps, and a jump rope. I'm mainly a karate and kung-fu student and teacher, but I've done some boxing too, and one of the best exercises you can learn to enhance speed and agility is the classic boxing workout on the speed bag. More martial artists should use this great training tool. I never got to the point where I could mix in things like elbow strikes and head butts in-between punches like the real experts, but I got pretty good just hitting it with straight punches and back hammerfists and could really get it going that way. If you're going to try this, keep your shoulders loose and try to hit with proper rhythm and timing--those are the key elements. Don't try to go real hard and fast in the beginning, as you'll only be able to hit it once or twice before you miss. Start slow and build up from there. Altogether a great training for martial artists of all styles and stripes.The jump rope is a nice extra although perhaps not as essential for karate students. That's because a boxer is poised on the balls of his feet, and his most powerful punch is the hook, which travels in an arc. A karate thrust punch is just the opposite. Karateists punch flat-footed and the punch is from the hips and travels in a straight line, so the karateist isn't always bouncing around on the balls of his feet like a boxer. He's more likely to shift stances and move only when necessary to adjust distance, although that depends on the individual fighter, too.Overall, a useful set and at a reasonable price for the quality and features offered.",5,Great training aid,1056067200,"06 20, 2003",0.3995
4,AFHYEO3Y1IIDD,B00005R2GR,maximum verbosity,"[0, 0]","My 16 year old son is interested in boxing so I thought this might be a nice starter kit for him to practice with. The boxing gloves aren't that great, but they serve their purpose. The bag and platform are fine....I had enough sense to know it wouldn't come with screws and stuff, so we bought what we needed before installing it. Found a strong beam in the wall in the garage and it was up and ready to go in 20 minutes. He really enjoys using it (as does my husband) and so far, it appears to be of decent quality and perfect for what we wanted - a home speed bag set that wouldn't break the bank, but wouldn't break during use either.",4,Works for us!,1259884800,"12 4, 2009",0.3677
5,AE6LN80KUHS5I,B00005R2GR,Ryan Tenorio,"[0, 0]","this is a great kit to get all the items you need for a speed bag set. there is one bad thing about this set, but there is an easy fix. the swivel shown in the picture is NOT the one included in set. the one included in set is a cheap plastic base, with a plastic ball bearing, and a small metal i hook glued into the bearing, with a small spring clip attached to hang tour bag on. of course that wasn't going to fly so i upgraded to the Everlast Professional Speedbag Swivel and it made things great. the next thing after you get good at it is to upgrade to a smaller bag. the bag included is way to big. after you upgrade these two things its a great set and well worth the money.",4,good speed bag but needs better swivel,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",0.3586
