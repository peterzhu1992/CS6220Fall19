0,AVUOSNTRBY6ZT,B00004WA57,Dave C,"[1, 2]","I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years. I have lots of knives, as I'm a collector but this is my go-to blade for just about anything from fishing to cutting up boxes. For the price, it's hard to get a better knife. I still use my old one after 15 years, even though my wife bought me this new one last Christmas. There's no reason to ever second guess whether or not you should buy this knife. It's a no brainer. The newer one changed ever so slightly, but for all practical purposes it's the same one I've been using all these years. Just get it.......trust me!",5,Great Knife,1352764800,"11 13, 2012",-0.0526

2,A1LK41PI1152HK,B00004WA57,Jeff,"[8, 9]","I have gone through 3 of these over the course of 15 years and I am about to order number 4. I had one of the older ones with the solid blade, not the skeleton type. I liked that one best and wish they still made that type. I lost it in a movie theater 10 years ago and I still miss it to this day. I bought another one and lost it somewhere in Appalachia. I bought a third one and loaned it to a friend who offered to sharpen it for me before returning it. When I got it back the handle was severely damaged, like he had tried to pry it apart or something, but I got another 5 years of use out of it before it finally broke. Even so, the blade is still in excellent condition, razor sharp, and I will keep it for spare parts.It's one of the most useful tools I have ever owned. I never feel right without one. It is slender and sits nice and flat in your pocket, which means it's comfortable enough go everywhere with you, which means you will always have your knife when you need it. It flips out smoothly, locks tightly, and keeps a nice edge. Every other comparable folder I have tried has been too bulky or heavy compared to the E-Z Out. This knife just feels right and I highly recommend it.",5,Long time fan,1297209600,"02 9, 2011",0.1903
3,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B00004WA57,jjceo,"[3, 4]","I have carried a knife of this design for over 17 years. It is an outstanding quality knife and my oldest one (A model Gerber 450, 1995 Production Run) looks new after 17 years of carrying it. Gerber stainless is the best and the knife holds an edge well. I like the easy open one hand design using the thumb oval hole in the blade and you can open it with either hand. I have big hands and the handle is large enough that I can securely hold it when working and I like the Kraton rubber inserts that improve your grip.Locking blade knives are the safest as the blade will not accidently close on your hand while you are working. I love the serrated edge to cut tough items but yet you still have the smooth edge of the knife for more precision work. I carry mine in my pocket but it does have a stainless steel belt clip on it.The 3 inch blade is the right size to work in the yard, garage, hiking or hunting with and yet still carry in inconspicuously in your pocket. It is lightweight but big enough to get the job done when you need a full size knife.",5,My favorite pocket knife design!,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",0.4209
4,A3IZJ733D99RNT,B00004WA57,Matt S.,"[0, 0]","I am not a knife guru, but I've owned about 6 throughout the last 10 years. This knife is the best I've bought in the price range. Sharp enough out of the box to cut up small game without frustration and can make short work of a deer. I recently bought another so I could keep one in my car and truck, for the price its justifiable to buy one to leave in the vehicle for emergency use.Happy to say it puts a great edge back on, I actually use an Accusharp knife sharpener for the straight edge, and picked up a Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener to handle the serrated edge (both on Amazon). I'm pleased with both of those products as well, I usually just use a stone to sharpen but these do a better job in less time.I purchased a straight Buck knife for around $70, and have found that it does a better job in cutting up larger game. If you are an avid hunter, I would recommend looking into a Buck, as it does noticeably cut my time and work down in the field. For rabbits, squirrels and the like I always go to this knife.",5,Great knife for the price,1314576000,"08 29, 2011",0.4273

Quality wise it does NOT come close to a SPYDERCO knife, but I love the skeleton blade, I loce the price and I love the fact that it is VERY light!!Good purchase.",4,Great knife at a GREAT price.,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",0.6185
6,AAW7X3GRD8GY9,B00004WA57,S. Barrett,"[0, 0]","I spent quite some time researching and trying to find a pocket knife that I liked that was made in the USA. Unfortunately the information about that is very sketchy online. This one doesn't say it anywhere, so I took a chance and got lucky that it had the Portland, OR stamp on the blade. I have been using it for several months now and have absolutely no complaints about it. I love the cut outs on the blade for one handed opening vs. the typical thumb posts. It fits in my pocket very well and was extremely well sharpened when it arrived.",5,Excellent blade that is made in the USA.,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",0.3592
7,A3OB8U8362U5XV,B00004WA57,survivorman25,"[0, 0]","This was my first knife, (the original version with only one thumb hole), and it's served me well for the past ten years. I loved it so much that a couple of years ago I bought the fine edge skeleton model. This knife is perfect for everyday carry. It's light, and the name EZ out fits it perfectly. My original one has been worked with for a decade, so it opens faster than I can describe, but the second one I bought came out of the box, and since I knew what I'm was doing this time,could open it just as quickly.It's light, has a comfortable grip, and a sturdy easy to use pocket clip. (It's not one of those you have to force like my wife's Buck Bantam, it just slides into place and holds securely there). The skeleton model is even easier to open with one hand than the original which only had one thumb hole. This knife is great when you need quick access and one handed opening capability. Perfect pocket knife, and razor sharp out of the box. Plus this is one of the few Gerber knives still made in America.But it's also tough enough to handle field dressing. I've gutted deer with this, and had no trouble at all. I've since switched to the Gerber Gator 2 with a gut hook since I'm now able to afford a few knives, but the EZ out was a great starter blade. I still carry my first one on small game hunts, and the second one clips onto the shoulder strap of my backpack/camelbak during hikes in case I need a quick weapon to fight off a bear.If I had use for a third one I'd buy it in a heartbeat. It will be the first knife my sons carry.",5,Great Knife,1344556800,"08 10, 2012",0.4697
8,A3K201M6E3CSJL,B00004WA57,TedW,"[0, 0]","Awesome Sharp knife. Had the old version for about 10 years and never needed to sharpen. It was not the skeleton like this but they do not make the non-skeleton version anymore of this. My old Gerber disappeared one day and I was sick about it, had a lot of memories tied to that knife. LOL...So decided to get this updated version of the model called the e-z out skeleton that they are selling now. SHARP, HOLDS an Edge and just kicks bottom. Took about a week to get use to flipping the blade out with one hand and thumb but now have that mastered.Love this knife so much keep it beside the bed at night and it is the first thing I look for when getting dressed in the morning.",5,Awesome Knife - Well Built - Gerber did it again,1350259200,"10 15, 2012",0.017

I always have it with me and believe me when I say it is extremely easy out.
