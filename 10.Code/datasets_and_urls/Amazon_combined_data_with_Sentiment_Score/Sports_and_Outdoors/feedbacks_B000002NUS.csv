On my first use, the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one. I will never buy anything with Outers written on it. I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit.",1,The worst kit out there,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",-0.0609

It is nice that each attachment has its own spot to snap into, and there are additional spots to accommodate additional things like solvent and patches.",5,A very complete kit.,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",0.4479

After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs, I opted to send it back. The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap kit. I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back. What a disappointment.",1,"Missing parts, Cheaply made",1361059200,"02 17, 2013",-0.0742

10,A2QRSLA0V1GZFW,B000002NUS,Lars O Flynn,"[0, 0]","My regular gun cleaning kit is the size of a foot locker and too bulky to take on trips in a small car. So I wanted something more transportable. This is a nice kit, it's got everything the average shooter would need with multiple calibers. There's even a couple spots inside for other things. One holds Hoppes #9 quite well but I can't get the bottle of gun oil to fit in it. Still I would recommend this for home or travel.",5,Handy for traveling,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",0.1094

12,A1L541UBV96TH8,B000002NUS,M. White,"[0, 0]",These kits are amazing if you have multiple guns and calibers to clean. It has everything you need in terms of brushes and jags. I also buy these to refill my larger unit since it is cheaper ordering it this way than individual brushes and rods.,5,Slam-cleaning-fantastic,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",0.2526
13,A18AHY846D1AOA,B000002NUS,Rock,"[0, 0]","used it for a year or so and definitely have had to buy better equipment. the skinny cleaning rod- snapped.. the thicker cleaning rod- also snapped. i'm not one to apply heavy force on these, they're just very soft/cheap. the brushes are decent enough. after spending cash on a nicer kit, i guess i learned my lesson. if you have the funds skip and buy something a little nicer.",2,spend the extra money on a better kit,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",0.2552
14,A17GO98TO5OUF4,B000002NUS,SeraElizabeth,"[9, 9]","Most notable is that it doesn't contain everything you might need and it is missing some calibers that are not entirely uncommon --- there is no provision for .40 for example.The individual components are not made of the strongest materials, but then you don't have to worry about any of them damaging your rifling. It is a really nice size overall and the container is pretty good. Some items may shake loose into other parts of the case, but they never fall out entirely. The extra room between some of the items is also pretty good for storing hex keys and what-not.The lid latches very securely on both sides and the rods snap very securely easily in and out on the top. Everything in the bottom is loose.Not the cleaning kit for the connoisseur; but a nice economic kit for the hobbyist that has guns in a number of different common calibers. Pretty good for under $30.(Also, the shotgun mops and brushes are actually on opposite sides from the picture; obviously not a big deal and since they are the same size they can pretty much be re-arranged but the mops are actually bigger and have slightly larger slots in the middle. If you try to make it match the picture then the mops might smoosh a little)Complete list of contents:Thin rod set (for .17 and .22)Freely rotating brass rod with handle - rod length 8&#34;10.5&#34; extension x2 (28&#34; fully assembled useable length)Thick rod setFreely rotating brass rod with handle -rod length 8&#34;10.5&#34; extension x2 (28&#34; fully assembled useable length)Thin rod to thick rod adapter (required for the .22) you could possibly use the thick rods to clean a 22 but it would bump against the edges of the barrel for sure.

It does work great and you can eye which item you need to clean your firearm because the items in the cleaning kit are not marked for what caliber that it is for.
