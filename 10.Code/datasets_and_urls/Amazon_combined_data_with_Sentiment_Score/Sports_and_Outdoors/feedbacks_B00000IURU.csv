The perfect size for a few kids and adults and super sturdy; we had some future s/he-mans yanking on the handles with all their might. Play some music and do freeze dance, have the kids try to all run under before it goes down, are they fast enough? Other fun games - through some ball on top and don't let them bounce off. There are probably many more ideas out there if you search the world wide web of fun. Now I am waiting for another turn where we have enough people over to use it.",5,Perfect for the 3-6 yr old crowd,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",,0.4569

I think the fabric quality is good, and was what I expected. It has a little vent in the middle so that kids can put it all the way to the floor sitting in it and the air won't get stuffy. The 10 feet doesn't seem like much until you actually get it out, it's a surprising nice size.",5,Awesome Fort,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",Amazon Customer,0.3674

Putting a ball on the top and letting them bounce it out is a fun game. Or bouncing the ball and trying to keep it on the parachute for a more difficult game. This one is not quite big enough to walk under and pull it down while you are inside. Well it would work for small kids, not with an adult in the group.",5,Group fun toy,1283212800,"08 31, 2010",M.

I admit that it's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute. It will be a big hit at any party, playgroup, or get together. All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast. It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play; turn taking, cooperation, and collective participation. I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play. Get outside and have a blast!",5,great fun!,1032480000,"09 20, 2002",S. Lipson,0.4751
5,A2SPV96SGOEO2,B00000IURU,"[9, 11]","This parachute is a lot of fun! Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it, but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down. He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction.This one is bigger than I thought it would be, which is a good thing, but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home. If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around. But if you have only 3 people to play with, while it still works, it's more fun with more people. But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be!Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids!",5,My kids love it!,1129593600,"10 18, 2005",The Travelin' Hrncirs,0.585
