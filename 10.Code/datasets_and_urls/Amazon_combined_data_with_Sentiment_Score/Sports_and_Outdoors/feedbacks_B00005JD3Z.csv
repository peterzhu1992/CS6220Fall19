0,A2AXWQVA5V9GPJ,B00005JD3Z,A. Benenson,"[2, 2]","It works fine for blowing up my queen air mattress, but it has two problems. First, the on/off switch can easily be bumped into the ON position while the pump is being transported, which will run down the battery (to fix that I flip around one of the batteries when I'm not using it). Second, rarely the pump just quits in the middle of use; shaking it or bumping it starts it up again. Overall this is nothing special but it gets the job done.",3,Can turn on accidentally (and sometimes stops unexpectedly),1341705600,"07 8, 2012",-0.1209

This made short work of inflating the mattress and did a really good job.If you get a air mattress, do yourself a favor and get a battery powered air pump, you won't by unhappy you did.",5,"Works great, much better than using the hand pump.",1393545600,"02 28, 2014",0.6486

I have not used it yet, but it replaces an identical one that we lost along the way somehow, and that one was perfect, so I expect no less from this one.",5,Camp Necessity - If Air Mattresses Are,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",0.2442
4,A1JF3Y1GQSTRLO,B00005JD3Z,M. Link pmvvlink,"[0, 0]",This works good a little slower than an electric pump but better than nothing. It took about 5 to 10 to fill queen size.,5,Works,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",0.3502
5,A8TO8GDVZ5G5Z,B00005JD3Z,N Gogol Mark,"[1, 1]","The pump works fine. Filled the bed in about a minute. But if I need another (or a replacement) I'd get one that works on household AC power. This needs 4 D cells. Since I expect to use it only occasionally, the batteries might be dead by then.Of course, running on batteries is better during a power outage ... but, come to think of it, I don't need any power to sleep in my bed. (Just to get up, some mornings.)Since I've only used it once, I can't attest to relaibility.",4,Good pump; better if it worked on AC,1323302400,"12 8, 2011",0.0035
6,A3LVZEIKCSOJET,B00005JD3Z,rvrguyd,"[0, 1]",The Coleman 4 D Battery Quick Pump takes 4 D-size batteries which will give you loads of time to blow up a mattress but the darn thing is loud and sounds like the bearings are bad. Right out of the box this thing sounded like it was going to burn up or seize. The volume of air expelled is fine for blowing up a bed but I would not recommend that it be used to blow up a raft. The unit just doesn't have the pressure/power to even do a bicycle tire although it is not intended for that purpose.,2,Coleman 4 D Battery QuickPump,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",-0.1037
7,A2TI79NM4NCEUI,B00005JD3Z,smartydog904 bluedog,"[1, 1]","Yes D batteries can be expensive, but my name brand batteries seem to last a long time. Plus the ability to take it anywhere is a BIG plus. My pump works just great on the 4 in 1 Coleman mattress. Inflated both in under 2 minutes. Deflation even faster. Remember, sometimes you get a dud, try again. I got lucky and got a great pump at a great price. I have tried those aero type beds, and not for me. Uncomfortable, heavy, must have a plug near by to inflate. I'm spur of the moment, so this travel pump is just perfect! p.s. it's advertised as a 4D pump, so you know before you buy it takes D batteries, so if you don't want the weight by a bike pump!!",5,Very Quick Travel pump!,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",0.1466
