2,A36CZ3BAN75PD1,B0000643KA,Cherston,"[0, 0]","I got this thermos as a christmas present (2012) and decided to try it out to see how long it held hot water. I placed boiling water in the thermos at 11am and it was STILL boiling hot at Midnight. Yes it is made in China, but I have not had any problems with the lid. Just make sure you don't screw the cap on too tightly and you should be fine. You don't even have to completely remove the cap either since it has slots for pouring liquid. One reason it kept the water hot so long. If you put soup in it that has veggies in it, then you would need to remove the entire cap. The only drawback is that the Lid that acts as a cup holds less than one cup. Other than that it is a great product. No glass inside to break either which is a plus too.",5,Great Thermos,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",0.1432
3,AU8ED357LR5GW,B0000643KA,CtrlAltDlt,"[4, 6]","The original model i was looking for (24oz food jar) was sold out everywhere, so i picked this one up. I was impressed by the labeling that promised to keep liquids hot for 24hrs.First thing i did was a temp test with boiling water. 8pm: preheat bottle and fill with boiling liquid. Sealed Securely. 8am next morning (12hrs in a typical work day): Water is room temperature. I might as well have left it in a plastic container. The packaging explicitly says it will keep liquids hot for 24hrs and cold for 32hrs. This seems to be false. I did several leak tests, did the test all over again, with the same result. Water is cold by the time i open the bottle 12 hours later.I did notice that this bottle becomes noticeably warm to the touch after being filled with the liquid. For an insulated bottle, it seems to be giving off a lot more heat than it should...i dunno...be insulating?Any time you introduce cost-cutting into manufacturing (such as outsourcing to china) you probably lose out on some consistency, which is why a few customer here have reported duds. I am likely the recipient of a lemon. I cant say for sure that the claims Stanley-pmi makes are false, but in my experience there is a large gap between the quality Stanley advertises and what it delivers.",1,"Hugely Dissapointed, Returning.",1233014400,"01 27, 2009",0.0999
4,A36VJZIJVQCF7H,B0000643KA,David Smith doctorjn,"[11, 14]","This thermos is one of Stanley's famous vacuum flask thermoses. Vacuum flask technology is the best technology for preventing thermal attrition (keeping your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold). I enjoy my coffee very hot and my water ice cold. When I received this I tested it and found that it kept my coffee nice and hot (not lukewarm) for over 2 days! As for cold, it had ice in my ice water in it after almost 3 days (and I live in the south where it's warm).The entire bottle is stainless steel. It is double-walled, with a vacuum between the steel walls. The screw-on stopper seals very nicely and is made of a very strong plastic, it seems very solid. The cup fits well and is solid plastic with chrome on the outside. Stanley also has a reputation for standing behind their products and offer a lifetime guarantee. It's pretty much impossible to beat the quality of a Stanley and a warranty like that. I am a student and also enjoy the outdoors, and my Stanley is a companion with me everywhere. I always have fresh coffee or tea piping hot. I almost never leave home without it because it is so useful!On camping trips you can also fill it with clean super-hot water and you can put oatmeal in the cup or in a bowl and have an instant hot meal. This thermos performs excellent in the winter too. I left mine outside in my car overnight in sub-freezing weather and the next morning I didn't have time to make more coffee and put it in. When I got to school, I figured = what the heck, I'll see if it's warm - to my surprise is was nice and hot and ready to drink!Here are some specifics on the Stanley Thermos that you might find useful:Thermos:Height: 14 inchesDiameter: 4 inchesCircumference: 12-2/5 inchesComposition of interior: Stainless SteelComposition of exterior: Stainless SteelComposition of Top/Stopper: Plastic/PolymerComposition of Cap/Cup: Plastic/PolymerThermal Attrition Resistance: VacuumMaximum Capacity (Volume): 1 Quart (32 fluid ounces or 1/4 Gallon)Country of Origin: Made in China (not USA, sadly).Cleaning Method: Hand Wash Only [Not Dishwasher Safe]Not Microwave Safe - Do Not MicrowaveGuarantee: Lifetime GuaranteeI must say that I am impressed with the quality and innovativeness of the design. It is definitely a must-have for students, in offices and commuting to work, on the job where ruggedness is required, and out on the trail. The only drawback I see is that it is made in China instead of the U.S.A. Personally, I'd happily pay double the price for one that was made in U.S.A. In any case, a good Stanley product is worth the investment. I am very happy with the product.",5,Stanley is Still the World Standard for Thermoses!,1210291200,"05 9, 2008",0.4106
5,AHS6PX6H22WW1,B0000643KA,H. Wang jwangamazon,"[2, 7]","This bottle is a little pricy. But it does what it claims. It preserves hot water temperature very well. I didn't try the cold temperature. The construction is very solid for high impact resistent (good for portability). I have no doubt that it will last for many many years. In all, I am happy with the quality of this bottle. But, I will take 1 star out due to its premium price.",4,Good quality. Do what it claims. But pricy.,1168387200,"01 10, 2007",0.2213
6,A13S0N4A4ZEKZH,B0000643KA,Inspector Nash Bridges,"[0, 0]","I have seen the bad reviews. Do I believe them? Yes. There probably are vacuum flask bottles that did not work. For what reason? I do not know.But just like buying a car, sometimes you get a lemon. Quality control should be better at the factory. I suppose they just do not have the resources to fill every bottle with hot water, then see if the bottle actually kept the water hot for 24 hours. They should though. These days, most products get a visual inspection at best.But not every item is defective. I've had no complaints with mine. From working double shifts to long road trips, my bottle has kept my coffee hot.For my personal use, my beverages go into the bottle at a boiling hot temperature. I will add boiling water to my bottle with a couple of teabags, and my tea will stay hot for well over 24 hours. I brew my coffee with a percolater on top of an induction cooktop. Sometimes I like to add boiling hot water into a French press.Boiling hot liquid going in stays hot for a very long time. If you are using an electric drip coffee pot, like a Mr. Coffee, then you didn't start off with very hot coffee to begin with. The boiling point of water is 100 C (212 F). Coffee shops typically keep retail coffee at or about 82 C (180 F). An inexpensive home drip coffee maker will be even lower in temperature (which usually results in a poor cup of coffee).

I picked one up a few days ago and was shocked at how light and flimsy it is. While it may look like the old American made Stanley, it is just a veneer of it's old self and absolute Chinese junk not built to last.I am so disappointed to see once great American companies succumb to the economic pressure of building junk.

It sat next to me in the blind, with a temperature that wavered between high 30s and low 40s all day. The coffee stayed hot all day, and the last cup was still warm when I got home 13 hours later.

As with others I have noted a much lighter product and one that simply does not keep hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.PMI, the people that bought Aladdin, really have no idea how to make things. Apparently all they do is design the product and pray to God that the contract manufacturer across the pond is building the product correctly. PMI should have kept the Aladdin factory open and the same people in place, but they decided to ship the job to China and charge the same price. Quality suffered big time folks.Instead of fooling with the warranty, I bought a vintage one off of ebay. The quality is night and day. The vintage stanleys were truly built to last.

However I feel the main value of reviews is to try and get an accurate sense of the quality, reliability and dependability of a product before you buy it. Cost is also a factor as is most important ;the product warranty and how the company handles it.This product is a classic example of something I would quickly purchase based on their prior reputation.I have a 38 year old stainless steel foam insulated vacuum bottle that needs replacement. I said to a friend in the ice shanty &#34;It's time for a new Stanley.&#34;However after shopping here I will have to alter that statement.Almost 30 % of the reviews are 3 stars or less which means a lot of unhappy purchasers who thought they were buying traditional American quality and not new Chinese trash.Like any wise buyer I am willing to pay a little more for quality and reputation but no stupid enough to buy junk.

I bought a new one up here. Made in China and you can tell. It's not as heavy as my old one. There is a visible weld seam in the China version on the inside. It does NOT stay hot or cold like it claims. My old one lasted about 18 hours in the winter with coffee. Still steaming. This one...about 10. Disappointed, but I knew better than to buy things made in China. Stanley, I thought you had a lifetime customer here, but you dropped the ball. For what I need, the thermos will work.
