THESE ARE MORE COMPACT-HAVE A BETTER FIELD OF VIEW-AND ARE AT LEAST HALF THE COST OF OTHER BRANDS. I CAN SEE CACTUS NEEDLES AT 50+ YARDS. SOMEONE NEEDS TO CONVINCE ME THAT HIGHER PRICED OPTICS ARE SUPERIOR IN PERFORMANCE...THEN MAYBE I'LL RISK DROPPING THEM OVERBOARD.,5,good features-excellent value,1333238400,"04 1, 2012",0.4238
1,AT3TTS2XITSI6,B00004SAKY,Jerry Plott,"[0, 0]","I ordered these because I wanted a pair to carry in my vehicle that were small, but powerful enough to be useful. The glass quality is very good considering the price and is appropriate for what I wanted them for. Obviously the glass is not comparable to higher end optics, but these are great if you want a small pair that are reasonably price.",5,Excellent value for the price!,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",0.7031
2,A1ECCLQC6FH2FD,B00004SAKY,Mike,"[3, 3]","I have been a photographer for over 45 years and am very familiar with the quality of Nikon's optics. However, I own both the Nikon 10x25 and the Bushnell 12x25 binoculars and in terms of clarity I find no discernible difference between the two, except the Bushnell has a bit more power. The Bushnell's are also much smaller than the Nikon so they take up less space when you are packing for a trip. Considering they cost $30 less than Nikon's, and are stronger, the choice is clear...buy the Bushnell every time. A great pair of small binoculars.",5,Bushnell 12x25 vs. Nikon 10x25,1314921600,"09 2, 2011",0.2269

Carbo WDC,"[0, 0]","I have nothing bad to say about these binoculars.I use them at work to watch ships movements in and out of the bay.They are light, easy to handle, and are clear during bad weather.Good optics. You can't go wrong.I have dropped them once. A fall of about 3 feet - all is well!",5,I spy with my Big eyes...,1354320000,"12 1, 2012",0.3103
