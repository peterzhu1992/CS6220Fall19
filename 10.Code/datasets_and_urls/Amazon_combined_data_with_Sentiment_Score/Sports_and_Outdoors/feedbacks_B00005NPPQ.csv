0,A55OWI53KJ4KZ,B00005NPPQ,Abby507vc,"[0, 0]","Ordered this recently for a party. This new film printed pictures that were obviously brighter and clearer than the first cartridge of over-year-old film we had opened and used first that night. I almost ordered a whole bunch to set aside, but now I'm glad I didn't because the difference in quality makes it clear that fresher film produces better pictures. From now on I plan to order what I need even though the more you order the cheaper it is per picture. Everyone has so much fun with these pictures - there's something about a tangible print that digital can't compete with. Highly recommend this product and hope they never stop making it!",5,Love this film!,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",0.5043

6,AGOH8N902URMW,B00005NPPQ,Zeb zebra01,"[0, 0]",Polaroid let all of this go several years ago. Yet in reality the market had not died buy had gotten a lot smaller. Fuji has kept making all of the professional films -n which are just outstanding and stunning in quality.The'Impossible' makes the films for the polaroid consumer products - but they ar vexingly more complex than the FUJI instant films.,5,Like the Polaroid.,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",0.3185
