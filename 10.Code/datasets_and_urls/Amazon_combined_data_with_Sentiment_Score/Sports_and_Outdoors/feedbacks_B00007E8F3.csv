0,AT1T9DMR7V5W6,B00007E8F3,**** be fair ****,"[0, 0]",Excellent but without a Saw I had to exchange it for the bulkier &#34;Champion Plus&#34; model which is the best value for money I believe.,5,If only had a Saw :(,1366243200,"04 18, 2013",0.9052
1,A18RZ5Z6XECUNN,B00007E8F3,Mark A. Lingle Amazon Rules!!!,"[0, 0]",Always wanted a Swiss Army Knife and now I have one! didn't want anything too big nor too little! Grew up watching McGyver on TV and always said I need one but never pulled the trigger to buy it. Searched many models on Amazon but felt this was the one that was calling to me! Glad I picked this one because I love it!,5,Perfect knife for the price!,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",0.1698

The scissors are particularly handy, and I also find myself using the Phillips head screwdriver accessory all the time. I always have one of these stashed on my boat, and it sees hard use. Highly recommended. RJB.",5,A terrific accessory for all kinds of things.,1274227200,"05 19, 2010",0.1478
4,AVXKXL0GFQHSL,B00007E8F3,W. Stump,"[1, 1]",For some reason this SAK is a real bargin. Basically a super tinker with the scale tool and about $7 cheaper. I doubt I'll ever use this for fishing but the scale tool will be handy as a &#34;pokey-type&#34; tool. I'll probably use mine to dig snow out of my cross country boot where the binding attaches. Plus the little silver fish looks classy.,5,cheaper than super tinker,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",0.1699
5,A1YEPFLLH42OU1,B00007E8F3,Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia Yu-Jin Chia,"[1, 1]","I've been using Victorinox knives since I was a cub scout. The original one I have (a Camper) is actually still functional, it's just gotten so dinged up, washed up, and sharpened so many times that the blades are getting hard to open even when doused with WD40. This is one of the very few products I've seen that's just as good off the factory floor today as it was two decades ago.I got one of these for my tacklebox as it seems to have everything I'd need. I mainly wanted a blade and scissors and was thinking of another Classic SD, but decided I'd rather have a bigger one that'll fit in my hand. I don't know if I'll need the hook disgorger/descaler, but it's there. I do prefer the phillips screwdriver to the corkscrew, and I have another Vic in my car that has one of those anyway. The knife has the classic shiny red plastic handle, not the textured dark red one that some others have. I still like the classic handle, though that may just be nostalgia speaking. The tools are very sharp and well-made, as is to be expected.I was considering trying out one of the new Wenger SA Evolution knives this time, even though they're now owned by Victorinox. However, I noticed they're about 50% more expensive for the same tools. Stopped to think about it a bit and asked myself, is it really going to be 50% better? Not to bash Wenger- they make good pocket knives too- but I don't think anything CAN be that much better than a Vic. This is a great tool for the money and one that you definitely can depend upon.",5,Still as good as they were 20 years ago,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",0.2811
