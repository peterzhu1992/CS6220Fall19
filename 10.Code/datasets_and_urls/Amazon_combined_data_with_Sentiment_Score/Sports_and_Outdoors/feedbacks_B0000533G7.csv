The dropdown for all the different scents and sizes is quite a nightmare, but the hemp peppermint one is 5th from the bottom of the list.I've been using Dr. Bronner's soaps for many years now and love his products. Many people know this brand from the eccentric writing that covers the entire surface of the bottle, espousing the late rabbi-chemist's philosophy and spiritual views (on the unity of mankind: We're All-One, or none). It wraps around the label, some of it's written vertically, some in very tiny print. It's idiosyncratic to say the least and gives me something to read while I'm in the shower. He wasn't officially an ordained rabbi, M.D., or PhD, but I like his products all the same.But aside from that, it's just a fantastic soap and you can feel good about supporting a company that believes in doing right by the world. It's 100% natural, biodegradable, not tested on animals, supports Fair Trade, ingredients are certified organic, and the bottle is made from 100% post-consumer recycled plastic. It is type 1 PETE plastic, so it is accepted by municipal recycling collection. The bottle even encourages you to conserve by refilling from gallon jugs or drums at the store.The soap works into a very rich lather and smells very nice. It smells like peppermint candy and rinses off cleanly, without a filmy, slippery feeling many liquid soaps leave. I keep a bottle of it in my gym bag.I also use it to wash fruits and vegetables because I don't like to peel them before eating in order to retain all the nutrition and fiber. Nutrients are richest in the skin of many fruits and vegetables. The soap washes off completely and I feel safe doing this (whereas before, I was using Palmolive).

I can't fault the soap totally for this as it's a great soap if you use it in the container provided, but I did want the consumer to be aware in the event that you decide to switch it to a pump dispenser.Two days ago I did this and it sprayed directly in my eye. It had clogged the pump dispenser because the pumping action makes a glob build up. The pain was so intense I couldn't stop screaming and it dried out my eye horribly.

A cool shower with peppermint soap is delightful. Peppermint is not bad in the kitchen, but Citrus --an orangey scent, is better for washing hands in the kitchen as it leaves no odd perfumes on your hands when cooking.The soap is now made using hemp seed oil and is somehow a bit lighter and less viscous than the former olive oil base. However it clogs pump containers because it's truly SOAP and not detergent. This is why it won't dry your hands as badly but it also congeals thickly when a small drop is exposed to air and thus, you get a clog. I tried for a while to put it into handsoap pump containers but no go.

I'm not a huge fan of using this soap as a shampoo, as it's difficult to find a good conditioner to match it's rosy scent, however, it's really nice to use as a face and body wash. As a shampoo, it tends to dry out my hair a little too much, also. As a face and body wash, I haven't noticed any effects of drying out my skin, and the scent is not strong enough to overpower, but strong enough so that when I get out of the shower that I am lightly rose scented.

Turns out the soap did, too - it smells wonderful, AND it works really well - gets oily skin really clean and fresh, but doesn't dry your skin at all.I buy the liquid form now for lots of things, from general housecleaning to shower-gel. It really lathers up nicely in our hard water. (I don't use it for dish-washing, though, because it does seem to leave a dull film on glass.) But by far my favorite use for it is in the foaming hand-soap dispenser. Dilute it at one part Dr. Bronner to three parts water, to get a nice, rich lather. I keep it on the kitchen sink and honestly, I probably wash my hands a lot more often than I need to because the scent is so uplifting. (Referring to the lavender here - I've tried the other scents, and they're OK I guess, but I love the lavender most!)The store I normally get it from just stopped carrying it recently, so I bought some of that Mrs. Meyers Clean Day stuff instead, hoping it would be similar.

The last part of the review will cover soap as it relates to health and some non-traditional uses of liquid soap.A 16oz bottle of this stuff lasts me, my wife, and daughter 4months, maybe more.It's all natural. It's all organic. It's easier on the skin than sodium tallowate, the #1 ingredient in nearly all bar soaps, which is nothing more than animal fat that has had lye added to it to saponify it.Dr. Bronners uses saponified coconut and other plant sourced oils.Lye is used in all soap making. It is a strong acid that chemically binds to fat and permanently alters it's chemical composition, creating nitro glycerine etc.Soap in bar form requires more lye to chemically alter a greater percentage of the fats.Soap in liquid form uses less lye and leaves more oil in a natural state. Bio-diesel fuel is also made that way.If there is no fat left for the lye to bind to, the lye remains in the soap. That is more likely to occur in bar soap. Lye is very acidic. It burns your skin on contact actually and is extremely dangerous to handle.Sodium tallowate strips your skin of its natural oils. Dr. Bronner's soap washes away your old oils, and leaves its pure plant based oils and a pleasant scent depending on which one you choose. Dr. Bronner's does still use lye of course, but 100% of the lye is used in saponification and the soap remains in liquid form.You may have heard that your skin is your largest organ. You may also know that your skin is porous. This is why your skin can dry out, or why absorbing certain chemicals through the skin can be fatal. It is why you can get skin cancer etc. Your skin is a living part of your body. When you use a harsh chemical like sodium tallowate, your skin absorbs some of that. Dr. Bronner's soap can be used as mouth wash.I have used it as shampoo, but it will leave your hair a bit sticky feeling because of the oils. It leaves a slight residue when compared to other natural/organic shampoos.It is great as a natural deodorant and not much is needed, it is just as good as tom's of main and burts bees.You can't use it as dishwasher liquid or laundry detergent because it lathers too easily. It lathers much better than most natural/organic liquid soaps I have used.

For the latter, it does very well cleaning laundry. I had a worn down, not so great smelling pair of shorts that I washed with vinegar, but the stench was still present. When I bought Dr. Bronners, I did the same thing and the smell was gone, replaced with the peppermint scent of the soap, which is a welcome addition. :)As a toothpaste? It's definitely more of a function over fashion kinda thing. Has a very soapy quality to it, as one would expect. But hey, it cleans the mouth/teeth, and that's what's important. Just chew some gum or clean your palette with something else if it's unbearable. For me, it was fine--didn't bother me.For shampoo? Don't use a lot of it as it does dry the hair quickly. It doesn't last after you've washed your hair and dried it, but the hair will be hard to manage during the process.Overall, I'm not very sure if I'll be exclusively bringing this along with my traveling. I think it'd be necessary for washing my clothes, so I will have a couple travel sized bottle of this bad boy with me. ;D And it'll also be good for emergencies, when I don't have body wash, shampoo, tooth paste, or if I need it to clean something else.I hope my review has helped!

Especially with how hot this summer has been, the peppermint makes for a totally refreshing shower or quick hand/face cooling wash.**Safe for color treated hair since it doesn't have any sulfates which is what fades color. You do need to use conditioner though if you use this for shampoo.**Great for pets too. I checked with a couple of vets and all three agreed this was a very safe wash, especially since it contains no funky chemicals. And yes, whatever scent used fades pretty quickly, though a minty or lavender scented dog is much preferable to one that just rolled in a dead rabbit. Trust me on this one....**It is super concentrated. Since it can be diluted one part soap to 40 parts water, a bottle can last months. For heavier, dirtier jobs, I add a bit more soap. Best part? No filmy residue that makes me have to go back and rinse mop the floor several times. A really welcome change for me from most commercial and some natural products.**Works well in my HE washing machine since it's low sudsing.**I haven't used it for some of the other uses like tooth brushing, but I imagine it would work well for that, too.Yep, I am pretty pleased with this soap. It's hard to find a product nowadays that really does live up to it's promises. It may not work for everyone, but I really recommend getting the smallest bottle just to try it out.

I love being clean but hate what soaps, creams, and cleansers do to my skin. I have tried all kinds of storeboughts, naturals, homemades, hypo-allergenics, etc, and just gave up trying to find a product that left me feeling clean but didn't cause a list of reactive issues. For a few years I've been using moisture rich shampoos as body washes with results that are far from perfect, but tolerable.When I read about the natural oil base of Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Peppermint Soap I had to give it a try. I was blown away by the results. It lathered much more than I expected. The scent was wonderful. Although it was watery, it is definitely concentrated and required very little on the washcloth. I immediately realized I had to be careful on my face and sensitive middle areas, but a quick rinse stopped the tingling from turning to a burn. I've had none of the problems I get from anything I've tried in the past. And amazingly enough I always feel physically energized when I get out of the shower.The first time I used it I showered in our guest bathroom, a shower we use when we've been working outside. After drying I walked into our bedroom where my wife of 33 years was working. I told her I used the soap. She instinctively felt my skin and said Wow, I've never felt your skin feel like this. Wow. Everything else aside, that was all the endorsement I needed.Update: I've been using Dr. Bronner's Pure Castile Peppermint Soap for about two weeks now. I now have a bottle in all the showers in our home. For years I've had persistent dry patches of skin that take constant attention with skin lotions to soften and fade, and frankly I haven't been disciplined enough to make them go away. I have not used the lotions at all since starting with the soap and the dry patches are disappearing. Additionally, the arsenal of back scratchers I have around the house, at work, and in my truck are rarely used now. Now I'm the one saying wow.Another Update: Using for 6-8 weeks now. Still sold. BTW, this stuff works great in those foaming hand cleaner dispensers made by a very familiar hand cleaner company that starts with the letter D. Don't use a full squirt though or you'll be wasting water just trying to wash the soap off your hands. You only need as little as 1/10th to 1/5th a squirt so it lasts a LONG time in the container. I tested it with only 1/2 Dr. B's soap in the container and after two weeks I can barely tell any has been used.

How to use it efficiently is not obvious, let me share my experience, as a liveaboard sailor obsessed with the stuff.I dilute this 5:1 to use in reused foaming hand soap or dish soap dispensers. Instant lather. I can use 5:1 foam for dishes, hair, body, shaving, teeth brushing. If a foaming dispenser holds 8oz for 200 pumps and I use 20 pumps a shower, that's .13 oz of soap per shower. Thus I save money on soap which is more effective anyway.An easy way to measure your ratio is to use a pump for soap and a pump for water. i found MAS epoxy pumpsResin and Hardener Pump Setfit on the gallon jug, and others have had luck with gallon jug pumps and coffee flavoring pumps on amazon. This way you can count 1 squirt of soap, 5 squirts of water, easy.10:1 in a spray bottle can be used for cleaning floors, cooktops, stubborn boat deck stains, car washing. Breathing the spray is irritating.40:1 in a bucket will clean floors, swab decks, clean bilge.Gets bugs off bumper. Gets gelcoat white. Gets baked-on grease off pans. Gets red pepper stains off cutting board. Clears up acne. Diminishes blackheads. Replaces 409, simple green, shampoo, body wash.People are turned off that this soap is runny and hard to use, especially when diluted. Worse, if you don't dilute it enough it will leave a lot of glycerine in your hair, leaving a weird texture. Undiluted bronners will gum up a non-foaming pump. It's hard to work up a lather with watery soap, it won't stay on a scrubby or brush. A foaming dispenser solves ALL of these problems. Even the peppermint burn is softened. Only downside is that the pump head sometimes won't come up on its own. This doesn't bother me.I've stopped using 409, Simple Green, Dawn, Old Spice bodywash, dandruff shampoo, and even slowed down on toothpaste and mouthwash. Lavender tastes better than peppermint.A good companion product is a deodorant crystal likeThai Deodorant Stick 4.25 Ounces.
