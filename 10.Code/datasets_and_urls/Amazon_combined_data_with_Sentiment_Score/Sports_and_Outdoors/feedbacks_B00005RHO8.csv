0,AQJUBIWM5GPEZ,B00005RHO8,Bruce A. Bennett,"[2, 2]",We had these when we were kids although the foot design is different. This one should last longer than those of 55 years ago and might be safer to boot.,4,Christmas gift.,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",0.2107
1,AQJUB96Y7X59A,B00005RHO8,dart dartlady,"[1, 1]","This is the best Pogo on the block. All the kids take turns using it. The wide base makes it easier for them, and easier to store. It is also fairly easy to get going. I highly recommend this, even my clutzy 7 year old does great on this.",5,The whole neighborhood likes this.,1314230400,"08 25, 2011",0.4447
2,AIG9X6ORE88KU,B00005RHO8,Maintenance Mgr,"[2, 2]","When we take this to the park, then all these children want to play with it. Funny, but it actually gets annoying, because as a parent, I have to hold other people's kids to keep them safe while they are jumping up and down. PLUS, my kids don't get to use it as much because of the other children. There is a weight limit on this pogo stick, so be careful with heavier children. Other than that, it's easy to use, and even to store. Barely takes up any space and even stands on it own with the base. Make sure that you stay with your child until he/she gets really good with it.",5,Great toy,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",0.2915
3,A2HDP6VU3PLJ81,B00005RHO8,Northern Gal,"[2, 2]","I bought this for my 4 year old niece. I haven't heard any complaints from my sister about it so I'm assuming it has worked out great! She will be able to grow with it, obviously, so that was one of the main reasons I bought it.",4,No complaints,1374019200,"07 17, 2013",0.2561
4,A1ATLJGEASTPRC,B00005RHO8,Puerto Rico,"[1, 1]","My 5 yr old daughter got this for Christmas. It is very challenging for her to use, but she keeps trying to master it, so I guess it is still fun even if it is hard for her. She is small and light for her age, so I expect she'll get plenty of use out of it. My son who is 8 has tried it a few times too and finds it challenging as well. It's good exercise!",4,Fun and a challenge,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",0.3085
5,A1WN53IBOPFZLL,B00005RHO8,Robert,"[3, 3]",The kids really love this pogo stick. One will get on the others shoulders and the other on the handles and jump and do flips on the trampoline. Pretty cool to watch.,5,Boy loves it.,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",0.4467
6,A1CS6G9G4Q1ATF,B00005RHO8,Verjeep,"[1, 1]",My twin 7 year old hyperactive boys love this thing - they have spent countless hours in the last few weeks hopping on it. We have only used it with the larger base but they are getting good enough at it that I think I might be trying to remove it in the next few weeks. The amount of energy my boys can burn on this is awesome. It seems very sturdy and it has not had any problems putting up with the abuse doled out to it.,5,great exercise for kids,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",0.3791
