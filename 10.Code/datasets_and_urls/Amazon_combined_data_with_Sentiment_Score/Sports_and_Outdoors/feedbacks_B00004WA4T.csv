1,A3S5MDHBCCGO48,B00004WA4T,Chew Her BladesRock!!,"[0, 0]","I bought this knife a while back and have used it for a few years now. It is one of my blades that tasted my flesh. I cut myself opening a back of Gatorade. This knife has done some carving, fishing, gutting, food prepping, etc. It is a neat little folder I use at home and outdoors. The only recommendation I'd make would be to have the sheath velcro be replaced with a button. Then I would feel better about carrying the knife on my belt. Just saying if Gerber is listening. This blade design just works. Never slips when wet. And I love how it just feels in my hands.",5,I love this knife,1375401600,"08 2, 2013",0.1148

3,A2YYKWEKAAL2GB,B00004WA4T,David M. Hall,"[0, 0]","My wife uses this as her camping kitchen knife. She, however, doesn't like to carry it, finding it too heavy for wearing in her hiking shorts. It does not have a pocket clip, but comes with a belt sheath. This should have been my first warning it was too heavy for her pocket. Oh well, still a great addition to our gear.The unserrated blade is easy to sharpen and holds an edge well and the locking mechanism is strong and positive. The grip truly is all weather as claimed. It has an excellent texture, which combined with its rubbery construction gives one a great grip even when wet.",4,Simple and effective.

7,A213MNNCABU95F,B00004WA4T,thassler,"[18, 18]","Gerber (A Fiskars Company) put out some of the best knives for the money in the market. Fiskars is my favorite scissors company and everything I've used of their stuff is top notch - so this is a good combo.I have this knife in the partially serrated version. It is 8.75 long when open, 5 when closed, and the blade is 3.75. If you have the serrated model, the first 1.5 is serrated. The remaining smooth blade hones nicely and stays sharp. Gerber 650 &Portland;, OR U.S.A are printed on either side of the blade.The grip is exceptional. The Kraton handle is very tough and offers superior traction and grip with it's rubbery feeling alligator finish. It has a notch for the index finger and the butt curves down to fit your other fingers very comfortably. It feels like a part of your hand when you hold it and is balanced nicely for a folder. It simply stays in your hand when you want it there.The lock is solid with a lever-lock cog/pin system in the backside. The cordura/nylon belt sheath has a velcro closure that has some adjustability to it. Mine is several years old now and I still love this knife. For this price, it's an amazing buy. There are knives that cost 3 or 4 times as much that don't feel nearly as good. The steel could be a little harder, but it holds its edge admirably.They came out with this over a decade ago and you can still find it and it's popular. I think that says a lot. I haven't used the ones with the hook point (sinew cutter for hunting, cutting rope etc.) but they seem virtually identical.The only thing this knife is missing is an ambidextrous notch for quick opening. I give it 4.5 stars, rounding up for price/performance ratio and fantastic quality and grip.",5,Absolutely stellar belt knife.,1133913600,"12 7, 2005",0.3534
8,A35WYJH6MPPIFV,B00004WA4T,turf,"[2, 2]","I have a pretty decent knife collection and love Benchmade and Spyderco knives which I use for various purposes and when I carry a largish knife in my pocket, it is usually an old style Griptilian since it is light. But I always have the Gator in my backpack or pocket when I am in the woods. I don't even remember how old it is - at least 10 years. It gets more rugged use than any other since it is functional, strong, easy to sharpen, comfortable, and inexpensive. I am not afraid to use it as a tiny machete or pound a rock on it to cut through a branch or small tree or even make a spear. And the handle is comfortable enough for tedious jobs and whittling. I much prefer the Gator's back lock to liner locks, which most other knives in this range have. If you keep it oiled and cleaned, and practice, you can sling out the blade in a fraction of a second as well as easily close and stow it with one hand. If I could only have one knife, it would be a hard choice between this one and the Griptilian. If I could have one knife that cost less than a hundred bucks, it would be the Gator. And it's way less than that!",5,Best large knife for the money,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",0.2344
