1,A2BZVE4BIWPFK6,B00004T1JW,Diver Dave,"[5, 5]","Nice heavy duty base set. Couldn't believe they were as well made as they are. I was expecting something a bit cheeper, but was pleased when they arrived. The kids love them!",5,great,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",0.4892
2,AN237S5G9GPXC,B00004T1JW,eric cunningham,"[2, 2]","We've only had these for 6 practices and one game. They've been holding up great with all those little cleats running over them. I like that they are thicker & heavier than other brands I considered. However, I wouldn't use metal cleats on a rubber product. Really, for the same price there are many products which are inferior as far as thickness & durability go. Also, the &#34;tread&#34; on the bottom helps keep the bases in place. Obviously, if the grass is wet or the dirt is dry, they're going to slip...these aren't designed to compare to a secured base. Don't have unrealistic expectations. Still, I'm loving our set & think it should make it through the season. They fit in one of my baseball gear bags, but then it becomes too heavy & no room for helmets or catcher's gear. Got a collapsable wagon for the bases, tee, net, & gear bag. Some have complained about not having a pitchers mound. It'd be a nice inclusion, but for tee ball, we don't need it. Besides, temporary mound rubber would only mark distance, not give a push off point. I'd like one, but it doesn't seem real necessary for the price.",5,Rubber bases,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",0.093
3,AH0C5DIY7MGE3,B00004T1JW,jmmmj jmmmj,"[5, 5]","These are a great buy - very weighted down so they don't slide too easily but light enough for kids to easily transport themselves. These are our favorite bases, I highly recommend them.",5,"WOW, great bases",1363046400,"03 12, 2013",0.6643
4,A18AZU25XB39FB,B00004T1JW,Kennon A. Mccaa,"[0, 0]","I use these with a team of 13 little leaguers that are 7-8 years old. We use these before every game and every practice and the boys run around them 4 times per event. So, that's about 50 touches per event. We've had about 30 practices and games so that's about 1500 touches so far. They're getting real dirty but they aren't breaking and I'm very pleased with them. They're quite heavy but that's necessary to make them last. I am very happy with them. They make a great warm-up station. Have your kids run around them and practice their base rounding technique, checking for signs from the 3B coach as they run, etc... I like being able to set them at a shorter distance so we don't tire the kids. We're just warming up. After two round trips we do a full round trip doing shuffle steps and then we finish w/ a &#34;4 step combo&#34; which is a run to first, shuffle to 2B, back pedal to 3B and criss-cross to home. It is far better than running out and touching the outfield fence.",5,Durable,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",0.2083
5,AQ2VQSRYLJVZP,B00004T1JW,Lee Collison,"[0, 0]","We use these all the time for travel and rec baseball. I've used them indoors and at the park for practices, these are a must have as they are heavy solid construction. Buy these over any of the light weight $20 base sets.",5,Great waffle bases,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",0.051
6,A102J5JG330YPA,B00004T1JW,N. Terry,"[2, 2]","These bases are very nice for the price, even if they were cost a little more.They are very thick rubber, with a waffle design on the bottom. i coach my sons baseball team, and these have held up very well for 2 seasons of practices. These are MUCH nicer than the thinner version of these bases, which tear after a couple practices with kids running on them with cleates.",5,Very nice set of bases,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",0.4181
7,A1EF3T7CW70BKE,B00004T1JW,Redogg Redogg,"[3, 3]",I've used this for a few weeks with my T-Ball team. The bases have held up really well. They seem to be constructed of durable material and should last a long time as long as you're not using metal spikes.,5,Good Product,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",0.1128
8,A5NA8I02DWUXE,B00004T1JW,Robert E. Keto moesgrill,"[0, 0]",I purchased this for my son to practice with in the back yard. The bases are well made and will easily hold up over time.,4,Solid performer for the backyard baseball game.,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",0.2712
9,A3AEKP7DKBH6VD,B00004T1JW,S. Porcher seannslo,"[1, 1]","These are very nice quality rubber bases. They are much much nicer than the simple plastic throw bases and will last you a long time. They are perfect for a trip to the park, t-ball, baseball etc. The only reason I did not give them five stars is that the box is very thin and cannot be used as a permanent storage. The box lasted like two weeks - and then I had to find another suitable way to lug them around (keep in mind - they are solid - so they aren't light). It would be nice if they would include a nylon carry bag or something with a handle that could be used to permanently store, haul, carry these around. Otherwise - they are very useful!",4,These are nice quality rubber bases,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",0.418
