0,A2TEEBSEEYG98Q,B000030056,bwebs13,"[0, 0]","I was thinking of buying a pool float to use as my camping mat and I found a great deal. $10 for an air mattress SOLD! Luckily for me I have an air pump with me when i go canoe camping because my canoe is inflatable. If I didn't i would Not get this, as it is VERY hard to inflate. Because I have a foot pump it takes me 5-10 minutes to pump this up and for $10 it works for me.If you have a pump then this will do for your camping or pool needs. If you don't then I would not get it as it is VERY hard to inflate.Others said its also hard to deflate, i found if you cut/puncture the inner seal and just let it deflate on its own its fine.",5,Excellent Cheap Camping Air Mat,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",0.089
1,AJGU56YG8G1DQ,B000030056,E. Kennedy,"[0, 0]",This is a great pool float. Floats very well. It's big enough for an adult to use comfortably. It folds up a lot easier when deflated then others too. Great for taking with you!,5,Good Pool Float!,1309132800,"06 27, 2011",0.493
2,A25HVIAOHLFQ6M,B000030056,Gadget Man Dum Vivimus Vivamus,"[3, 3]",Cheap product! Within two days of use it started to loose air where I found a pin size hole and is now no longer useable. You could buy the same product (also made in china) at local stores for 1/4 the price. I would not recommend this product.,1,Cheap product,1309564800,"07 2, 2011",-0.2045
3,A3M9P66YDEKWLO,B000030056,Gregory Delany,"[0, 0]","These pool floats are the best design by far. Wide enough that it's easy to climb off and on in the deepest water, extremely stable in operation. All around a great product. Unfortunately, like all of these plastic floats they eventually spring a leak and are very difficult to repair. The provided repair kits are practically useless. But great while it lasts.",5,Excellent pool float,1337990400,"05 26, 2012",0.274
4,AC61U16AJQ8X7,B000030056,Home Owner Amazon Man,"[0, 0]",Bought 3 of these for the pool and they are very well made and best part is WIDE. You should have an inflater though to fill these. Love the way they roll up even when inflated unlike others that are stiff. They are thin but this allows water to enter the top of raft for cooling and roll up for storage without deflating.,5,Best pool raft for the money.,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",0.4244
5,A217UXXG9OTM1Z,B000030056,jbrianb,"[23, 24]","I camp out a lot and needed something lightweight and portable and not nearly as thick and heavy as an air mattress, but more comfortable on an aging back than a self-inflater or a foam pad.It's not terribly easy to inflate or deflate based on the way the cells link together, but comfort is outstanding and width is greater than with a pint sized mat (29 vs. 20 inches, and that nine inches makes a great difference). I wish it was sold AS an outdoor mattress and had a quick release valve, but it's a small price to pay for light weight, portability and comfort. If it were sold as an outdoor mat, I suspect color variations and a quick release would make their way onto the product. After all, neon pink raises some eyebrows as it rides with my bed kit on the back of my kayak, but for the comfort, it can't be beaten. Maybe the next one will end up being blue when it comes in...",5,A different use for a terrific product,1297296000,"02 10, 2011",0.3927
6,A7JC62FV0BRHE,B000030056,PapaRox PapaRox,"[3, 4]","Most sleeping bag pads are either paper thin foam OR big bulky blow up mattresses OR very expensive auto blowup thin padsTHESE 2 inch thick mattresses blow up reasonably stiff, are not huge bulky things are cheap and very comfortable and are quite large for their bulk. Much larger than any sleeping bag. I was amazed at how well they supported my 6ft 250lb frame. and the pillow is an added bonus.EXCELLENT value in sleeping bag pads",4,I got for sleeping bag padding and for that purpose these are excellent,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",0.3733

8,AW802ECRRLOSK,B000030056,TBKHomeworld,"[0, 0]",This float was purchased to be a 'floating cover' as required by central Texas laws in regards to having 25% of your pool covered. This float does not stay in the pool on even mildly windy days so I do not recommend it for that purpose. Additionally I got the orange one which faded within the first week and now after a few more weeks looks absolutely pitiful.I have to put air into it every couple of weeks too.The kids do enjoy this one a lot because it allows their body's to dip into the water while relaxing on it.,3,Meh,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",0.1584
