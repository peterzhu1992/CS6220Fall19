0,A168UTC2EFSGQL,B00005RCQS,Anon,"[5, 5]",I purchased this mat a few months ago from Amazon.com since I can no longer find it at any sports supply stores. This mat is just like the ones we used to have in our grammar school gymnasiums. I purchased it so that I can tote it around and use it at home. It is easy to use since it folds out evenly without bumpy areas and stores well since it folds in half. The mat is just the right thickness for comfort and I find that it supports me when I need to do exercises while lying on the floor. I can no longer lie on a plain carpeted surface without extra cushioning from a mat. The price is very reasonable as well. If you are looking for a simple but comfortable floor mat for doing exercises and stretching I recommend this mat. Note: when you get the mat out of the box you may notice a plastic-type smell from being in storage. This will dissipate over time and does not affect the quality of the mat.,5,Wonderful for Indoor Exercise,1367452800,"05 2, 2013",0.1694
1,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B00005RCQS,Armando N. Roman,"[2, 2]","This year I'm determined to get back into better fighting shape, and in doing so, I'm buying a lot of equipment that my old martial arts school had. We had Everlast mats all over the place, though they folded into three sections instead of two like this one. Still, it's the exact same mat aside from that aspect, and I'm glad Everlast continues to put out quality equipment.My home has hardwood floors, and I was previously using a thin rug from a certain Swedish furniture store to do basic exercises on, like stretching, leg lifts, situps and push ups. It got the job done, but wasn't that comfortable. This mat has the right padding and thickness that I needed, giving my body full support for everything I do on it. If it wasn't comfortable, I'd say so. This is an excellent mat for anyone who might not have a very big area in their home for whatever exercise they might need this for. Pilates, tumbling, gymnastics, martial arts, throwing, yoga...there's a lot this small mat can be used for. It's easy to clean up any marks, and storage is simple since it can be folded in half and tucked away in a closet or under the bed when it's not being used. The handles are sturdy, and unless you -try- to rip them off, they won't be falling off any time soon.It's funny how when I read that this mat was 'only' 1 5/8 thick, I was worried that it might not be enough. But as soon as I took it out of the shipping box, I knew it was perfect. This is a fantastic mat and I plan on buying more in the future. Hopefully a bigger version is released sometime. For the price this one sells for, you're getting an excellent deal, and I'd gladly pay two or three times as much for one two or three times as big!",5,An excellent mat for those who need some space.,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",0.3683
2,AUBKXJYRKGOF4,B00005RCQS,A. Young,"[0, 0]","This is a wonderfully well-made mat. The stitching is solid and the mat material feels very durable and high-quality, as is usually the case with Everlast items. The 1 5/8 thickness also makes the mat very comfortable and shock-absorbent -- I imagine it'd be great for tumbling and/or doing any kind of ab workout where you sit a lot.However, I originally bought this mat for Insanity, and I found two drawbacks with it for that program: (1) The thickness of the mat makes it a bit unstable for quick lateral movements and floor holds, which are HUGE parts of the Insanity workouts. (2) The smooth material gets very slick with sweat, which makes it a bit treacherous (at one point I slipped over sideways doing a 1-2-3 Heisman... but at least the thickness of the mat padded my fall!). I was also using this mat on top of a carpet and found that it tended to slide around, though I think it'd stay in place better on wood.In short: The mat itself is great quality, but it's probably best suited to certain kinds of workouts. (I eventually wound up getting an oversized yoga mat for Insanity because it has better traction and is a bit more stable for sideways movements and push-ups/planks.)",4,"High-quality mat, though best for certain kinds of exercise",1380499200,"09 30, 2013",0.3435

The mat is well constructed and very thick-- I am quite comfortable in all my stretch positions. I do not stress the mat much, so I cannot speak to its ability to handle abuse, however, it seems very sturdy and the handle straps are sewn quite securely. If you need to transport your mat, I would think it might be nice to have some elastic loops or something to keep the mat closed-- I don't move mine so that is not a concern for me.",5,Very comfortable,1329696000,"02 20, 2012",0.5038
6,A34P05CNGFTWJG,B00005RCQS,handyman49,"[5, 5]",I have been sleeping on this mat for several years and I love it. It is very firm but I like it that way. When I visit people I bring it along and lay it on the floor for sleeping. When I first got it the plastic mat cover had a plastic odor for awhile but that went away after a few weeks. In hot weather I wrap a sheet around the mat so it doesn't stick to me and I can roll over easier.,5,good firm sleeping mat,1278115200,"07 3, 2010",0.3121

14,A20713QKOYN8X2,B00005RCQS,MidnightRunner,"[1, 1]","I gotta say that I felt like I was rolling the dice on this, because I was not sure if it would be firm enough. It is soft, but also firm, but not as firm as the commercial type blue mats used for things like gymnastics. Really that is OK though since for a exercise and stretching mat it does not need to be that firm, and this mat is a good balance. I think the quality is OK and there was only the faintest of odor up close which is not a minus, just an observation. The size is also good, I doubt many people would need something bigger.",4,Very nice mat,1343347200,"07 27, 2012",0.3832

The thickness is plenty good enough to protect me from the hard floor, yet supportive enough for my back. The vinyl is very easy to wipe clean. One of the best things I like about this mat is the fact it folds in half and has neat carry handles. I have a small home gym so just pull it out when I need it then wipe down and fold it up and prop it up against a wall when it's not in use. The color is great too. Compared to the much thinner mats I was using when I had gym membership, I think this is an excellent purchase.

These look the same but they aren't solid like the old ones. They are better than some of the cheaper versions but again, NOT worth the price. If you expect to get a good sturdy mat like Everlast used to make, this mat is NOT it! I guess they just don't make them like the older version. The original Everlast mats weren't made of sponge. Don't know what they were made of but they're much better than these and yes, my ORIGINAL mats are still going strong. I'm not sure these will last very long at all.You can see in the picture how the vinyl looks wrinkled.
