I cut my thumb on the blade! Old EMT trainng came into effect ... hehe. I will comment later when I use it more. I bought this to see how will the saw blades will work for carving/sawing wooden triggers for snares and dead falls. Not sure this device will be up to it.It's slick and easy to keep clean. The pouch is nice and I wear it when I go out of the house I do have confidence it will come in handy for several years.UPDATE:After 3 months I bought another as my son wanted a version of a Leatherman ... so I bought him this one. Be careful ... I cut myself again!",5,Sharp!,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",0.0717

But unlike the rescue tool, this was a pain to get the individual tools out. They are too tucked into the frame and you have to pry them out with something to get at one, and then get at the others. I don't know if it was a defect or if the are all like this, but it was not like their other product that I own.",3,Quality is great but..,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",0.0789
2,A2SCG962SND0ST,B00004YVB0,circle_of_iron,"[0, 0]","This is an amazing multi-tool and I give it a strong recommendation. The action on all the tools is smooth and feels solid. Everything locks into place nice and tight.I have recommended SwissTools to the guys at work and several have picked them up, everyone loves them.One side note, although I recommend this (and Victorinox other multi-tools) without reservation, I do feel that I have to mention that I purchased one of these tools from Amazon and the one that came to me was clearly refurbished. The bolts that it swivels on where clearly (and poorly I might add) restamped and there was serious marring along the side of the tool. I ended up returning the one I purchased from Amazon, getting my money back and purchasing from another vendor (on another web site). Additionally, this is not the first multi-tool I have purchased from Amazon that I felt was a refurbished/floor model. I also bought a Leatherman, that I also returned.I recommend this tool with no reservations, but I would encourage you to purchase from elsewhere.",5,Great Tool,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",0.464
3,A2XD2SRQ77OGXV,B00004YVB0,David S. Markowitz,"[1, 1]","I've had a couple of Gerber Multipliers that have served me well but kept reading how good the Swisstools are, so I ordered one from Amazon last week. My initial impression is, WOW! The Swisstool is really well made and finished. It feels considerably more solid than the Gerbers I have, or the Leatherman tools I've handled. I shouldn't be too surprised, since I have four other Victorinox Swiss Army Knives: a Cybertool 41, and three Pioneers, one of which I've gone back to my everyday carry knife, having bought it in the early 1980s. (I keep one Pioneer in my truck and my wife's car for emergencies.)Except for the pliers, the individual tools can be accessed without opening the tool. Each tool locks in place, so you don't have to be concerned with them closing on your fingers. The handle is contoured so that it doesn't dig into your hand when you squeeze down on the pliers. The knife blade, belt cutter, and reamer are very sharp. The seat belt cutter is a serrated, curved blade with a round point. The cutting edge is on the inside of the curve. I could this being useful on boats when you need to cut something but don't want to risk using a pointy knife. The scissors are slightly larger than those on my Cybertool 41, with which I've cut a fair amount of CAT5. The scissors are nice and sharp.A well-constructed black nylon belt sheath with a snap closure was included. The sheath is designed to stay open so that you can easily re-sheath the multitool with one hand.So far, I've used the bottle opener, to open a bottle of Yuengling Lager. Works great. :-) I also tested the scissors on some heavy corrugated cardboard and they worked well. Both the knife blades are very sharp and cut well.If you're in the market for a good multitool, the Swisstools from Victorinox are definitely worth looking at.",5,An outstanding multitool,1182211200,"06 19, 2007",0.2769
4,A2PKP40YA4UIAO,B00004YVB0,Gunslinger,"[0, 1]",I have several multi-tools. I use one or another on a daily basis. But this one makes them all pale in comparison. Its heavy and all the blades are razor sharp. Mine came with a lite coat of oil from the manufacture so it was good to go out of the box. It was a bit tight but after use it loosened a bit,5,Great looking and functioning tool,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",0.0813
5,A2SPWZH2KSOI4D,B00004YVB0,H. A.,"[1, 1]","I've wanted one of these tools for a long time and I finally decided to go for it. I've handled the SwissTool as well as multi tools by Leatherman and SOG, which are brands I highly respect. I decided for the SwissTool because it feels more like a real tool than the others. It is simply more substantial, appears to be sturdier. The tools locking open is also a great feature and that alone had a lot to do with my choice. You can't go wrong with any of the 3 name brands but if you need durability the choice is easier.Note: the tool comes with a sheath. So unless you dislike nylon, you don't need to order the sheath separately.",5,Great tool. Keep in mind it comes with a sheath (nylon).,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",0.2287
6,A3A86X1YU2JE8S,B00004YVB0,Heidrich,"[0, 0]","What I like:Aesthetically pleasing to look at, handle and use. The stainless steel is very appealing, and holds a nice shine. The tools opening and locking have a very substantial, visceral click. The curve of the plyer handles are very comfortable.It comes with a very nice, light-weight nylon SNAP pouch (I hate the velcro ones).It's lighter in weight than a Leatherman Surge, which is what I carried for the past ten years.What I dislike:Nothing. I'm willing to sacrifice one-handed blade deployment for what I consider an aesthetically superior MT.",5,The Aesthetic Multi-tool,1370995200,"06 12, 2013",0.3215
7,A1DFAMAESAPX94,B00004YVB0,Hubie,"[0, 0]",I use it almost constantly at work and I love this thing. It has come in handy so many times since I got it. Very durable and works good! Awesome Victorinox!,5,Love this product!,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",0.4471
8,AEE42UT3ERITN,B00004YVB0,J. Nowicki The Boss and Mrs. B.,"[16, 17]","The Victorinox Swiss Tool RS is just what I was looking for - a mini tool set. I can't wait to try them all out. This is one of those 'don't leave home without it' items and comes in handy when I go hunting and fishing. While, you can't carry every tool with you to handle each and every unforseen emergency situation, this Victorinox comes as close as any to being able to do just that. It's a little too big to keep in my pocket but since it comes with a sturdy case it works fine on my belt.My Marine Corps experiences from the cold of Norway to the steaming jungles of Panama tells me this is a winner. Just like myVictorinox Swiss Army Explorer with Free Pouch, this is truly a quality product, one that you can count on to get the job done. You will definitely be glad you ordered it.

9,A2S7CSBDWOLPRQ,B00004YVB0,Mike,"[0, 0]","Good tool. Very comparable to the some of the Leatherman mid size to large tools. I think this tool is more geared to an office setting whereas the Leatherman is more for hard outdoor use. Nevertheless, this is a strong well built tool that will last a long time. Definitely worth buying if you need a multi tool for work in an office setting.",5,Victorinox RS tool,1360022400,"02 5, 2013",0.297
10,A2PML45NRZ7FLP,B00004YVB0,Phxdog,"[0, 0]","This has been an EDC since the purchase. Though it's a heavy tool, the cordura sheath is sturdy, quiet and out of the way on my belt at a 5 o'clock carry position. The Victorinox logo on the pouch makes it much more acceptable for wear at the office than my Gerber or Leatherman; must be a subliminal 'peaceful, neutral Switzerland' kind of thing!Fit and finish are amazing; much better than the Gerber and Leatherman I own. Pliers are strong & close tightly. Too soon to rate the strength of the steel.I did not buy the Plus model (Bits, Cork Screw/Micro Screwdriver). I opted to purchase a quality micro (eyeglass) screwdriver separately. It lives securely in the bottom of the standard pouch. If I ever find I need those extra bits and wrench, I can customize to my needs cheaper than what these extras cost.I would recommend the RS to a friend and that they buy it from Amazon. It came 2 days after I placed my order!",5,SwissTool RS - Heavy Workhorse,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",0.3484
11,A2HMG925YHACE2,B00004YVB0,Ronald Franklin,"[1, 1]","I own several brands of Multi-tools, SOG, Gerber, Leatherman and now Victorinox. Nothing against the other brands, they are each very good in their own right, but this tool is nothing less than the Swiss perfection that you would expect from Victorinox. The pliers are very smooth and not stiff like the other brands (with exception to the spring assisted Gerber EVO or Butterfly). And the accessories are the easiest of all brands to open, they work just as smooth as opening up any Victorinox knife, and I might add they are also just as sharp. The only thing that could make this better is the opening of the pliers; I have yet to find any multi-tool that opens as smooth and as easy as the gear driven SOG PowerLock. Just my $0.02.....!!! I highly recommend the RS and would definitely buy this one again.",5,Swiss Perfection,1232668800,"01 23, 2009",0.3365
12,AAVKU4DFGY3MI,B00004YVB0,Sam Adams,"[1, 1]","This is my first and only multi-tool. It is exceptionally well built, rock solid, and has the tools I want. I have not compared it to other brands or to other models by Victorinox, but cannot imagine how any other multi-tool tool could be better made.",5,SwissTool RS,1191196800,"10 1, 2007",0.3674
13,A1QV6WSWL96DA6,B00004YVB0,T. Granillo Pitch Black Midnight,"[0, 0]",I had been wanting a multitool with a good set of pliers for a long time now. But with all the choices on the market and most of them being less than cheap I didn't know what to do. Then I saw Victorinox made multitools and they had really good ratings. As soon as I saw the Swiss Army brand I was sold. If you're looking for a solidly built multi tool this is a great choice. I like how all the tools lock into place and I think the pliers are a good size and shape to handle a variety of uses.,5,Awesome,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",0.3696
14,A3GRPJYWL6C7OF,B00004YVB0,The Amazonian,"[0, 1]","I really like this MT and give it 4 stars, and the reason it is not 5 stars is because I noticed that although the multi tools lock in place and work very well, its moves slightly when I wiggle it with my fingers. Compared to my leatherman Charge TTi, the charge TTi tools lock and do not move %100. The swisstool RS locks but does not move %98. OVerall even though it moves very slightly if I wiggle it with my fingers, It does not hinder performance. I like the fit and finish, the polish i believe withstands rust better than the leatherman, but I have not yet to see either rust.I do not like the pouch it comes with, when I got it i noticed a lot of tiny fine hairs shedding inside it and it got stuck in between the multi tools so I had to clean it off and wipe it down with some rubbing alchohol, I do not like that the fine threading sheds because I do not want to ingest or inhale it by accident and could be a potential health hazard. Also I do not like how the tools are a bit tough to pick out with your fingernail but I have healthy strong nails so I have practiced getting them out, but I am sure it can hurt your nails for most people. I believe the tools get easier to pick out with your fingernail over time as you use it more. Not a deal breaker though I still like this tool a lot.Overall this is a high quality product that I like and i am happy I bought it.",4,"I like it, but could be better.",1329436800,"02 17, 2012",0.2912
