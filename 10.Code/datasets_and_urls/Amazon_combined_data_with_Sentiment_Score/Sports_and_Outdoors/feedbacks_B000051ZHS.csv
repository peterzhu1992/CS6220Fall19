0,A3QEDG5QQW2CVP,B000051ZHS,1234,"[2, 3]",I bought these boats to float around in the lake while my wife snorkels. I tie them together so one is my pack mule boat and one is for me. They work great. I'm over 6'2 and 210lbs and I haven't popped one yet.,4,Cheap and Solid,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",0.1562
1,A284ICLE430ZUL,B000051ZHS,Alex,"[2, 3]","I took this on it's first trip this weekend. We hiked to a isolated lake inside of an island in Michigan. This was about a 5 mile hike. The boat is pretty lightweight, I had no issue rolling and strapping it to my backpack. The pump took a good amount of time to get the raft nice and inflated, but it held air for the remainder of the trip.I fished out of the raft for 4 days. I constantly had hooks rubbing against the rubber and never once did it puncture. I was pretty rough against the paddle-holders and they held up nicely. The boat moved through the water rather well for an inflatable raft, no complaints there.This is good for one grown adult and maybe a child. This fit myself and my fishing gear pretty comfortably. We used the explorer 300 for two adults, and that worked well.",5,"Lightweight, Durable, Functional - A Backpacker's Review",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",0.292

3,A10LB6S2BXQ0GD,B000051ZHS,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I bought this for a float down a river and this was perfect. It stayed inflated, the oars worked well and didn't fall out during use, and it was pretty comfy. I've only used it once so I can't say anything about longevity.",5,Perfect for river float,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",0.4068
4,A2345IMLMM85UA,B000051ZHS,AZ INLO,"[2, 3]","This little boat was a good price and came with the oars (they are expensive if you purchase alone). I got this boat and the oars for only $4-5 more than just the oars, so we were happy, we now have two little boats (and yes, one set of oars). Great for a pool or paddling around in water close to shore. I wouldn't send it out in the water too far - no idea how it would hold up, but we've had ours for a year and it's still holding original air, so that boasts well for the quality.",5,"nice little boat, worth the money",1368662400,"05 16, 2013",0.5653
5,A3KT5SEGWNGRWZ,B000051ZHS,David,"[0, 0]",Small but it fit me 5'8&#34; 210 lbs and my 3 year old. Took it out on the lake and it held up great. Came with 2 surprisingly decent paddles and a pump. I definitely got my money's worth out of it and will absolutely buy it again.,5,Love these!,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",0.4951
6,A1SRDHXNBJRUWB,B000051ZHS,Dylan Murphy,"[0, 0]","This thing is amazing! I go on river floats basically every other weekend in the summer and this is used as the beer barge where we keep our shoes, coolers, keys etc. Not only does it admirably hold all the weight loaded into it, it has so far remained completely damaged even though people repeatedly throw crushed beer cans and bottle caps in it. I've only used it a couple times as a person floater but it had ample space for me (6'2&#34; -185lbs) and I didn't feel like it was going to sink. I've also not used the oars yet. If I were going to make this purchase again, I probably would look at getting something that could hold two people for me and a friend to go play around in the creeks etc but I'm not sure that they make anything as cheap as I want that does all that. I highly recommend this boat and the full Intex line to anyone looking for river float craft.",5,What a trooper!,1357776000,"01 10, 2013",0.0705

Pump and oars included in the box, all worked fine. Anticipate lots of fun playing in the shallows with my kids this summer, a great bargain at 20 bucks.",5,Looks Good,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",0.5059

Neighbours have been floating down the creek for 3 years in one, just got their first leak this summer.If something happens to it, no big deal. To patch a hole, duct tape or tuck tape will work fine if you don't have a real patch.",5,For what it is and price you can't beat it,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",-0.1184
9,A1NVZNIM4F2LIW,B000051ZHS,J. Young,"[0, 1]","This boat is for pool use only. It did not hold up during a 4 hour, 4 mile kayak trip with minimal rapids.Early in the trip the boat rubbed on some rocks underwater and the floor of the boat was punctured and started taking on water. By the end of the trip the boat got caught on a rock while I was towing it and it ripped the plastic ring off the front where you can tie a rope.It deflated almost instantly and sank our stereo with my mp3 player before we got a chance to save our stuff.So I can say first hand this boat isn't durable enough to be anything other than a pool toy. However, if you played too rough with it then you could probably tear it up in the pool too.",3,It is a pool toy and that's about it.,1349654400,"10 8, 2012",0.2882

11,AJ7VVCALVT8KP,B000051ZHS,MLONG,"[0, 0]",Arrived fast. I blew it up to check for holes since we don't plan on using it until this summer. The oars were fairly easy to assemble. The pump is cheap and fell apart easily but we have a nicer one that we use anyway. The kids loved playing in the boat once it was blown up (even if only in the living room). I can't wait to take this to the lake this summer. It's going to be a huge hit with the kids. Deflated easily for storage.,5,nice boat for kids,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",0.3081
12,ALTJKER8IKZAM,B000051ZHS,Mr.DNYC,"[0, 0]",This thing was a trooper! took it on a tubing trip down 3 different rivers lazy and rough. the oars were great it comes with a hand pump works great till i slid down a dam with do rough rocks and bottom tore but still stayed up above water great buy for cost just dont drag it on floor or scrape on rough rocks. but it was loads of fun and held up and im 350lbs and a case of beer!,4,Fun and tough!,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",0.316

14,A1GDGX206VQVP4,B000051ZHS,oibv305,"[0, 0]","I bought this boat for my grandson to use at the beach. The ocean was rough, but my granddaughter and two of her cousins rode in the boat at the same time and had an absolute blast riding breakers in to the beach. The bottom inflates separately, so don't forget to inflate it as well. The only thing I really did not like is the inflation valve. It is one of those valves that comes on any cheap float or tube you buy at the beach. The Intex River Run tube I bought for my granddaughter had a heavy duty inflation valve that you could unscrew and it would deflate instantly. The valve on this boat (also an Intex product) you must squeeze together to let air out and it took a long, long time to deflate. If this boat had the same valve that comes on the River Rub tube I would give it 5 stars.",3,Worked well with kids riding breakers at beach,1309737600,"07 4, 2011",0.0166
