0,A3EI4K5U61UZ7,B00005AM87,A Mother of 2 Kidlets,"[6, 7]",It was difficult to find a bike rack made that would fit my Ford Taurus and hold 4 bikes. This one does. While the rack is a tad heavy for me (not surprising because it needs to hold 4 bikes) it is functional. I recommend some extra velcro straps to help secure the wheels and keep them from moving in transit.,5,4-bike car rack,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",0.1398
1,A3EO2KVYIFE303,B00005AM87,Artur Grabowski,"[1, 1]",The metal mounting clips scratched the edges of my trunk lid. I'm more meticulous than the average person and was still not able to place the clips in such a way that they would not wear on the lip of my trunk lid. This issue also made the mounting process inconveniently long. I since added a tow hitch and hitch rack and am very happy with that setup. Overall quality seemed pretty good.,2,Clips scratch car and mounting is a pain,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",0.2677
2,A3W3XQY4GQRSIY,B00005AM87,DAVID B SIMMONS,"[1, 1]","I have 1500 miles on this rack so far, and I load it down pretty heavily with four bikes. I love this rack, especially for the money. With this, I feel confident taking our bikes on nearly every road trip we take. The straps are starting to show some wear, so I try my best to be careful so they'll last as long as possible. I see getting another 1500 miles before running into trouble. I use this on a 2000 Toyota Sienna, and it looks like it was made for it. It's a challenge to get four bikes to fit on there (at first). There is a learning curve, but once you figure out how to arrange the pedals and which direction to face the handle bars, you can load the bikes pretty quickly. Just experiment until they fit just right. Yes, you'll look out your rear view mirror for the first 20 miles, but worry not. Those bikes aren't going anywhere.",5,Excellent value and investment,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",0.2961
3,APRJDKS9CHS61,B00005AM87,Frankie Frankie,"[2, 2]","Couldn't quite tell if this would work, but I took a chance and this rack does fit a 2005 Toyota 4Runner, with the spoiler installed, which I believe is optional on this year (mine had the spoiler when purchased as a used vehicle). The top straps pass under the spoiler without touching it, the hooks on the top straps then fit into the slot above the rear hatch. I was quite impressed with ease of installation once I figured things out. The hooks/straps for the rack all attach various places around the 4Runner's rear door (not to the fender, bumper, or other external area), so it is possible to raise/open the rear door/hatch with the rack in place. I have not tried to do so with a bike on the rack, but it would probably work, at least for partially raising the door, though I'm sure is not recommended. The padding/design seems adequate to protect the 4Runner's paint job. I have not used the rack extensively yet and only loaded 3 bikes (not the 4 maximum) but I'm quite happy so far and will add to this review if problems develop. The straps have a partial stretch section which allows you to really get them tight, and they are PLENTY long. Good design as it appears so far.Update October 2011: Used it all summer, no problems and I'm 100% happy with this bike rack. On my 4Runner, I can lift the tailgate with one bike mounted on the rack, causing no damage to vehicle but it is heavy and would cause the gate to slam shut if I was not careful. I don't recommend this procedure., but sometimes you just need to grab something without removing the bike!",5,fits 2005 Toyota 4Runner with spoiler,1310515200,"07 13, 2011",0.3113

6,A2QBAYRY8SKL6O,B00005AM87,Kailash Gangar,"[1, 1]",Looked everywhere locally for it. Found it on Amazon and am happy w/ the purchase. We used it and it worked beautifully. It was easy to install/uninstall.,5,Excellent Product,1311638400,"07 26, 2011",0.418
7,A21CR6QBS7CAFR,B00005AM87,RD RD,"[3, 3]","The bike rack is heavy, has a solid feel and is well constructed. Installation is very easy, go to the allenracks website for an instructional video. It took no more than 5 minutes to install the bike rack. I was able to install the rack on a 1999 Saturn over the rear spoiler and on a Mazda MPV mini van with no assistance (See pictures). The rack easily accommodates 4 adult bikes, if one is transporting women's bike purchase theAllen Tension Bar Bicycle Cross-Bar Adaptor($20)as it makes mounting the bike a lot easier. Even without the tension bar the tie downs on the rack swivel to accommodate bikes of different configurations. There are 3 pairs of ties that secure the rack to the trunk, all of which are very easy to install.I have used this rack on two 100 mile trips with no issues. The bikes were stable, and did not shift during transit. I did use additional ties to secure the wheels. I would highly recommend this rack.Amazon has the best price on this rack. Consider purchasing the tension bar and some extra straps.",5,Excellent bike rack,1252886400,"09 14, 2009",0.238
