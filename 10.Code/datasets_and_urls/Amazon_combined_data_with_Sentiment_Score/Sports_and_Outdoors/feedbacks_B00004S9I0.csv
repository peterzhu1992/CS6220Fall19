It makes a whole breakfast from bacon and eggs and pancakes. Flip it over and it is an excellent grill for meats and fish. And it works well on gas and charcoal cook surfaces as well as electric. I has a gas stove and am always in awe whenever I use it since it makes cooking so much fun. And the price is excellent. I have scads of cast iron from this grill/griddle, to fry pans of all sizes, and cornbread pans and other items. Stuff never wears out and gets handed down generation to generation.",5,A classic gem ~ must own,1038441600,"11 28, 2002",0.3464
1,A24FY1EBJ7EWLH,B00004S9I0,Cabushka,"[0, 0]","I just received this item a few days ago and it's well on its way toward being a kitchen favorite. I followed the directions for seasoning, cooked some eggs on it this morning and they did not stick! It was great to do scrambled eggs on one end and over-easy on the other. Around 25 years ago, I got my first cast iron fry pan. What an ordeal to season it! This is already performing beautifully and can only get better!",5,I'm Loving This Item Already!,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",0.339
2,A1M2T0J45TTE64,B00004S9I0,G. Powell,"[118, 122]","I have a cheap gas stove and I always wanted one of those expensive versions. (You know the one's on everyone's TV kitchen) ... This griddle cooks pancakes, french toast, cheese sandwiches and eggs on the smooth side wonderfully. Just kick the burners on high, let it warm up, knock them back to medium until its hot evenly and throw the food on. Don't worry about heating an empty pan, Cast iron can take it. When a water droplet bounces and its not smoking its ready. (Smoking is too hot, duh!)The other great use is to put it in the oven, turn the broiler/oven on and let it heat up. Then toss on the steaks, ribs, or fish! Yum!The Lodge seasoning is ok for that first time cooking. You do need to wash off the manufacturing dirt, and a good coat of oil is a good way to start that carbon buildup.On the down side, the burner grates on my stove instersect with the indented handle slots. There is a slight lip on the pan so that it rests directly on the grate. If you slide the pan down just slightly and to the center of the stove, it sets in just right. But I could see that on not all stoves it would fit as well. The alternative would be to get two of the open cast iron rings that fit on the stove grates and put the griddle on top of them. (These rings are normally designed to aid in holding a small pot over a larger more open gas stove grate) (I got two cast iron grates from the hardware store. I think they were storm grates. In an outside fire I burnt the paint off them and now they work fine holding the griddle up off the stove. Also Lodge has a 8 castiron trivet which looks like it should work as well.)It is heavy, yup. It doesn't fit in my sink very well, but then if you've ever watched the guy at the bar & grill clean his grill, he does it right on the stove. So while the giddle is hot, give it a good scrape with the spatula, and wipe it with a paper towel. You'll get 90% of the food/grease off the pan. Then a quick rinse when it cools down gets the rest. (In the sink put a large sponge under the edge and one behind it to avoid scratching things.)Also if you cook bacon, or other high fat food, it splatters. Since the lip is low, it doesn't catch the grease spatters the way a good fry pan does. More stove cleanup...While it grills ok on the stove top, It's not a replacement for the charcoal cooker. You will need a good vent hood to catch the smoke. (Well yeah)Also if you plan on using it inside your oven, measure first! Not all ovens are 20 wide inside.(I have much older cast iron fry pans and everything that's been said about them becoming smooth and non stick is true. Took about 5 years of off and on cooking to do it, and 10 to become perfect. Grandma's pans went to my mother so I had to season my own pans myself. This pan because of the dual sided cooking only took about a month to equal that old fry pan.",5,Great stove top giddle/Or use for broiling!,1015459200,"03 7, 2002",0.1997
3,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B00004S9I0,Joanna Daneman,"[37, 37]","For pancakes, this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly, and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but...you...must...season this and instruct well-meaning helpers NOT, repeat, NOT to use any soap of any kind, sponge, steel wool pad, on the griddle. Ever. If you are worried about cleaning it, you can scrub the surface with a hot, clean water, handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel. After seasoning, pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast. Just remember about the seasoning and the No-Soap.",4,Worth the trouble of cast-iron care,1070496000,"12 4, 2003",0.2613
4,A2MSQNPTNAAGL1,B00004S9I0,P. Cannon,"[26, 30]","I own at least a dozen of the lodge cookware pieces and love them very much but this is not such a great thing. I went through the normal in the oven seasoning that always works just great but this thing warped like a potato chip! It did flatten back out as it cooled but everytime I put it on my two burners to use, it warps again making it very rocky on the stove top and my pancakes looked like Picasso made them. It always flattens back out but it's really a pain in the ah hum to use. The grill side set off all the smoke detectors and left a greasey film on everything in my whole house and I was only using a med low burner, well, at least the door stopped squeeking! It is also a bit to narrow for two rows of pancakes unless you make them very small and the center doesn't get hot enough. Just when you thought you've experienced all the unpleasantness of this pan, you then go to clean it and discover you'd be better off just throwing it out in the yard for the dogs to lick clean! I love you Lodge, I really do but I'll stick to outside grilling and my larger lodge skillet for hotcakes, the 13 inch round pan is a dream as are all the other pieces I own. As for this heavy sticky thing well, I may try it out on my fire ring next cookout and if that doesn't work out, it's yard sale time!",2,a big warping heavy messy piece!,1078963200,"03 11, 2004",0.1397
