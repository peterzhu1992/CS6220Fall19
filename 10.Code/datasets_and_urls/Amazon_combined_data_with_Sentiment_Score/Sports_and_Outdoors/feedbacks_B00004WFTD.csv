I use them in the kitchen and in the garage, from sharpening a shovel (yes, it really works better when the edge is sharp) to sharpening steak knives. These were purchased to add to my truck tool box, small, easy to stow away. They work very well, just remember to let the sharpening edge do the work for you, do NOT press down hard, you will just remove the diamond media and ruin the surface.",5,"Excellent product, can't go wrong purchase",1363996800,"03 23, 2013",0.3562

2,A313WZDAC70NT8,B00004WFTD,dallasfan2326,"[0, 0]",Good product. Great small set to put in a pack and use in the woods. Not really user friendly on bigger knife but it will get the job done. I wish they came double sided so I could carry just on but this is a great product non the less.,5,Awesome Product!!,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",0.4131
3,A1MNN0ZMHYPJDU,B00004WFTD,Daniel Stephens,"[2, 2]",Great little stone set... These make a colorful gift and I keep a set of these with my luggage when I travel because they are lightweight and only need water for lubrication...,5,Great Product...,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",0.5327
4,AHA4XNFLSG7JH,B00004WFTD,D. Schwemin,"[5, 6]","Product arrived missing the Green 1200 grit stone. I only received the Red 600 grit, and Blue 325 grit stones. Although DMT makes a great product, I think these sharpening stones are too small and awkward for sharpening knives. I will stick with the Diafold sharpeners from DMT.",2,Missing stone.,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",0.0616
5,A21BH5QF60775Z,B00004WFTD,joereno,"[0, 0]","Fit in my ski sharpener tool and are excellent for honing a fine edge. Use water sprayed on them and the ski, though, to lengthen life and increase effectiveness.",5,Excellent for honing ski edges.,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",0.5544
6,A38LZR92U8TWQX,B00004WFTD,Johnny B,"[0, 0]","I've really come around to diamond sharpeners, and most especially to the DMT products. All the DMT stuff is great. These sharpeners are small enough to pack into a survival tin and I use them for field touch-ups of all my bladed tools. They stack one on another and you can wrap that with cordage, rubber bands, etc. There are no handles, you'll need to prop the sharpening stones against a flat surface, or, hold the stone as you would a file and move the stone across the blade (a good solution for a machete or large field knife). A knife is considered essential for bushcraft, survival, and to me, everyday life. Keeping that knife sharp is just important as having it in the first place. Don't get these as your first DMT sharpener, but get them for your 'always with you' bag soon. Water clean-up, water to cool and clear the blade during sharpening. Break-in consists of light use, but use normally, for a dozen or so times. Keep rinsing and working the blade. If the sharpeners need to get cleaned, sprinkle on baking soda and scrub with a brush and rinse. No oil. Ever.Clean, light, easy to use and keep up, small, essential. Made in USA.",5,Good kit,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",0.158

8,A1GBHCA10Z3JR,B00004WFTD,Randall S Russell,"[0, 0]","A great little set of honing stones. Use water rather than oil, does not require a lot of pressure. Leaves a good edge, worth the money.",5,Small but useful,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",0.3049
9,A3H3VGH77T5J3H,B00004WFTD,Sifo Dyas,"[0, 0]","I have a decent collection of knives and swords, all of which I maintain regularly, in addition to a set of chisels and hatchets. These are a bit on the small side, but they are very portable, are easy to clean, and don't require oil for use. I threw a set in with a spare knife in my EDK, no regrets.",5,"A bit small, but perfect for hunting knifes, pocket knives, and swords",1390953600,"01 29, 2014",0.369
10,A1HW9DAJBYXGDV,B00004WFTD,WAYA,"[0, 0]","These little guys put a nice edge on my knives, the only drawback I could see was they're on the small side, So you won't easily be sharpening a blade larger than your average pocket knife or maybe a filleting knife in the tacklebox... Bowies and such would just be awkward at best!",4,Good for the trunk or tackle box,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",0.6589
