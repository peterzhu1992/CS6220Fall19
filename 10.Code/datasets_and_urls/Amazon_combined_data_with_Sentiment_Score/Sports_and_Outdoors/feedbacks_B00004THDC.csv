Believe me, I looked all over the internet, looked at all those Youtube reviews etc etc. This is what I found and what I purchased. It 's the best!. Buy it, no hassle, easy to use, comes in a handy bag with all the goodies. The steady view (IS) is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It 's like a digital camera that you focus.",5,Canon 10X30 binoculars,1311206400,"07 21, 2011",0.2831

Stabilization is quick and the press to hold button saves battery life. You can still see fine and use them as regular binoculars with out pressing the stabilization button and I like having a choice. One tip, use the stabilization when you Initially adjust your right and left eye once. It's easier than non-stabilized.Love these things for bird watching!",5,This will knock your socks off!,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",0.2547
2,A3639Z6O5JBLIZ,B00004THDC,Brucer,"[4, 4]",Another poster mentioned only a 1 year warranty but the box (purchased on Amazon) has a sticker that says 3 years and the warranty card in the box confirmed it. I've been using a good pair of zoom binoculars for watching boats and they are fine if I have a tripod. This Canon Image Stabilization (IS) 10x30 solves the problem beautifully. They are far more useful than standard binoculars because you can concentrate on the details of whatever you're watching without straining to hold them steady. They are very comfortable to hold as they are compact and light weight. Everybody who tries them breaks into a big smile when they press the IS button!,5,Fantastic Binoculars - 3 Year Warranty!,1333411200,"04 3, 2012",0.4864

Note that you must hold the IS button down, it's not an on/off switch. That said, the best binoculars I have ever used. I bought a 2nd pair as a gift.",4,Excellent Optics,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.358
4,A35QZUUZ3WMVUL,B00004THDC,Faust,"[0, 0]","These kick ass, they work as described I just wish they had more magnification, the stead button is a major bonus, just wish they had color action like fde, desert tan",5,These things rule,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",0.8674
5,A26IU7DJZRREZE,B00004THDC,GMS,"[0, 0]",I chose this rating because the binoculars are as they were described. They work well and were at a price I was willing to spend. These certainly are expensive enough.,5,Canon Binocs,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",0.2044
6,A2CM63X1NLPFHW,B00004THDC,KenCT,"[0, 0]","I've had these bino's for a few years and they continue to impress me. They were a bit expensive but the image stabilization was worth it. I estimate they allow me to see objects clearly of unit with double the power. I use them at auto races, birdwatching, and other sporting events. Highly recommended.",5,Image stabilzation makes all the difference.,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",0.3197
7,A14MZJTZAQS6CV,B00004THDC,L. Williams Paddle foot,"[1, 1]","Canon makes the best stuff and now these are my favorite Binoculars. They work GREAT! I always see a lot of unsteadiness when I hold a pair of Binoculars for any period of time while zooming in as far as possible. These though have a button on them which engages a gyroscope (That's what the documentation says) of some sort and totally steadied the image. I walked around using them and they work GREAT! I have yet to try them aboard and boat of from a moving land vehicle, but as the Documentation also states there are apt to be problems with that sort of use. I totally recommend these as being Fantastic Binoculars. Canon always seems to cos more than other devices. I also own a few of their Cameras and Lenses, but you get what you pay for. I have come to like Canon products very much and plan on using their products in the future.",5,I LOVE this,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",0.2926

9,A2JU77JV0NWLDK,B00004THDC,rob,"[1, 1]",Bought these as a gift for my mom. She still goes on about how great they are. In her backyard it's like watching a documentary on birds with the auto stabilization on. What did people do before IS?! Thinking about buying a second pair for myself!,5,A gamechanger with IS!,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",0.2853
