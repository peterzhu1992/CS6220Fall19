Your hand will NOT slip on this gator grip! The overal demensions are great, about 1/8 inch longer than a similar Gerber straight edged knife I have from Gerber (but it has a different handle). I am very satisfied with the 3 Gerber knives I've bought thusfar, including THIS kinife, the smaller straight-edged (e.g. non-serrated) one I already had before this purchase, and the Gerber Prodigy (survival) knife I bought recently.",5,Gerber Folding Clip Point Serrated Gator Kife,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",0.4391
2,A19FRW264WZTGP,B00004WA4U,Bunson Honeydew,"[7, 7]","I love the way the knive feels and its durability is great. As others pointed out, it's not perfect like fancier brands. I bought mine in the late 1990's. I worked as an EMT and needed a durbale knive to cut seatbelts and for other rescue purposes.I'm not a hunter, but I have taken this outdoors for hikes and fishing. This is my second Gerber product. I own the original multi-tool - Gerber's version of the Leatherman. That got a lot of use.Bottom line: A great value to have in your collection.",4,Great for the money,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",0.2079
3,A3GJ7TFW6IU5RV,B00004WA4U,Dan H.,"[1, 1]",As usual Gerber does not disappoint. I had a similar Gerber knife many years ago and loved it. Quality appears to have remained very high. the grip is comfortable and the locking mechanism seems solid. extremely sharp. I have not had it long enough to comment on how well it holds its edge. I would buy again and recommend it,5,I love this knife,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",0.306
4,A2N75ADJSRW0AH,B00004WA4U,Jeff Kraus,"[26, 29]","Overall, I'd say that this is a fantastic knife. The other glowing reviews for the knife are absolutely correct in terms of its solid feel and sharpness. The lock is excellent, and the serrated edge is just about perfect. For the price, I don't know if you can do any better in terms of folding knives.But then the unexpected let down.I took it with me on a kayaking trip to an island off the coast of Florida. I had three knives with me, all of them Gerber knives of different types. All three were stainless steel blades, one being a PFD knife, and the other a full tang non-folding knife.Over the course of the trip out there, all three knives were exposed to significant amounts of salt water. Both of the other knives had made this trip before, so I didn't give it a second thought. I guess I should have, because opening the knife the next day revealed a blade covered in rust spots. Of course, I cleaned it off as best I could when I brought it home, but there are still a couple dozen rust marks on the face of the blade that just won't come off.So I know that it's my fault for not washing off the blade immediately. I guess since the other two knives have had no problems, I just didn't think about it. With those knives I can just wash the dried salt residue off of them whenever I get around to it. And with a limited fresh water supply (whatever I can fit in my kayak along with the rest of the gear), I need to be careful with how much I use.I guess to me the question is if Gerber can make these two other knives impervious to salt water, then why not this one?Maybe there are others out there with better experiences in salty environments, and if anyone would like to mention those experiences, feel free to leave a comment with this review. I welcome dissenting opinions, but I can only review based on my own personal experiences. And overall I love the knife, but it had to lose points for rusting after one day.",3,A Fine Knife With One (Big) Caveat,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",0.2196
5,A1EJWXCAAMHLKX,B00004WA4U,J. Moorse Moose,"[2, 2]",I could hold onto this knife in a puddle of motor oil! Great rubber grip and very sharp (I found this out the hard way!)The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I wish it had a peg on the blade to allow for single hand extension.,4,"Great grip, very sharp",1246752000,"07 5, 2009",0.4632
6,A11RP9Q3S6IIMD,B00004WA4U,joe r.,"[0, 0]",This is a really nice knife. The rubber handle is a bit bulky in your pocket. Blade has staid shape for 7 months. Broke the tip finally. I abuse this knife and it's held up.,5,Great knife. Great price.,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",-0.1166
7,A2O9KQG7VRGYGN,B00004WA4U,Leonidas,"[0, 0]",A little too big for me to carry everyday in my pocket (I wear slacks to work). But I just repurposed it for camping and fishing and it is perfect. High quality at a low price and made in the USA. Cant lose with this one.,5,Great nife at a great price,1374969600,"07 28, 2013",0.1896
8,A1SKUWYQVIQLTM,B00004WA4U,michael,"[0, 0]",this knife is rock solid when open and its grip is second to none even in the snow and freezing wet conditions. ive used this knife for everything from carving my name into lean-to's on rainy days to opening cans and as said in previous reviews it doesnt hold an edge for long but thats why you carry a small stone or just hone it up before each trip. for the price i dont know why everyone doesnt own atleast one!,5,perfect knife,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",0.0043
9,AV15W3FPLQPN0,B00004WA4U,MikeDidIt Have a GREAT One!,"[0, 0]","I've had this for a week now so I can't speak to its longevity but it seems like an excellent knife. It's light enough for everyday carry in jeans or dress slacks, but It's a good sized knife so be sure to measure so you know what you are getting because it does take up some room if your pockets are small.Grip: excellentLanyard clip: NoneOne-hand opening: Not possible so far (though I suspect a little silicone spray might make it possible)Lock: seems excellentBlade: I'm not a knife fanatic so I can't tell you about the quality of materials in the blade but I can tell you that the blade is very sharp out of the box! Also, I love the angled tip for ripping packing tape (on boxes) so I don't have to use the blade side.Knife made in United States. The case is made in China.If anything changes quality wise I will be sure to update this review. So far I'm VERY happy with it.",5,Excellent knife,1361232000,"02 19, 2013",0.7374
10,A39E2RQQ8XH23J,B00004WA4U,nom de plume,"[0, 0]","The best feature of this Gerber is its rubber grip. It is so comfortable in your hand. Wet or dry it does not slip in your hand. The steel is not very easy to sharpen but it holds its edge extremely well. You really cannot find a better general use pocket knife. If you're using this where there is a lot of moisture you will absolutely love the grip.There are only two things that I would like to have seen built into the Gator.1) a thumb pin so that you can open this one handed.2) a hole in the handle for a lanyard.I find myself turning to my Gator more than I do my Spyederco's, other Gerbers, CRKT's, Ka Bar's and Sog's. It's my absolute favorite utility knife.",5,all around excellent knife,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",0.4524
