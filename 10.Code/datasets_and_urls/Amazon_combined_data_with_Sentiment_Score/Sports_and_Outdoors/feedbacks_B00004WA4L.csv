This set has a multitude of tools to get a majority of minor jobs completed.The body and handles are made of a matte finished stainless steel.The needle nosed pliers allow for a one-handed release. A crimping tool is integrated into the pliers for stripping cables and cutting small wire. An 8 cm and 3 ruler are integrated into the handles. The file, screwdrivers, bottle opener, Phillips screwdriver, and knife are all easy to access and operate. A plastic lock allows for safe use of the tools. For the price and the number of tools, this still sets the standard for multipurpose tool kits.The nylon sheath is rugged and allows for a vertical carry.Other Products Tried:Leatherman ToolkitOverall, I am pleased with the Tool Kit.",5,Excellent well-rounded all purpose tool set,1301270400,"03 28, 2011",0.2205

I have had these Gerbers for year, and only had one failure ( I was definately not using it as directed ) This has a great multi-purpose saw and bit set. I have already used it quite a bit with no complaints.",5,The Right Tool,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",0.3787

Only bad thing I can say about it is that when it's in wrench form, the head wiggles from side to side a little. I never found the need to use it one handed. It didn't really work anyway, always got stuck sliding it in and out. I need to get a replacement soon.",4,Love Lost,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",-0.2755
