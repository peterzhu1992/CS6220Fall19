0,A1II9F7V7C5EE0,B00000ELZ5,C. Richmond,"[0, 0]","I sincerely hope anyone who thinks about buying these uses common sense when reading the two DUBIOUS posts that gave these 1 star. In my opinion....they are bogus posts. I have these....and here are my findings.1. They are awkward at first, as with any new skill you try when lifting weights.2. Someone said he couldn't use his normal weight when doing incline press.....if you can do 90 lb incline press WITH DUMBBELLS then these hooks will NOT hamper your ability in doing incline presses with the same weight. That doesn't even make sense. However....if you never or rarely do certain exercises with dumbbells then yes, you will have to lower the weight...at first. Anyone who lifts knows if you go from a bar to dumbbells then you will have to take time to get used to each arm lifting independently.3. Yes....it will take a few times to get used to placing your bench just right under the bar that holds the hooks for you. I do not bump the bar when using these. And just like lifting on your own, without a spotter, with a barbell.....it's no different with dumbbells. You need to be able to muscle them back up to hook the bar.4. They are NOT made to be dropped!!! They are made to hook on the bar when your set is done. I read a review on here that complained that they get banged up or something when you drop the dumbbells. Duh! You wouldn't throw your barbell on the floor when you got done bench pressing, would you? No....then why would you think you would throw these on the floor? It doesn't make sense. These hooks are designed to be placed BACK on the bar after your set...NOT thrown on the floor.5. They are comfortable...to me. Unless you don't find padded material comfortable, you will find them comfortable too. Someone actually said that if you have big hands then you can't use these. What????? They fit ON THE HANDLE! If your hands don't fit around a dumbbell handle then it's not the hooks fault. They take up ZERO space on the handle, other than adding just a few centimeters in thickness around the handle.6. In my opinion....they also help prevent shoulder injuries from trying to muscle up the dumbbells to their position. There are a few videos on youtube demonstrating these hooks. There is also one that shows how to use chains hanging from a power cage or from rafters in your basement hooked on to these as a spotting system in case you can't muscle them back up to rehang them back on the bar. I have the chains hanging from the top of my power cage and attached to the hooks so I can go to exhaustion on my last set without the worry of dropping the weights on the floor.",5,I've had these for about a year.,1385769600,"11 30, 2013",0.0204
1,A1AHG76Y8S89BJ,B00000ELZ5,David De Sousa The Automation and Control Guy,"[13, 13]","This is really an excellent accessory to improved dumbbell training at Home, or you can even bring then to the gym.The power hooks provides the user with a method to perform and accomplish heavier dumbbell training procedures safer and easier, resulting in maximum training benefits from your pair of dumbbells, reducing the risk of injury when handling heavy weights.Each power hook comes with a leather strap that attaches the power hook to the dumbbell bar. This way for example you can position your loaded dumbbells in the overhead barbell, lay in the bench, and grab the dumbbells that are already positioned in a convenient way to perform presses or flies without the risk of injuring yourself when to try to take the heavy dumbbells from the flour to the starting position for a dumbbell bench press or fly.I bought mines about six months ago, and I love them. They allow me to handle heavy weights safely when there no one near to help you with the weights. This is even more convenient if you train alone at home.",5,Excellent Accessory for Safe Dumbbell Training.,1154217600,"07 30, 2006",0.463
2,A3S12HXPVWTBO8,B00000ELZ5,f355911tt,"[1, 1]","I use these for the 100lb dumbells and they make all the difference in the world. I have a bad back so they save my back first. No more struggling to do incline presses. I use them on the smith machine to support them from. It is more work to set them up, however your tendons and joints will appreciate it greatly. I have large hands so my only complaint is that the hooks that go around the dumbell are in the way of my grip, but that is a minor trade off compared to having to jerk 2- 100lb dumbells from the ground up to your chest. It does take time to get used to them and you will be weaker because of the grip/ hook interference. I used to get 18 reps with the 100s on incline, and with the hooks, I've lost about 3 reps per set and do 15 reps/set now. If all gyms had these, it would save the dumbells from getting bent as guys that can't handle them, drop them. These have saved my lower biceps/ forearm from a chronic injury due to jerking the weight up to your chest. Love them. I use them for dumbell shrugs as well as they keep the dumbells away from your legs during the exercise. Oh, and it will definitely start a conversation as nobody at the gym has ever seen anything like it, they all want to use them, but nobody wants to go buy there own.",4,Use them everytime!!,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",0.0922
