I bought this for my son but have been using it more than him lately!",5,excellent net for soccer training!,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",0.3296

She practices for hours with this rebounding net. A set of metal stakes keeps it securely in the ground for kick after kick. This might just be my favorite purchase of the year.",5,Great Practice Net,1388275200,"12 29, 2013",0.2256
2,A1MJZAV7WH0LC7,B00004NKIQ,Life Adventurist,"[3, 3]","The kids love it! One issue - the net came with a few broken links. Big bummer! I contacted the company upon discovery (a couple of days after Christmas). I haven't heard back from them yet, which also disappoints me. I know Amazon would have exchanged it for me, but I recycled the box the morning before putting it together. Whoops!Learn from me! Order this if you're looking at it, but inspect it when you get it.",4,The rebounder works great!,1358640000,"01 20, 2013",-0.0672

I hope it lasts a long time,5,We've had it for 6 months outside and works great,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",0.0925
4,A2N9ESSELDUEY,B00004NKIQ,ThunderNuts79,"[4, 5]","I bought this item for my 5 year old nephew as a Christmas present. The setup of the net was relatively easy, I would recommend using a partner just for the sheer size of the rebounder. The only semi-difficult part was stretching the rebounder net to attach it to the frame. This took some strength which was not a problem for me, but I could see some smaller people having issues with it(I am not bragging or a chauvinist, just saying I am a big man and have more strength than most). My nephew loves this item and it appears that it will last a long time. I am very please with this item and would definitely recommend it to everyone.",5,Great Product,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",0.4709
