1,A6VPK7X53QNAQ,B00008GKDN,AmazonDiva Keep Calm and Carry On.,"[43, 53]","I love this griddle as it is such a convenient size. The heavy base means that you can cook your omelet on low flame and it would cook through nicely before you flip it. On lighter pans the omelets start burning on one side while the other side is still liquid. I make tortillas/ and Indian rotis and paranthas on it too. It works very well as you have to heat the griddle on high flame for perfect rotis and teflon coated girdles just get runied very quickly if you use them for high flame dry cooking. Cast iron is non-stick and you can take it to high heat without worries...and even use your metal spatulas on it.The only reason why it gets 4 stars is that the handle heats up too and you have to use a pot holder to move the girdle around and remember never to touch it while cooking. The other reason is that since it is made of cast iron you always have to hand wash it and wipe it dry to store. Other wise next time you need it you will be scraping off rust spots from the griddle. It also takes some time to reach a consistent temperature, so if I'm just making one quick omelet or fried egg I still bring out the old teflon. You may ask why would I deduct a star for these reasons as these points would apply to any cast iron cookware, but these factors make it a little less convenient to use this griddle often. And it loses a point when compared with other non-cast iron cookware.Overall though, this griddle is an invaluable addition to my kitchen, especially for my Indian breads.",4,Heavy base is great for omelettes and tortillas but handwash and keep from rusting!,1168473600,"01 11, 2007",0.204

However, since it's cast iron, that simply means that I need to give it a few extra minutes of heating time. And it does heat uniformly given that few extra minutes even though my burners are at fault.That was my biggest reason why I desired a cast iron skillet in the first place. Because the metal one I have just didn't retain heat. It didn't matter how long I left it on the burner, the edges would not heat up.But cast iron has nice heat convection properties which means that I can make uniform pancakes every time.Ideally, even if only cooking three pancakes on this griddle, they will come out quite small. If you want the restaurant style flapjacks, you'll need a bigger pan.

This pan is great for making those 3 egg omlets, pancakes, fried eggs, etc. The low lip makes it easy to get the spatula under the eggs and flip them.

On a campfire that of course won't be a problem.However if you have limited space in your kitchen cabinet get the combo cooker. The lid is nearly as large as this one and you get the fry pan as well.On the plus side, this pan being thin fits right under the stack of cast iron pans I already own.

Based on the reviews and the price I thought it'd be hard to go wrong.Initially, even though we closely followed the instructions (no soap, oil after every use, etc) we found food stuck to the iron very, very easily. In fact, the first couple times we used them we nearly gave up because they were so difficult to cook with and clean. For example, we fried a couple of eggs and about half of the eggs remained glued to the cooking surface.We decided to buy a can of PAM non-stick spray and that helped A LOT. Even though we continue to keep them well-oiled while they are in the cabinet and clean with a 3M abrasive pad, we now use PAM before we cook and we've had much better luck.The best thing I can tell about cast-iron is the heat conductivity and evenness. They get hot very quickly and hold heat for a long time. And for the price they are a steal.

42,APVUOXZ3DTV37,B00008GKDN,Nicholas Hull,"[1, 1]","I bought the griddle to use on my new induction cooker as an interface plate - in other words I put the griddle on the induction cooker first, then put a regular pan on top of It to heat. This allows me to use my existing 'cheap' pans with my induction cooker until I can gradually replace them with steel bottomed pans.The griddle works way better than I expected. There is no significant difference between heating a pan of water placed on the griddle as heating water in an induction ready pan (I only have 2 of induction pans at the moment). A cup of water boiled in 45 seconds in an induction ready pan (amazing) and about 20 seconds longer with the griddle in between. I can deal with that!It's a shame that induction cooker manufacturers don't sell 'affordable' interface plates - I've seen them online for $80-$100+!!!! This method works for me and cost less than $15!",5,Great addition to my Induction cooker,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",0.1615

But by putting this griddle on the induction cooktop I can use my lightweight aluminum pans and ceramics too. True, I lose a bit of heat efficiency but not enough to make a difference. The low lip on this griddle lets me use my pans with handles easily. I have larger Lodge cast iron pans that will not let me do this.

I have 4 dutch ovens, and a multitude of 12 and 10 inch skillets. But I didn't have any flat ones. Did I need this piece? Did it meet a need none of my others were meeting? No. But I thought for the price, why not add it to the collection. I wish I did sooner. The pre-seasoning on it is excellent. It worked like a champ from the get go. And unlike a lot of other 'pre-seasoned- pieces I have bought, there was zero sticking and it cleaned up with a rinse of water and a dry towel. Boom, done.Eggs, any style, have cooked perfectly with zero sticking. Bacon, steak, chicken, etc... have all come out great. I love this piece.",5,Love it,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",0.1785

I tried, I really did to make beautiful crepes the likes of which I had in France all to no avail. Nothing to do with the pan and everything to do with me apparently. I do love this pan though. It is wonderful for pancakes and probably anything else you may want to cook. This is the lightest Lodge pan I own and it is so nice to work with. No hot spots, no cool spots just perfectly cooked pancakes that were made after my bitter dissapointment with the crepe batter. If you are not crepe-challenged (as I am) I highly recommend this pan.

Laroe,"[3, 3]","Cast Iron is making a comeback!It's healthier than non-stick, cheaper, lasts forever, retains heat like a champ, and there's just something cool about how rustic it is.This pan has low sides, so it's great for anything that won't spill over the sides -- especially if you're going to lift it with a spatula. It's the perfect size for personal home made pizza, great for pancakes, and anything you'd use a griddle for.There is simply nothing better for warming or toasting tortillas or making grilled cheese.Clean up is a breeze - just throw some salt on and wipe it with a paper towel. If you really need to rinse stuff out of one of your cast iron pans -- you can use water, then just throw it back on the burner to let the residual heat dry it off.Every guy needs one of these and a 10 inch lodge skillet.
