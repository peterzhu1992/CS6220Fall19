0,A10GLVITSITGSA,B00006OALR,Captain Packrat Squeek!,"[7, 8]","I've owned my XLT since shortly after it came out, and it is absolutely the best knife I've ever owned, even better than the SwissChamp I'd carried for 10 years prior. I work as a computer tech, and this knife has about 90% of the tools I need to fix a computer, all in a (relatively) small package that I can carry in my pocket. It's got things like Torx and Hex bits, and the bit driver is exactly the perfect size for tightening the little nuts on either side of a D-SUB connector (VGA, Parallel, Serial port, etc). Even the little straight pin has come in handy for resetting PDAs. I have used every single tool on this knife except the fish scaler. Heck, even the toothpick has proven useful!",5,"It's not a Swiss Army Knife, it's the entire Swiss Army!",1204416000,"03 2, 2008",0.3492
1,A3775OP5VTX5ON,B00006OALR,Coolkayaker ck1,"[1, 1]","I was scared off from the XAVT, the big brother to this XLT, by all the people saying that it was too big to carry and use. So, I got the XLT instead.Well, this XLT is NOT the size of a pack of cigarettes, it is NOT almost one pound of stainless steel in weight (it's only 54% of one pound, actually), and it will not pull your pants down carrying it. Hyperbole by others can mislead the investigating buyer. I'll shoot you some facts and ways to think about things.The XLT is certainly not too big or heavy to carry--and now I question whether the XAVT would have been too big; perhaps I should have sprang for it. I may pick that one up in the future if I see it on sale (currently it's 40% more expensive than the XLT). The cost per tool on the XLT is about four bucks per tool, and on the XAVT is about four and a half buck per tool (divide number tools from price). So, something to consider.Victorinox Swiss Army SwissChamp XAVTThe XAVT is more of a collector's knife, and one might be paying for the display box, but it has many useful functions this XLT does not: more sizes of bits, not one but two magnifying glasses at 5x and 8x magnification (and designed to be used together to get 13x magnification!), clock, thermometer, etc. Conversely, it also has some redundancy (two exact same package hooks and two screwdrivers on the XAVT--see other reviews) and I wonder if Victorinox counts those twice to get 80 tools on the XVAT. The XLT has no truly redundant tools, but it does have similar tools such as the thick (i.e. takes up a lot of space on the handle that could be used for another tool) stand alone Phillips screwdriver, which is almost the same (not quite, but so close as to be essentially the same purpose) as the regular Phillips screwdriver on the bit set.Some of the tools are fairly useless, such as the pharmacist spatula. Some stir their coffee with it, one guy uses it as a mirror (why? the knife blade is a large high polished mirror, the spatula is matte). Huh!? Other tools would be better, certainly. Heck, give me the other magnifying glass, Victorinox!Many reviews on the build and quality of Victorinox, and I agree. Most of you already have another Victorinox knife, I'd assume. I will try to stick to a few things you may not know about this model XLT specifically.Weight: 8.75 ounces on my scale. Size: 3.5 inches long. 1 inch thick if you include the closed sticking out of the tools. And most importantly, the width (from side-to-side): 1 5/8 inches.This XLT, by Victorinox's counting (and a nice one page guide comes in the knife box), has 50 uses/tools. I find the Victorinox counting of uses to be accurate, but quite generous. Example: the little round keychain ring on the end of each Victorinox knife---that's one of the fifty tools! Another example: the bit driver is useful, and it comes with the black bits of various sizes, lovely. See the tiny black plastic piece that you move up to take out the bits? That's in and of itself one of the fifty tools! Yes, it's called the case for the bits. Please!The chisel is facing the wrong way for the ergonomics of the knife handle (you'll see when you get it) for proper use on wood (the thick knife handle would be against the wood). Victorinox, please just turn it around and cut the thumb groove on the other side.I purchased the Victorinox case for this knife, still to arrive, but had I waited, I'd not get it now. If I put a long Paracord lanyard on the key ring, I can have this at the bottom of my cargo pants pocket with the lanyard knot hanging out, I just grab and pull this out easily and quickly.Anyone on the fence about this and the XAVT, don't be scared of the other knife. It has some pros and cons, and I have never owned it but presented some ideas about it above. For those of us that carry an EDC medium to large blade folding knife already (approx 5-7 ounces), this XLT is no biggie. And you get a lot more tools ounce for ounce, so I like that (but still carry an EDC blade like the ZT0350Zero Tolerance ZT0350TS G10 Handle with Speed Safe and Tiger Stripe Blade (Non-serrated).Cell phone (4 ounce). Car keys (2-3 ounces). Put in one pocket as you carry these daily anyhow.XLT (8.75 ounces) in the other pocket. Nice overall weight distribution.So, this knife is far from massive. It's compact and tough and well made. It's less weight than most Leatehrman type tools. I do carry, especially since it clips to my belt loop on pants directly, the awesome SkeletoolLeatherman 830850 Skeletool CX Multitoolfor a quick carry. It's something to consider against any Swiss Army Knife depending on your use needs; I mention it here so that you can check it out, too. I love my Skeletool, also.Cheers and happy Swiss knifing.",5,True tips on XLT...too big? No.,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",0.1489
2,A1YWLEHS84C4O2,B00006OALR,GENE J. MARTIN CT/RAD DUDE,"[3, 4]","This is my second XLT and for two very good reasons - Quality and Functionality. I own several other MultiTools, including (but not limited to) Victorinox. For my various uses, this seems to be the best of the best. It is NOT oversized or bulky to carry, yet it has every basic function that a camper/outdoors person, hobbyist, or do-it- yourselfer might need. I was so impressed with the first XLT that the second one is going into my RV (a mini-motorhome). As other reviewers have pointed out, there are many less and more expensive knives of this type on the market today, but once again, you get what you pay for. It is my belief that no matter how fancy an item like this might be, it is totally useless if it does not do the job that it was designed for. By the same token, a cheap knife often results in failure during use AND subsequent personal injury. The XLT might be referred to as a knife, but it truly is so much more. Well worth the money. One note: Buy the carry case/sheath also; it adds to the convenience in every day use.",5,Second-to-None,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",0.201

4,A2NC8CG0J6NH7U,B00006OALR,John Sheppard,"[0, 0]","I collect SAKS. Seems like I can never find the right combination that I would create if I were were the designer. But this one pretty much does. I carried a Tinker for many years. It performs most of the tasks people require on a daily basis. And it is comfortable to carry and light weight. Then you get the other Tinker models. I look at it as Mission Creep! The more un-necessary tools you have, the more uses and tasks you create as an excuse to use them and buy bigger and fancier knives!I recently bought the massive and heavy knife which came with an elegant leather covered box. It has every tool SAK makes. The problem with the knife is there are several duplicate tools added for fluff just to make it more impressive and cost more. And for EDC it is too heavy, too massive even with the belt case.I love the Champ model and would normally be satisfied with that model. It has more than enough tools for almost any contingency. It is also very thick and heavy for EDC. Still, it was missing something -- more screwdrivers?! Then, I saw the XLT Champ model! It has the driver bits I find use for as well as the other tools.So, having said all that, the knife borders on being too heavy and bulky. But it is doable for EDC.What I would eliminate, thus reducing size and weight, would be the spatula, fish scaler, electrician's knife and hook. These are so seldom used if at all that it insults one's intelligence that a fine company like Victorinox would add them! A spatula? For what?! Cutting your cocain?? Use the knife blade. If you plan to fish you will have a scaler in your tackle box. Use the knife blade to strip wire, etc.In spite of what I would change, for now, I would still buy this knife again. It is worth it! But you have to get used to its bulk and weight. I suspect that I will have to carry it in a belt pouch tho. And the quality is unsurpassed!",5,Has everything you could use and still carry,1377302400,"08 24, 2013",0.1344

It is well thought out and has most everything you would want for smaller jobs requireing a handy multitool, removing a splinter (first thing I used it for and it was nice to have) to sewing leather. It is a bit large for pocket carry but could be in large pockets, I did get a belt case though . Although large I can use it and my hands are Medium to maybe large in size, but using two hands for somethings, most people could use it . I have 4-5 multitools and probably 250 sheath, belt, pocket knives, etc. some custom made but this little tool has impressed me . If you collect Swiss Knives (tools) or want it for jobs requireing small tools I think you will like it . The price here is good too .",5,Great Knife Tool,1296432000,"01 31, 2011",0.301
