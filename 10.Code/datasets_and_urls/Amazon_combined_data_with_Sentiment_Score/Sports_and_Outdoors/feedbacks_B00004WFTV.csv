They are my go-to for both house and field sharpening.The double sided F/EF is a great solution for a longer knife sheath accessory pouch, such as the Spec-Ops (which is 4 deep)Having a double sided grit sharpener like this is a huge benefit in the field over a traditional stone (especially if you have room for the handles). The red side works as a medium grit and the green side works as a fine grit; allowing you to quickly bring back an edge on the fly. The compact nature of the double sided/sandwiched system is what really shines for a limited space load-out such as in a long accessory pouch on a knife sheath or compact gear pouch. In it's original configuration, the double-sided Diafold is great, but if you need to conserve maximum space like I do, here's a little tip: remove the handles using a punch on the roll-pins. That will take the width down by 1/3... from 3/8 to 1/4. That might not sound like much, but it makes a huge difference when packing in micro storage areas like a knife sheath. For my use in the Spec-Ops sheath (Mini), due to the top flair of the inner kydex liner, I also remove the 1/2 handle attachment area (which otherwise works great to hold onto while sharpening). This results in the ability to store the sharpening system fully flat & flush in the 4 pouch, along with all my other critical gear (a big fire-steel, a magnesium block, and a smalls Altoids tin full of micro-repair gear). Note: the small and large Spec-Ops sheaths are mounted lower than on the Mini model, so this cut-down mod is not necessary.)Summary:if you are space limited but want dual stone versatility, then buy THIS folding sharpener, and reduce it in size as needed.Highly Recommended!",5,"Perfect One Sharpener solution, especailly for a longer sheath accessory pouch",1389484800,"01 12, 2014",0.2495

I have several good-sized old rectangular stones but its been so long I've forgotten where I got them and who made them.I selected a diamond sharpener as I found they work best on some stainless steel alloys I've encountered. I don't ordinarily use a diamond on anything else as it tends to remove metal more aggressively than stones/ceramic and the diamond sharpeners tend to wear out rather quickly. But admittedly diamond types do the job faster than stones.This is a replacement for my last diamond sharpener, which of course wore out.I've already given this item a preliminary workout by sharpening a stainless blade that was surprisingly hard and giving my Lanskys too much of a workout, but the edge was almost done. It took a bit of sweat and patience but the DMT performed well and now that tough stainless blade is a hair splitter.I then used this DMT on some other knives for a quick, couple of swipes edge touch-up.This DMT fits the bill. The handle fold conveniently and protects the sharpener surface when not in use, but when deployed offers a good size hand grip. I have no worry about the durability of the plastic, it will probably outlast the diamond.The sharpener rectangle is good enough size for small to large blades although I wouldn't use this for machetes, axes or even a CS Laredo. For blades that big I'll use something else.Because the two sides offered are Fine and Extra-Fine, this sharpener is primarily relegated to light touch-up. I have only two tests to determine if my blades are sharp to my satisfaction. 1) the ease of shaving hair; and 2) the thumbnail test.I like this product and do recommend it.

Tip: when using this as a typical bench whetstone, lean the far end of the sharpener on the table top. Only add water or use it dry - anything else will gum it up.

41,A1VI4DV0HKKUS6,B00004WFTV,TechnoAmazonian,"[2, 2]","Diamond Machining Technology Inc. (DMT) has a patent on true crystalline diamond coatings for their sharpeners. While others advertise diamonds, DMT's diamonds are truly sharp - making them the best functioning diamond sharpening tools available. You can read more about this and how to use the products at their web site[...]. Never use oil on diamonds as it can clog the grit - simply use then dry or with a little water. Use gentle pressure as the diamonds will do the work. I consider this double-sided unit to be the best all-around starter sharpener with course (blue) and fine (red). These two grits will meet most basic needs when used as directed. To establish a truly keen edge, consider their alignment system which holds the blade and stones at a constantly perfect angle, ensuring a perfectly angled and level sharpened edge[...]- noting it may cost several times more as it comes with several more grits. If you prefer a more universal power sharpener, consider the Work Sharp WSKTS motorized sharpener which is highly portable and flexible in its uses. Finally, sometimes a good old metal file (Bastard type) is the best way to put a quick initial edge on larger items like shovels and axes. Wear gloves and eye protection - and avoid breathing fine metal dust - be safe!",5,Sharpen with Sharp Diamonds,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",0.4447

I had an old hatchet that I ground a rough edge on my bench grinder, then took it all the way down to a razor edge with this tool. This can be used to sharpen everything from axe heads down to your kitchen knives. I can vouch for this.",5,Greatest Sharpener EVER,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",0.0575

I have a few of them no skill type sharpeners like the fur ozitech or whatever its called and that doesn't work very good at all, but this sharpener works wonderfully. It is a little slower and harder to master but it allowed me to sharpen a few knives to shaving sharp, which is exactly what I wanted and couldn't do...until now. Just buy one! I bought the fine xtra-fine because I didn't want to buy 2 and I wanted to be able to shave with the knife when done sharpening. If your knife is dull it may take longer to get it to sharp but it will eventually.",5,Expensive but worth the price,1315872000,"09 13, 2011",0.2323

It has held up surprisingly well and when it gets dirty from extensive use, just wash it in the sink with dish washing liquid. I had only a basic knowledge of knife sharpening before buying this sharpener and I can now make a blade hair-popping sharp using it, no BS.",5,More durable than you would think,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",0.1779
