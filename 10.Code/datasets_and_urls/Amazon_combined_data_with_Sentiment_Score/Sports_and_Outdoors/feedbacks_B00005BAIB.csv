0,ABA0WK6OP5HFD,B00005BAIB,"[0, 0]","I have tried a few different camping mattress and this one is by far the most comfortable that I have tried. I would even rather sleep on this instead of a full blown Aerobed. I am 5' 8&#34; / 170 lbs. Not sure how this would work for anyone significantly bigger.This is ideal car camping, ie: not backing. I wouldn't want to rely on this if I am out in the woods far from civilization for several days. There is only one continuous chamber and if you spring just one leak, you would be totally out of luck. Other backpacking mattresses typically seem to have multiple chambers or some foam inside that could help get you through if there was a single leak. Have to say this one is much more comfortable though.Pros:* Very comfortable.* Not very heavy.* Blue top material feels more comfortable than straight smooth vinyl* Little built in pillow is a nice touch... although probably will still bring a small pillow to be more comfortable.* Did I say.... VERY COMFORTABLE.Cons:* No carrying case, but they never advertised it came with one so not taking a star away for that.* Takes a little while to blow up and doesn't come with any sort of pump to help. Took me about 4 minutes and getting light headed to blow it up.* Might not be suitable for extended use &#34;out in the wild&#34;.",4,Very comfortable mattress for car camping at a ridiculously low price!,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",,0.1985

4,A19W90TLTRQRQB,B00005BAIB,"[1, 1]",I'm convinced that these mattresses have the wrong type of valve. It has a small nipple and after you inflate the mattress you push in on it to retract the valve back inside of the mattress. The valve is just like the valve is on a cheap beach ball.One other thing I didn't like was the size. The add say's it's 26.5 wide but when you blow it up it's less which makes for too tiny of a mattress if you're using it for sleep instead of a water floatation raft.I had bought several of these for camping and returned them all and replaced them with the same companies ( INTEX ) extra wide mattresses. The valves on the extra wide are totally different. They're made with a hard vinyl valve that's recessed into a hard vinyl pocket. The valve is made so when you put air in it won't come out. It has a stop on the inside if the valve that's like a flap that closes when air starts to escape. To deflate you just unscrew the valve and it deflates in seconds.I would highly recommend ( anyone interested in a great quality mattress ) the INTEX extra wide. Only 6 dollars more.,2,Won't hold air because of an inferior valve,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",cookie5240,0.0907

11,AU7O296O6PXZM,B00005BAIB,"[100, 100]","As I approach middle age I've become far less enthusiastic about sleeping on the ground. In preparation for a five night camping trip, I started shopping for inflatable mattresses. The self-inflatable sleeping pads are awfully nice, but I needed more than one so this cheaper option ($11 at the time) won out.As for the mattress, it worked well and I would generally recommend it. The thick vinyl construction is noticeably better that the thin camping pads you'll find in big box stores. While any air mattress has the real potential to leak, I did not experience any leaks in five days using two new mattresses. One possible downside to the heavy construction is an air mattress that is probably too heavy for backpacking. I also agree with other reviewers that the pool float valve isn't great, but I was able to make it work (with the Coghlan's bellows pump) without major trouble.This pad should fit one average sized person reasonably well, though there is little excess room on the sides. Inflated, I measure it at almost exactly 24 x 72. This pad is probably best for back sleepers, as there isn't any extra room to roll around. I found the mattress to be much more comfortable if you inflate it to only around 70% capacity. Less air makes it less rigid, and it will better conform to your body. Though not a premium camping pad, this mattress delivers a big improvement in comfort for campers on a budget.2014 update: I paid around eleven bucks for this item, but I've noticed recently that the price has crept up. At the same time, less expensive self-inflating pads have hit the market. For about twice the money, you can now get a budget Thermarest or Alps self-inflating pad. Though I do still like this mattress, it's not quite the value it once was.",4,A good budget mattress - if you can get it at a budget price,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",ideas,0.2636

It feels like sleeping on my bed at home. It's long enough to accommodate a person who is at least 6 feet, probably more. It's only wide enough for one person. No chance in hell that you can squeeze two on this mat.The black color is actually a piece of fabric that has been glued to the mat. It's only on the top side of the mat and I'm not exactly what purpose its supposed to serve. Maybe it keeps you from sliding off?My only complaint about this mat is that it's a few ounces heavier than my old inflatable trail & stream ground pad. BUT, and this is a big but, my Intex mat is a hundred times more comfortable, so I'm more than willing to carry the extra weight in my pack.
