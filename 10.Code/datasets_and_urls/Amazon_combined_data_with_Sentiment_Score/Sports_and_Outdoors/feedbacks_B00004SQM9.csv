As a father with a young person in the house, safety is PARAMOUNT!!! The instructions were clear enough, but when I mounted the trigger lock on my rifle, there was a fair amount of give, and it was possible to work your fingers in there and get the trigger to pull. I was concerned about this, as doing so would be easier for smaller (read children's) fingers.The lock gets 3 stars because it does make pulling the trigger a lot more inconvenient, even if it isn't foolproof. The combination is programmable and the directions are clear and pretty easy to follow. At this point, keeping the upper and lower detached from each other, and storing the magazine and ammunition in two other separate places keeps the gun from being inadvertently handled or fired by my little man. Oh yeah, the threat of the most severe punishment ever given by a father to a son for handling my rifle without permission or supervision also helps.

I am a firm believer that the BEST safety is a well trained and disciplined shooter. I happen to like this product for a few specific uses. When traveling it may be good to have to have an extra layer or margin of security on the trigger. Yes, in some cases a firearm may still be fired with this on, and yes ALL locks are defeatable. BUT if the firearm in question is not going to be in a situation where an individual can fiddle with defeating this lock for a period of time it may be for you. Will it prevent theft? Probably not. Does it hinder use when in a heightened threat level, Yes. I personally like to travel with a steel lock box to stow away a loaded at-the-ready firearm. But depending on an individuals comfort and perceived threat situation this will vary. Once again, this is a personal opinion and hopefully you will take it for what it is...additional information.

After I adjusted and squeezed the two pieces together as tight as I could, I could still provide enough force to twist the unite sideways and to engage the trigger. I was trying to save money, but you can't save money if it doesn't work. The weakness is that it doesn't have pins that surround the trigger AND the trigger guard. All it has is a single &#34;rachet post&#34;.Imagine having a single post in front of your trigger (hopefully behind the trigger) that is held secure only by the pressure of the two sides squeezing together. The unit works only if you can squeeze it tight enough around the grip or the slide to hold it in place. Weak!!!The Pro Lok is an EXCELLENT lock!! (But $34) It has lighting speed access, movable pins to get infront and BEHIND the trigger, it has a key if you want, and an extra enclosed chain if you want.

At $10 a pop, not a big deal to replace it, but thought getting it off would be a problem....so I grabbed an adjustable wrench and gripped the sliding unlock lever and forced it upward. It came up without much force, and the lock came off. So if anyone is not concerned with damaging the lock, it can easily be removed.So, this is really just added safety to keep kids from hurting themselves. Still, firearm safety training is your first line of defense, and guns should be locked in a secure safe, locker, closet, etc. Do not use this as a primary deterrent.Also, regarding revolvers, Depending on the model, I would not put a round under the hammer, or in the next position and expect this lock to prevent accidental fire. And of course, with a semi-auto, if it chambered and cocked, just removing the lock could release the trigger, so probably not a good idea to use these on a loaded firearm.",3,"Keeps kids away, but can fail to unlock",1370736000,"06 9, 2013",BigToe,0.0913

38,A35PL5FRB18EAS,B00004SQM9,"[0, 0]","So, if I'm correct the whole idea of using a trigger lock is only to deter and/or make it difficult for someone to fire off a gun. If that's so, this works and does it's job.Like many other reviewers have said, no single lock will guarantee 100% safety from someone accidentally firing off a round. And before anyone gets upset at me, I agree that this lock is not a full-proof lock to prevent accidental firing, just a deterrent.It gives me a better sense of safety if anyone were to sneak into my hiding place (for the time being until I get a full-blowen gun safe cabinet) that this would give them some difficulty in fully accessing the gun. I only have 1 handgun.The construction and toughness of this lock is good. Now the spring loaded pins that supposedly keep the lock from moving around within the trigger gaurd are plastic. Which means, if someone were really creative, they could somehow shave those off and allow better access to the trigger. They wouldn't be able to fit a finger between the lock and into the trigger-gaurd, but certainly some sort of tool to get in there. Nonetheless, still would require some work to get in there.Overall, I'm happy with it. It's not crazy expensive like every other firearm accessory is, and it works well for it's purpose.

Part of this is due to my having a magazine well grip, but even without that I don't think this would be safe on that style of rifle.
