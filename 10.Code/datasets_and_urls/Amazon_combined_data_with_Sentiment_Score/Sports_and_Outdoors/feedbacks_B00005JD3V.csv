0,A270P713ORH8IC,B00005JD3V,European History Guy,"[5, 6]","This worked well enough for its first weekend camping, but it was definitely getting soft after a couple nights. I guess I've already got a small leak, somewhere.The valve doesn't quite fit snugly with our Coleman-brand air pump, so it requires at least two hands to inflate (we've got an older quick-bed, its valve fits perfectly).It's so big, it barely fits through the door of our tent. Somebody else mentioned the trampoline effect of an air mattress this big, and it's true: if one person lifts himself to roll over and then plops back down, then the other trampolines into the air. Only two very sound sleepers can sleep together on this thing. Maybe we should've gotten two twin-sized airmattresses...And the Wrap'n'Roll system is just a gimmick. Don't pay extra for it.Ben",3,Gets soft overnight...,1218499200,"08 12, 2008",0.0912
1,A1BLX5918THXTW,B00005JD3V,J. Clegg,"[0, 0]","this mattress is great. I got it for my boyfriend, who sleeps over every weekend. It is really comfortable and it holds the air. The material on the top of the mattress keeps the sheet from sliding. It is easy to blow up and to let the air out of and pack away. I recommend !!(P.S. You do have to buy a pump seperately for this mattress)",5,Great Mattress at a Great Price !!,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",0.3282

And yes, I double-checked the plug. Also removed all rocks from the sandy tent pad, used a quality tent tarp underneath a quality tent, as well, though since hadn't put any weight on either of them when they lost the air that shouldn't have mattered anyway.Did I love the carrying bags? Oh yeah. Also loved the nice new (to me) plug system which made blowing it up and sealing quickly while still full of air very easy. Too bad the part that really matters - holding air - was so immensely inadequate. Returned them immediately after returning from camping trip, now have to go find something else after having shopped for this till thought would drop...thanks Coleman...arrgghh.",1,"Stay away, stay far, far away",1279324800,"07 17, 2010",0.2081

5,A2836FIFRRUY59,B00005JD3V,ToneytheTiger,"[1, 1]","I bought this mattress about 6 weeks ago, to replace an older model of Coleman Queen-Sized air mattress that lasted 2 years, before it started to leak.Within a week, this mattress developed a slow leak - had to pump it up about once a week - I thought, Well, that's not too much trouble, but it certainly doesn't match the quality of the older model.Then, a few days ago, it developed more (or a larger) leak(s) - now, it deflates in about 4 hours - pitiful. Someone said it came with patches - mine didn't.I suggest you buy something else - I am going to - don't know which one yet.Buyer beware - the quality has went spiraling down, faster than the leak *__*",1,Do you like a leaky air mattress.........,1278028800,"07 2, 2010",-0.2615
