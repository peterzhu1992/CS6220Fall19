Lots of sliding and stomping on, throwing in and out of a support vehicle... they held up to the challenge. They are just flat and flimsy, but serve the purpose of providing bases for your game.",5,Great,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",0.1529
1,AFNG8O2DXRCUV,B00004T1JH,Amazon Customer,"[5, 7]","These pads are all rubber and roughly 1/8th inch thick. They are easy to carry inside the original box. The white color gives maximum visibility which helps when placing on grass or on a dirt field. Because it's real thin, it's better to flatten / trim tall grass to avoid bending too much.All in all it's a serviceable set of pads when playing in a park or patch of grass. But for more serious games I think it's better to look for base with more height to the pad, like real bases.",3,Serviceable,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",0.3571
2,ARXLXD4LGIW19,B00004T1JH,Cory G.,"[1, 1]","Bought these because they were relatively cheap for the whole set. After having them and using them for a year, they are beginning to deteriorate. Some are ripped and crumbling into pieces and others are severely discolored. Good for the price, but I think the weather is hard on them.",3,Good Price - Poor Durability,1355788800,"12 18, 2012",-0.0922
3,A1M0LDGMSIR3VE,B00004T1JH,Lalakers,"[1, 1]","The good is that they are thin and I can roll them up and put them in the baseball bag easily. The bad is that they are thin and move easily. Also, amazon's price was a little high as the normal price at Target was lower by a dollar and I've seem them on sale for as low as $12.",3,Good if you get a good price.,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",-0.0451

Have had them for a season and there's no obvious deterioration or ripping of the bases so far.",5,Durable,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",0.0923
5,A3FOOF7Q2GUMXX,B00004T1JH,S. Cheatham,"[0, 0]","This is a good product for the money but as the other reviews mentioned, a little thin. So I wouldn't leave them outside. Overall they are perfect for light use and we like them. Still a good value.",4,good product,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",0.4319
