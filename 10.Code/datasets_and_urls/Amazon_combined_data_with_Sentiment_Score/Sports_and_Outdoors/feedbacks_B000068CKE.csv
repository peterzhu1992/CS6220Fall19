I was in pain from riding more than a half hour at a time. Since I bought this seat, I have been able to ride much longer. It doesn't completely remove the pain from riding long distances/times, but it certainly helps. I have used it on several 50+ mile trips, and it has held up very well.",5,This is necessary,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",0.0778
1,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B000068CKE,Leanne,"[8, 9]","I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me. Right out of the packaging, this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable, but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also, the product description says that it is designed for spin bikes and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes, so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike. However, it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it, even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible. This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs, which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times, but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand.",2,Not that comfortable,1257033600,"11 1, 2009",0.1505
2,A2HTOG7TTBU5Z2,B000068CKE,S. Johnson,"[1, 1]","The first time I rode my bike with this seat cover in place, I was really pleased. It was nice and soft and the center cut-out made it much more comfortable than the flat seat pad I'd been using before. But as soon as I got off my bike after that first ride, I saw little sticky white blobs all over the cover. The gel was leaking out through the fabric. At first I didn't think it was a big deal. I told myself that maybe there was just a little excess gel in there and the leaking would stop once the extra gel had been squeezed out. But no such luck. It kept on leaking little lumps of gel every time I rode.Then I realized that the gel was not only leaking out through the fabric, it was shifting into the center cut-out. I tried taking a heavy needle and thread and stitching around the edge of the cut-out in an effort to hold the gel in place, but it didn't work. It's no longer shifting toward the center of the pad, but it's shifting everywhere else in every direction, creating uncomfortable bumps and bulges. I've barely had the seat cover a month, and it's a bedraggled lumpy mess.So if you're considering buying this, I have one word of advice: don't.",1,"Gel leaks, doesn't stay in place",1372118400,"06 25, 2013",-0.0063
3,A300GUSDAHJL9P,B000068CKE,tekwiz47,"[1, 1]",yeah this will work to help soften the seat especially if you are a intermittent to casual rider and do not ride enough to get toughened against the seat for those longer rides like maybe when you were a little younger or didn't have some form of arthritis to deal with as an example.There are several of these types of cushions around from other companies and in different materials but Schwinn has been around awhile and this is gel instead of memory foam.,5,soft,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",0.5647

After reading some of the other reviews, I had some doubt about purchasing this item. A lot of people were talking about outdoor bikes and spin bikes, and how the cover did not fit. I have a Schwinn Stationery bike, so I thought maybe it would fit because it was a different type of bike. Wrong answer, the width of the cover is not wide enough and the length is not long enough. I was very disappointed. I am just going to detach my seat and take it to a bike shop where I can purchase the right seat cover for it.",2,Okay Product,1319932800,"10 30, 2011",-0.084
