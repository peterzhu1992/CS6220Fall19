Perhaps should have gone with a medium instead, as I use it to bring back a quick edge when away from home but it works great as is.",5,Great option,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",0.5829
1,AS2II0671KT2C,B00004WFT6,David Crowder computer geek,"[0, 0]",This works really well and is perfect for my smaller 'emergency' bag. Definetly would recommend it for its size and usability,5,Mini-sharpener,1357084800,"01 2, 2013",0.4513
2,A29MD9Z3KVIP4K,B00004WFT6,JimBow jp_bowhunter,"[0, 0]","I got this to keep in my day pack while hunting, The size is perfect, it folds flat and takes no space but when it is open it is large enough to sharpen my any of my knives easily, My everyday clip knife gets abused, and I was able to quickly get it back to a sharp edge in short order with this. A lightweight American made product that sharpens knives well, it will be in my day pack all the time now. A must have for western elk hunters quartering up an elk.",5,Handy sharperner that works,1371513600,"06 18, 2013",0.04
3,ACRMQUNZFVQ3Y,B00004WFT6,Joseph E.,"[0, 0]","I bought a couple of these in different grits. They are really handy for keeping a keen edge on a working blade. My family is in construction, and I'm the only one who seems interested in doing much if any knife maintenance. I got this for my brother though so I don't have to resharpen the knives he uses as often, and it let's him keep safe sharp knives instead of dangerous dull ones. I may have to get a few more for other family members and then I might only have to sharpen my own knives.",5,great tool!,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",0.0645
4,A1GPG0YXH9QD9S,B00004WFT6,joshnstuff,"[0, 0]","This shines as sort of an EDC type sharpener for Smaller blades.Great for your pocket knife, or neck knife. Its pretty short, so it difficult to get a lot of purchaseon your blade with anything larger, though I guess it could be done if you really tried.Originally got this to test as part of a minimalist kit for use as my sharpener.....I decided there weredefinitely better options for that.This is one of those purchases that ended up totally working out, just not how I thought, as this thing is always with mein my day to day routine.",4,Nice little sharpener for the keychain,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",0.2571
5,A2V6GYU7T73OK8,B00004WFT6,Manuel D. Lopez Carpenter,"[2, 2]","Great sharpener, I keep it in my toolbox for work, saves my razor knife blades. Works great on my pocket knifes too, as I use both types, at work. Buy this item, and you'll be very pleased.",5,Manny,1242432000,"05 16, 2009",0.5808
6,A27YSYBR6HQMMB,B00004WFT6,nervusnorvus,"[2, 5]","This is the little brother of the DMT diafold. Very light and small. I keep one on my keychain. The extended length when open, is an aid to keeping a constant angle. I have never had one come apart but I suspect they are not as durable as the diafold and are not available two sided (two different grits) which of course, would be heavier. Mine seem to be rust resistant for use with water to wash away metal dust which would otherwise accumulate on the surface. These Mini Sharps are not for any work heavier than edge maintenance.UPDATE 9/7/2012:-- The molded-on flanges of the plastic handle broke off when I tried to unfold my Mini-Sharp. No more than normal force was applied. It is now in two pieces. I want an item like this to be dependable. Lowering my rating to one star.",1,Very Portable but Fragile Sharpener,1308960000,"06 25, 2011",-0.088

I thought they were sharp until I tried this diamond sharpener. All I can say is WOW! It gets a very fine and sharp edge on any blade.

I played with it a bit after I got it, then packed it away in a travel box and that is where it lives.. Lucky for me I have not needed for it to work, but I think it will if I need it....",5,I have it,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",0.1909
