29,A2IFY6958MRGEM,7245456313,D. Deutsch Chance favors the prepared mind.,"[1, 1]","I bought this set of bands to work on rehabbing my knee outside of the gym. This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer. Hopefully, I am not overstating the obvious, but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights.",4,takes some getting used to,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",0.2939

But now that they changed to standard carabineers instead, I decided to buy a second set, which I use more regularly.

I would say the only drawback may be is that the bands, all bands not just the two mentioned, are a little short for some people, and probably best suited for people in the 5'4 to 5'9 range. I'm not saying people below and above that range shouldn't get a set. Let me just make it clear the height range I gave is not a concrete standard. It's just an opinion as to how I feel.

The strap is then inserted between the door jamb and the door and is secured in place when you close the door.

I purchase these instead of the company's $30 price for only 1 resistance band (aka tube).

97,APS831ZLF95PS,7245456313,Thomas,"[0, 0]","We purchased two sets of these bands for use with P90X. We have completed one full cycle of P90X and part of a second cycle, although we eventually switched to weights for most of the program. We continued to use these bands for pull-upsThe Good:These bands are easy to use, and being able to clip multiple bands onto the handles is helpful. Some people may need more weight than this set can provide. Since my wife did not use the &#34;heaviest&#34; red band very often, I borrowed hers to make my simulate pull-ups more challenging.The door strap works well near a hinge, and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar. Overall they have held up fairly well.The Bad:Out of our two sets, one strap broke at the metal clasp. I expected one of the rubber tubes to give out, but instead the metal snapped where the clip swivels around on the post that attaches to the band. Fortunately no one was hurt when it went, but it left a mark on the top of the door frame when it went during a pull-up.Some of the bands show a lot of wear from friction when standing on the band to shorten it or to increase tension, as the P90X videos demonstrate. Again, none of them have snapped, but we stopped using one of the black bands just in case.Overall:I liked the bands to get started on P90X, but ultimately decided they weren't giving me the workout I wanted. As soon as I switched to some &#34;dial weights&#34; I felt I was getting a better workout. The weight ratings on these bands did not match up with using actual weights at all. In theory, if I was lifting 20 lbs according to the band tension rating, I needed to back down to 10-15 pounds on the free weights.Still, we were not disappointed in our purchase of these bands. They are a good value and we are pleased to own and continue to use them.",4,"Good, but not great",1376956800,"08 20, 2013",0.1808

104,A3TBMAWIIHKHFN,7245456313,Willie V. Hughes,"[200, 242]","I love this set of exercise bands. I purchased them on a recommendation from my personal trainer for use when I stay at hotels without a full gym. Any hotel room with a door will allow me to do 90% of the exercises I normally do. All these bands roll up into a nice bag for travel and the whole kit is fairly lightweight.I think the lighter gauge bands are pretty useless for strength training unless you are a petite woman, child, or doing some rehabilitative work. I'm not exactly sure who uses a 2lb band. Maybe for stretching? But the red and black bands are heavier gauge and excellent for male strength training.There are a lot of reviews here on Amazon complaining that the bands eventually wear-out or break. They are supposed to. They stretch and, after repeated stretching, yes, they will wear out. Good. That means you are using them and your muscles are getting a workout. Quit whining. Buy a few more replacement bands. Wear them out too.The company that makes these bands appears pretty solid. In the package I received, there was a coupon for a free extra orange band which was even a heavier gauge than the black band. I'm looking forward to receiving it, and I think the company offering it at no charge was a very nice touch.",5,Excellent bands for travel,1336694400,"05 11, 2012",0.2619
