Great fuel economy out of the propane bottles. This model does not have an ignition on it, so you will need a lighter or match. No biggie, i always have a lighter or match when taking this camping. I would recommend this stove for anybody who's camping or needs it for emergency situations.",5,great stove,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",0.1326

The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska, Canada's wild lakes (for canoe and kayak camping) and on our average family summer camping vacations.It is lightweight, sturdy and a great way to prepare hot cakes, eggs and coffee in the morning.For larger families, there are of course larger Coleman stoves.

The stove gets very hot, and is great for boiling water.The stove does not do 'simmer' particularly well. Be careful with anything that needs lower heat settings. Using a cast iron pan or high quality aluminum or copper clad pan helps. Attempting pancakes, eggs or a side dish requires very close attention.I would say that overall this is a good value, but there are better units available.It does have good wind resistance to it, which is a definite plus outside.",3,Convenient and Hot,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",0.4356
3,A2C27IQUH9N1Z,B00005OU9D,audrey,"[5, 6]","Setting up a new camping outfit, we got a new tent, air mattress, lantern and camping stove, all Coleman. The tent and air mattress: great! The lantern: terrific! The stove: not too good.We did not have the problem that many others seem to have had; namely, an aluminum tray that catches and is not secured to the base properly. And, as with older models, the design is a winner -- adjustable wind flaps, and folding and carrying that are well-thought out (as long as you are able to carry the portable propane tanks separately).BUT, the raison d'etre of a stove is .... HEATING. You cannot control the flame on this thing. No matter how precisely you adjust the flame, no matter how carefully you remove your hand from the knob, the flame immediately goes to high. It would be more accurate to have an on/off switch instead of a knob. This was okay when we wanted to boil water, but trying to actually cook was not at all pleasant. This was true on both burners.Coleman should be ashamed. Is this the start of the demise of the Coleman reputation? Surely the company knew about this before these went out to the public. I won't be so quick to assume a Coleman product is good quality anymore. Of all the things to get wrong! You wouldn't think a stove's heating capabilities would be considered optional by the manufacturer.I thought about exchanging this item, but the number of reviewers making the same complaint indicates a return is more in order. Our next stove will not be Coleman.",2,a stove should do one thing well -- heat things up,1347667200,"09 15, 2012",0.1054

It's only problem is that the diameter of the burners is too small, you can't use 12 pots, and it doesn't have enough BTU's to boil water fast. Listen, if space is not an issue, get the Coleman 2 Burner Powerpack Stove. It's a couple of dollars more than this stove. It's quite a bit larger than this stove, and it's as nice as cooking on a gas stovetop at home. You can boil tons of water quick, saute calamari or scallops while you're camping if you're so inclined, or make pancakes for a mob of people on your Lodge Reversable Grill/Griddle.

You can hook in a single propane cylinder tank that gives you 45 to 60 minutes on HIGH depending on your atmospheric conditions. This is a Coleman PerfectFlow stove that allows regulation of the propane pressure so some use and experimentation will get you desired results. It is a small unit, but it is very versatile and well-crafted. This Coleman stove has adjustable sides that allow for larger cookware and/or use to control temperature.

My friend had the Coleman model with the knobs on either end (as opposed to side by side with this one), and it worked great.

It is simple to set up and use, and there is enough space to fit two decent sized pots next to each other. Unfortunately like others mentioned the temperature control is lacking which is my biggest complaint.Pros:-Easy to set up and use-Easy to find refill canisters-Packs small-Boils water quicklyCons:-Temperature control is poor, its impossible to simmer. It takes some practice finishing both meals at the same time and keeping everything warm-Quality, I suspect some of the rivets may break. I think there is a difference between light weight and cheap and this item is right on the lineConclusion: This stove is certainly not perfect but it serves a very utilitarian purpose. I don't think you could cook gourmet meals with this stove but you can certainly make eggs and bacon or pasta with sauteed vegetables. I would recommend this product to others however I would caution them that it isn't the same as their stove at home, which in some ways adds to the fun of camping.Note: I found I needed a case to keep the propane cylinders from rolling around the car and to keep everything together, I purchased theColeman Stove Carry Case, I'll let you know how it fits after it arrives and I actually get to field test it some.",4,Useful but not perfect.,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",0.2263
