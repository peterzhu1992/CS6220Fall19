0,A3A1OA237FOZFK,B00004YVAJ,#1 Amazon Fan,"[0, 0]","I have had one of these on my key chain for over 15 years now; it's only been replaced 3 times and I use it almost daily. It comes with a removable plastic toothpick and tweezers. I love having a toothpick handy after eating out somewhere and the tweezers work very well. The tweezers do not have the strongest grip because they are very thin and therefore a bit flexible, but I have never had them fail to work and they have very sharp edges for getting out the finest hair and/or splinter.The knife and fingernail file/screwdriver are obviously useful in many instances; the only problem I've ever had is that if you are trying to remove/loosen a very tight screw it might close on you if you press too hard. The implements do not 'lock' into place, so you have to use some caution.The scissors were originally my primary reason for purchasing these and are fine enough to help trim your cuticles and strong enough for smaller cuts. They are definitely not super strong but definitely cut paper and thin plastic easily.Overall, these are a terrific gift for just about anyone and a great purchase for yourself. I've seen them in the store for upwards of $14 but you can get these for less frequently on sale at Amazon.",5,Great Gift & Awesome Every Day Tool for Yourself,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",0.4203

Still, there is a reason why this is a &#34;classic&#34;! You won't be disappointed with this small keychain knife. I would suggest adding an extra keyring so the knife sits flush with your keys.

2,A1HRYC60VTMYC0,B00004YVAJ,Ace,"[1, 1]","I have had and used a Swiss army Knife for almost 40 years. They are wonderful -- I still have and proudly use the one I bought 35 yrs ago -- it's in fine condition (well, the scissors spring is another story...)And for FOURTEEN years I carried a little Swiss Army Knife in my pocket -- the little blade so sharp that even after 14 yrs I could stil slit open boxes and take them apart with this small but mighty vorpal sword. No matter that the scissors spring broke - that has happened on all of mine, and the scissors always worked, with or without spring -- but the rest of the knife stayed intact -- the toothpick rescuing me from awkward situations and the tweezer plucking an errant eyebrow, holding a small part like a mini vise, or rescuing the cotton ball in my ears that sometimes decided that it wanted to meet the other cotton ball halfway (kids, don't try this at home!)I rarely use the lttle screwdriver/file combo, but when I do, it delivers. I like to hold the plastic body of the knife and the bottom edge of the screwdriver at the same time while I am torquing up some screws as I feel that this way I will be delivering an equal amount of energy to a bigger area of the whole unit, thus putting less of a strain on the screwdriver blade.I loved mini-knife #1 -- and almost lost it a number if times, but this time, alas, it is gone..... and I can only hope someone found it and will cherish it as much as I did. How did I lose it? I bought a pair of pants from (NOT Amazon) .... and they were so horrible that the pockets literally tried to regurgitate their contents. I no longer wear those pants, as I almost lost my work ID and bus pass too.Yes I will always miss Mini-Knife #1, and am sad that my faithful friend is gone but I am so happy that I was able to get a replacement - Long Live Swiss Army Knives!!!",5,Loved....and then...LOST!!

Sound like a good deal on a multi tool that is that thin and small to begin with?Honest, I was about to order one. How cool would it be to have a larger Alox tool AND it's little brother? How cute would that be if they matched?! But, then I thought about how not having the extra few tools would stink, added to the fact that the classic SD is already super tiny to begin with. So tiny, it literally will disappear if misplaced.. It just didn't make any sense to me.My guess is that if you have an Alox style companion to this, you might want it. But I do, and I don't want it for the reasons listed. It simply doesn't add any value when you lose tools on an already super slim product. You're paying more for less, essentially. I don't like throwing money away, so I'll stick with my classic SD cellidor scales for now. My honest opinion of course.

I realize there is a size listed in the description, but honestly, who really expects a Swiss Army Knife to be so small the blade is nearly microscopic? I'm not even sure what task you could actually accomplish with this toy - maybe opening a letter? I got this, intending to give it to my 9-year-old on a father-son camping trip, as a sort of right-of-passage on his journey to becoming a man. Somehow, I don't think it will have quite the impact I was hoping for, given that I lose the knife in my own hand, it's so small.Again, I know there is a description that gives 2 1/4&#34; as a length, but seriously, nobody needs a knife this small.

35,A30J7WQV0ZNRXG,B00004YVAJ,D. Reinstein marindavid,"[151, 153]","For many years now, I have carried one of these small Swiss Army knives on each of my two key rings - one for work and one for home. Barely a day goes by when I do not take one of them out of my pocket to use once or twice - to quickly file down a broken nail, to tweeze out a small splinter, to cut open a small item with the scissor of something larger by cutting the wrapping tape with the knife blade - the toothpick is used daily! I cannot imagine being without one. Of course, I own larger and more multi-purpose knives, but when it comes to carrying something this handy on a key chain or ring, you just can't beat them!There are two major (authorized) manufacturers of Swiss Army knives: Victorinox, the maker of this particular favorite of mine and Wenger, a reliable alternative brand that makes many similar and some even nearly identical models. I have used both over the years and have found there to be absolutely no appreciable differences in the quality, durability or pricing of the knives. With so many models to choose from, it probably makes sense to decide which features you need and then shop both brands for the best price you can find. But back to the knife at hand, the SA Classic SD Pocket Knife.This is the one of the smallest knives in the Victorinox line. Measuring only about 2 1/4 long and about 1/4 wide, it adds little by way of heft to a key ring. It is a compact knife containing a total of 6 equally compact tools. This is not for the big things. This is a small knife with small tools to deal with small things. With expectations appropriately set, it is unsurpassed in it's usefulness as a basic daily tool.The ToolsThere are compartments on the outer casing of knife - each containing a small appliance. One is home to a small white toothpick that I have found to be entirely satisfactory - except that after a year or two of use, I seem to lose them. I think the molded shape wears a bit over time and repeated use and no longer holds itself snugly in the allotted compartment. They can be easily and inexpensively replaced though at any fully stocked retailer of the knives. On the opposite side of the knife is a compartment housing a micro-tweezer. Because it is so very small and light, it cannot be used as a regular tweezer, but only for light-duty needs. These include, I am pleased to report, removing small splinters and picking up objects too small for my increasingly clumsy fingers!There are three tools that fold into the knife itself, one of which has two uses - actually providing a total of four useful mini-tools. These include 1) a flat spring loaded scissor, a regular blade and a nail file (which, as a guitar picker, I use almost daily) topped with the fourth tool, a screw driver head, small enough to be used for either flat screws or Phillips head screws - providing that they are small enough. Don't misunderstand - the smallness of the tools does not render them either token or useless, but their size is a factor in their usability in real day-to-day life.MaintenanceThis is nearly a non sequitor, but in the interests of completeness, I will briefly address it.Years have gone by before anything beyond simple removal of dust and cleaning the instruments is required. One time, a blade seemed to be sticking just a tad and a quick and very short burst of WD40 took care of it - permanently. The knife is build to last until you decide you no longer want or need it.ValueThere are few things in life built for frequent use without planned obsolescence being figured into their design. This little pocket tool set is, happily, among them. For somewhere around $9., you can have something actually skillfully made that will serve you well and for a good long time. How many things can any of us really say that about?I love mine and would feel not only unprepared, but somehow naked - or at least disabled - were I to leave home without one.",5,I Would Feel Unprepared For My Day Without It!,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",0.1345

It is what every young kid strived for when then were young and for good reason, it is useful, compact and lightweight, and affordable. This triple threat makes the Victorinox Classic a truly useful blade.The blade itself came to me legitamately SHAVING sharp. It will pass the paper cut test with flying colors and will hold an edge for a fairly decent amount of time. I have had mine for a number of months and it still continues to shave. However, keep in mind, my use has been limited and only for small tasks. After all, this knife is TINY. That being said, we must choose realistic jobs for this knife, such as opening mail and small boxes, opening packaging, and cutting that stray strand of string hanging off your t-shirt. The 420 stainless steel blade still will dull, but its easy enough to sharpen with a wetstone or ceramic rod.Next, we need to look at an excellent nail file and screwdriver combination. The file itself works well, not being too gritty as to hurt your finger and not being too soft as to not serve a purpose. It finds that happy medium of comfort and effectivness. The screwdriver tip proves most handy. I actually used this screwdriver on a Phillips that fell out of the inside trim of my truck. Its a '95 F150, so its old and the entire side panel on the door fell off. I located the screw on the ground and inserted it back into the hole and screwed it back in with ease. I would not recomend really putting too much strain on a job like this, but it will offer a temporary solution to an unexpected issue. This tool leaves you prepared!The scissors are also a handy item included with this knife. They are extremely sharp and will precisely chew through paper and other managable materials. Once again, this is small tool that can do SMALL, everyday jobs. Do not try to cut through a chained link fence with this thing. Choose your battles wisely.Like most Victorinox Swiss Amry Knives, this tool includes the reliable and famous tweezers and toothpick. The tweezers are of high quality but do not have precision accuracy as seen with other more expensive pairs of tweezes. But with practice, you'll be able to master the art of splinter removal. The toothpick is essential for those nights out at the restaurant after a nice steak consummution, leaving stringing remains in your bicuspids. This thing will dig 'em out no problem.Overall, this Classic is excellent for a keychain edc knife. Sure, the handles will get beat up and scratched but it only gives the knife more character. Over the past few months I have felt reliant on this handy micro tool and do not plan on removing it from my EDC (everyday carry). The tools are of the reknowned Victorinox quality and will withstand the test of time.

82,A1T5LTP095T18L,B00004YVAJ,Leon Pantenburg,"[3, 3]","Elk Lake, Oregon is one of the major re-supply places for hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail. Every year, a handful of through hikers will attempt to walk border-to-border on the trail. They generally start in Mexico in April, and start trickling in to the Elk Lake Resort about August. They need to get to the Canadian border before the snow flies.I was eating lunch at the resort two years ago, and noticed a young lady trekker at a picnic table. She was loading her pack for the next section. She had opened her re-supply box, sliced a chunk of cheese, opened several large packages and cut a shoelace, all with her tiny, Classic Swiss Army knife.The Classic had been her only knife for nearly three months on the trail.It's all you need, she commented. I have to go lightweight and I don't carry an ounce that isn't needed.For lightweight hikers, who go long distances with minimal equipment, a Classic may be a reasonable choice. On a trail like the Pacific Crest or Appalachian, you'll seldom be isolated from other hikers for very long if you need help.If you're out on a dayhike with a large group of well-prepared hikers, you may not use a knife at all. But (DANGER!!! DANGER!!! SURVIVAL COMMON SENSE ALERT!!!) that doesn't mean you don't need a knife.Get separated from the group, off the beaten path in the backcountry, or in some sort of wilderness survival situation and you may desperately need a real survival knife.Calling a Classic a survival knife is quite a stretch, and I'd never carry that knife as my only survival tool. But it doesn't matter where I am, or what I'm doing, if it is legal, I have a Classic with me.In most areas, it is socially unacceptable to wear a sheath survival knife with your dress or business suit. But at 2-1/2 inches long, a Classic is virtually un-noticeable. (Don't try to take one on an airplane or into a courthouse ! The Classic does show up on metal detectors!)If an emergency develops in an urban, business office environment, maybe all you'll have are the survival tools on you. And I'd much rather have atiny knife, than no knife at all. A Classic can be an important part of your survival gear.Here's what you get with a Classic:The best tweezers in the world: The value of this is easily seen when you get a sliver in your finger gathering firewood. If you go outdoors with kids, this feature alone makes the knife worth owning!Toothpick: Removes annoying food debris from your teeth.Scissors: Great for cutting anything. I've used mine at weddings, in the office, on campouts and for trimming unruly facial hairs. I've used the tiny scissors to cut bicycle tubes, Moleskin, ribbons on packages, duct tape and bandages.Blade: The 1-1/2 inch blade can be sharpened easily, and cuts well for its size and design. In an emergency, the tiny blade will probably work much better than a sharp piece of glass, broken beer bottle, or jagged rock cutting tool that you have to improvise.Fingernail File: For a survival situation manicure? Actually, tear the corner of a fingernail in the backcountry and you'll be really glad you have some way of filing off that jagged edge!Low cost: A Classic is cheap. In Hawaii, I bought a Classic for $12 and used it for a week. I presented it to the baggage handler as we boarded the plane for the mainland. At one post-Christmas sale at a major department store, Classics were going for $3 each. I bought all they had. Watch for sales and you can get really good deals. Classics make great gifts, and could be a great prepper barter item.Here's a tip to add one more tool. Take a Dremel tool and grind the end of the file so it fits the hinge screw of your glasses. Nobody ever has a glasses screwdriver when you need one!Outdoors, depending on the terrain and activity, I may take several different knives that are used for special tasks. As an overall survival and big game hunting knife, I use a Cold Steel SRK.For upland and small game hunting and cleaning fish; camp chores such as whittling wiener sticks, spreading peanut butter, peeling potatoes and chopping onions, and other mundane tasks, I generally carry a Frost Mora knife.For everyday carry, either in my pocket or a belt pouch, I prefer a thin, two-layer thickness knife with multiple tools, such as a Swiss Army Tinker.Occasionally, I'll take along a multi-tool. My favorite over the last ten years has proven to be the Leatherman Wave.When it comes to weight, the Classic is the lightweight champ, tipping the postal scales at one ounce. The Swiss Army Tinker weighs 2.5 ounces; a Frost Mora also weighs about 2.5 ounces (5 ounces with the six feet of duct tape wrapped around the sheath) and the SRK is 8 ounces, with 2.5 ounces of duct tape on the sheath.Carry a Classic in addition to any of these larger knives, and you have an effective multi-tool set. In and of itself, the Classic is an inadequate survival knife. But combined with a larger knife, the knife will prove to be worth its weight in gold.So get a Classic and add it to your survival or prepping gear. As happened to me, you'll go from wondering what good the dinky little knife could be, to wondering how you got along without it.(Leon Pantenburg is the author of SurvivalCommonSense.com and an avid outdoorsman.)",5,Survival Knife Review: The Swiss Army Knife Classic?,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",0.0567
83,A1R4830GBU8UIM,B00004YVAJ,LgT,"[0, 0]","I have the Victorinox Classic SD in both the alox and plastic scales. It goes without saying that both knives offer a useful assortment of tools and high build quality in a very small and lightweight package. The question is which version should you buy, and I will list the advantages of each model below, based on my experience.Alox version:* Scales are more durable and will not scratch or crack* Solid scales means the knife is easier to clean and dry off* Slightly lighter and slimmer, will fit into tighter spacePlastic version:* Has toothpick and tweezers* Smooth scales have better traction* Wider handle provides a better grip and more control of the knife while cutting* Doesn't make as much noise when bumping against other items on the keychain* Is typically cheaperThe verdict:Plastic version is the winner. The wider, smoother handle provides a noticeably better control and grip of the knife in tasks that are more demanding than opening envelopes - for example, peeling and cutting an apple (yes, the little blade can do it). It gets scratched against keys, but it's no big deal, and I haven't had one crack on me yet.I also have the Victorinox Rambler, and that one offers several advantages over the Classic - mainly the extra tool and a key ring positioned at the opposite side of the blade.

This 2 1/4 inch all-purpose tool is always on my key ring, and is useful for about 70 or 80% of those cases where you need some sort of tool but the tool box is inaccessible.This gem has a tooth pick, a pair of tweezers, a sharp knife, a nail file, a screwdriver formed on the end of the nail file, and a pair of scissors. I have probably used the knife and the scissors more than any other tools.The knife and the tweezers are useful for splinters and thorns, and thus the tweezers often become the third most useful tool. I must admit that occasionally I use the toothpick, particularly when real toothpicks are not available.The screwdriver is small enough that it can also fit into a Phillips head screw. I have even been able to use the flat blade on some small hex head screws.The difficulty with carrying tools is that they can fill your pocket very quickly. This small Swiss Army knife is small enough to fit into a purse or a pocket and yet large enough to be useful. While the larger Swiss Army knives have even more and larger tools and blades, they are also harder to carry. Of course this particular knife will not replace a tool box, but I find it amazing how many tasks I can accomplish with the simple tools available in this gem.",5,"If you are going to carry a pocket knife, this is it",1127952000,"09 29, 2005",0.3319

129,A2N8APC0G9M3QM,B00004YVAJ,The Mountaineer,"[0, 0]","I'll never forget the first time I saw a Victorinox knife,my grandmother kept one in her purse and I always asked if I could see it...as a kid I thought it was the neatest thing in the world.Moving on when I got older I turned to multi-tools:they were more compact,sturdy stainless steel,and they were more comfortable to carry than a thick Swiss Army Knife loaded with everything but the kitchen sink(and pliers).But to the patient individual who can carry an SAK in their pocket everyday I can only say it's level of handyness really depends on what you get...but let's get to the classic SD.So what's so great about the SD model?it's nice to have something useful on your keychain and this knife is it!Think about it:the knife is only two layers so it's reasonably thin.Doesn't weight much so it's not a bother on your keychain.And don't forget the tools...for something this size efficient and useful your keyring is practically naked without it.Being that the SD is smaller in size it's more for light-duty tasks or uses where intricate use is involved and though it doesn't seem like much you'll find it to be handy when you least expect it.Take the tools for instance...*Scissors:Now and then I'll get behind on cutting my fingernails and mine have a tedency to grow fast,I deal with the public alot as a technician so appearance is important.I just whip these little scissors out on the way to a service call(not while driving) and since their small they do make nice and small clips more in tune with a nail clipper...a real timesaver.Using them for cutting things?well you can but you've also got the knife.*File/Small Slotted Screwdriver:As a guy I don't really file my nails as a routine function but I do work with my hands alot and my nails get chipped or torn,I can deal with that except when they snag on your pants pocket,your work shirt,or heck even a blanket in bed... then it's annoying.But the file's right there and it does the trick so I'm not ragging on guys who file their nails but it's nice to have the file on a 'as needed' basis.The small slotted screwdriver gets an odd use for me-I use it to get out the lint that collects in my fans during the summer.Or when I'm cleaning one of the service vehicles and there's cigarette ash or dried out soda that collected in those little gaps in the consoles...that tip really helps get it out.*Toothpick/Tweezers:As you might have guessed they serve their simple purpose and there is the most common flaw...the toothpick is proned to fall out.The only thing I can mention to you for preventing that is don't force the toothpick into it's slot,there's is a machined notch on the plastic surface that secures the toothpick and by shoving it in your'e wearing down that notch.Beyond that the two implements serve their purpose.*The Knife:It's a reasonably sharp and thin blade and of course it's cheap versus a dedicated knife...but it comes handy in a pinch.I usually never forget my personal carry knife so this little blade gets seldom use but after years of owning my first SD it finally needed a light sharpening...two or three passes on a stone and it was sharp again...gotta love soft steel.So that wraps it up on the tools with only one word of advice:use rubbing alcohol and wipe down the tools you use for sanitary reasons then wipe off the alcohol and dry.The tools are polished stainless and fight off rust quite well but wipe the alcohol completely from the tools...if it sits on the steel for extended periods of time it will eat into the finish.The Handles:Plastics can do two things for a consumer-they can win someone over and prove their worth or they can break and dissapoint someone...Victorinox just uses a basic plastic and nothing specialized like delrin or zytel for the handle scales.But I've tossed my keys on the kitchen table countless times and I've dropped my keys on concrete a good share of times and both my old SD and my new one have never cracked or shattered,only scratches.The handle colors have changed over the years,first time I bought one they were only available in Red or Black and the colors seem to vary throughout the years...my new one was in Forest Green(seems discontinued in that color).Final Thoughts:I'm sure many other reviewers have said this but it is the most handy thing in a compact form on your keyring-it doesn't take up space and it's truthfully useful.The tool selection may seem limited to some but I think for it's size the Victorinox Classic SD brings alot to the table...5-stars!*File:",5,Just Plain Out Handy!,1359763200,"02 2, 2013",0.5911

I've been using full-size Victorinox knives for over 20 years since I was a cub scout, and it's hard to beat those for general purpose work. However, they are a bit on the large and heavy side for carrying with keys- typically I leave it in the glove compartment or tackle box these days. The Classic SD is tiny, light, and slim. There's other versions of this knife that add a few more tools and even an LED light, but I still prefer this one for sheer simplicity. The small knife blade is ideal for opening boxes and letters, and the scissors are great for fine work- you can even cut your nails or trim nose hairs with them. Most of the larger Victorinox knives, if I were to be perfectly honest, have at least a few tools I never use. This one doesn't. There's a reason this knife has been selling, essentially unchanged, for decades.Furthermore, and perhaps the best part of it- this knife is available in a TON of different colors, patterns, and handle styles. No matter who you are, there's definitely one for you. In my case, I have the one with the BSA emblem because I like to remember my years in the Scouts. My wife has a cutesy floral pink one... to each their own.About the only problem with this knife isn't really a problem with it- and that is you have to make sure you take it off your keychain if you go through a security checkpoint. They still don't like these and are liable to confiscate it. This has given rise to a bunch of keychain multitools that don't have blades in an attempt to bypass these restrictions; I've used a few of them but honestly they just aren't a substitute. The penknife and scissors are just too darn useful to have around.The good news in even that regard is that these knives are also very affordable. You can get them for under $10 in many places, and I've even had some given freely as souvenirs or favors.
