If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night (I guess folks do that) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light. Essentially, this will do. The Bell light makes light and flashes. I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road. It is fairly cheap construction, but it shouldn't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work. The light is inexpensive and it works. If you are concerned with batteries and the environment, buy a generator light... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one.",4,"If you are not a gear geek, this will do the job.",1245888000,"06 25, 2009",0.0651
2,A37SFXAWN1CXO0,B00005BXUU,Doug Danzeisen frankfan42,"[1, 1]","Item arrived quickly. This was a gift purchase- have two other sets. Headlamp has four settings a bright and a dimmer incandescent setting, as well as two settings for the two leds, one constantly on and one blinking. The bright incandescent setting provides good lighting for night rides, but is not to be mistaken for one of the expensive headlamps which light up the roadway. Batts are 4 AA and they last approx an hour on the brightest setting with rechargables and then defaults to the LED continuously on setting. This setting stays on for over 24 hours. Provides enough light to see your way home, as well as being seen.Tail lamp uses AAA batts and has multiple settings for constant on as well as different blink modes. Only flaw is that the tail lamp assembly can work loose in the housing, particularly if you have a seat pack. That said a piece of tape keeps it from coming out. Battery life is great, still on the original set after many night rides. Light is bright and shows up well.Can't beat this set for the price. Alkaline batts seem to last longer, I carry a spare set.",4,Works well -Great value for the money,1198886400,"12 29, 2007",0.3091

My only concern was when the tensioning required to keep the front lamp handlebar mount broke the clamp, I discovered the clamp is not sold separately I had to buy the entire set in order to replace it.",4,"I use this when its dawn or dusk and as recommended by Bell, I don't ride at night.",1382572800,"10 24, 2013",-0.0217

Stuckey kateling,"[0, 0]","I rarely ride at night but there have been a couple of bicycle/vehicle accidents in my town recently and I figured a little visibility is worth 15 bucks if it prevents me from an accident. The directions are not very detailed and it took me a few minutes to figure out how to install the batteries (4-AA for the head lamp and 2-AAA for the tail light). They both work great, both have multiple functions to suit the type of riding you are doing. It took some finagling to get the head lamp mounted because of the front reflector and mySchwinn 17-Function Bike Computer. I was a little disappointed in the back light for two reasons: (1) myTopeak Explorer Bike Rackhas a mounting plate for a light, but this one comes with a seat-post mount and (2) the tab you push down to release the light from the bracket broke the first time I tried to separate the pieces. So now I have no mount and a tail light I can't attach to my bike (yet). A great concept set though and I would still buy it again!",4,"flimsy mounts, but otherwise great lights",1274572800,"05 23, 2010",-0.0548

7,A33ZYFE8XMKKR1,B00005BXUU,P. Scott Pope Scott Pope,"[15, 18]","For the price, this light is hard to beat. Over the years, I have used approximately twenty different bicycle lights by brands such as Cateye, Cygolite and Planet Bike. While some of these were significantly better than the Bell, they were also three to ten times as expensive. If you don't mind the large mass of four AA batteries on your handlebars and have under twenty dollars to spend, the Bell Night Trail bicycle light is the way to go.The real downside to having the batteries in the enclosure is the hazard created when the housing becomes dislodged during an impact. While this has not happened with the Bell light, it did occur with a Planet Bike light while riding through traffic in NYC. The distraction was extremely dangerous. Losing half of the batteries was not fun either.Fortunately, the Bell light has a sturdy enclosure where the top half slides backwards to open. This makes it almost impervious to front and vertical impacts. However, the internal latches never quite give you a clear indication that it is closed. Rather, you must squeeze the top downward and push forward simultaneously until you can't move it further.Much like the headlight, the taillight compares well to more expensive lights. Similar to competing products, it has various blinking modes as a well as an always-on setting. Due to the design of the lens, light escapes from the sides and top of the light. Such side lighting is crucial for riding in urban areas.The build quality is good but not on par with the $100+ lighting systems. But again, the selling point of this light is overall value. Some of the nicer features include a bright Xenon bulb paired with miserly LED lights that can blink for hours. Unlike some of the MR11-based bulbs (parabolic track lighting bulbs), the lens assembly has two ports on the right and left sides. This spreads light perpendicularly to the path of travel, which is a nice feature when in traffic. These features combined with a very modest price make this light an excellent choice for the budget conscious.ProsValueBrightnessCombination of LED and Xenon modesDecent build qualitySide lighting on headlightConsQuestionable design of battery compartment (top half of headlight)BulkyLEDs could be brighter",4,Excellent Value,1163203200,"11 11, 2006",0.1761
