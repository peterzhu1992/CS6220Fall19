1,A3BGYK1ELD652P,B00007KDV0,James Cook,"[1, 1]","Overall a sturdy set of horseshoes. They have rusted a bit over time, I suppose I should bring them in. But all in all this is a great set of serious horseshoes for a recreational used.",4,Good Horseshoes,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",0.245
2,AYL1UHSGC6YV2,B00007KDV0,N2Yakz,"[1, 1]",Bought this set to replace a cheaper set of iron shoes that didn't last a full day before a shoe split in half. The shoes are well balanced and the shape made for more ringers in my opinion. Would definitely recommend the set to anybody looking for a nice upgrade from the cheaper iron sets common in the big box stores.,5,nice horseshoe set,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",0.3546
3,A26LD9FQHTM8ZH,B00007KDV0,OlyNomad,"[3, 4]","My only experience with playing Horseshoes is when I was a kid with my Dad, so I wasn't quite sure what to look for when I got the whim to build a pit in our backyard. I went to the local sporting store and looked at sets and they seemed kind of cheesy so I came on here to look up sets and found this one. It was a little pricier than the ones in the store so I was hesitant to order, but after reading the reviews I did and after getting I them I found they are definitely worth the few extra bucks. They are quality, well-constructed and Made in the USA. They feel good in my hand and came with instructions to refresh me on how to play the game. The paint has chipped some but that hasn't bothered me since it doesn't interfere in playing the game. I would recommend this set to anyone interested in backyard games.",4,Well-constructed Horseshoe set,1315440000,"09 8, 2011",0.3063

I live in the desert so the shoes took quite a lot of abuse, hitting rocks on the ground, and they didn't miss a beat. This set is great.",5,Heavy Duty,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",0.0963
