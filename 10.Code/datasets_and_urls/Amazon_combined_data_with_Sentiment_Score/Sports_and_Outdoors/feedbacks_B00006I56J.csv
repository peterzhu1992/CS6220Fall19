1,A2ZC5ZF74KO28U,B00006I56J,GJack,"[3, 3]","Forget propane. In a real world long term crisis or emergency, propane will quickly be hard to come by. This stove uses Coleman Premium Fuel OR regular unleaded gasoline. Those supplies will last much longer. This thing will boil water in a flash or let you cook anything from stew to heavy game entrees. Rugged, compact and wind proof - I strongly recommend this product for your emergency preparedness supplies.",5,Perfect Emergency Stove,1348876800,"09 29, 2012",-0.1288

3,A1WBYOXQPMJQS5,B00006I56J,James L. Pautz II,"[3, 3]","I bought this stove from Amazon in 2011 and this is the third summer we've used it camping. The only differences comparing this stove to my father's from 30+ years ago is the color (his is a lighter green), the metal case is a little thinner (which isn't an issue at all...we haven't dented it in 30-40 times of use so far), and the tank doesn't let you fill it up when it is attached to the rest of the stove (which is a safety thing, and probably a wise decision). Functionally, it lights easier that my father's (likely because the parts are much newer and cleaner) and has burned with a blue flame every time (once it took a while, but every other time it was quick and easy). It also comes with a filter funnel that doesn't let you overfill/spill which is quite handy.We've been burning the Coleman White Gas which is cheaper and more efficient than stoves that use the propane canisters. It also burns unleaded gas if you need it in a pinch, but I've heard it isn't as clean as the white gas.The size on this thing is the main draw. You can fit 2 medium-to-large frying pans on this stove at the same time. TheColeman 2 Burner Dual Fuel Compact Liquid Fuel Stoveis quite frustrating to use if you want to do serious cooking, one medium sized pan is too large to fit on it, let alone two. TheColeman 2-Burner Classic Liquid Fuel Stoveis pretty much the same as the compact, it just has a red tank and isn't labeled dual fuel, even though you CAN burn both fuels on it.If you would prefer to make this a Triple Fuel stove via propane, you can buy theCentury Regulated Propane Converter (Grey)and use it with propane canisters or, with the addition of a hose, a propane tank. My cousin does this with his 3 burner version (discontinued) and it works great.I expect to get many more years of use out of this stove. Definitely recommended.",5,"Great Efficient Stove, Quality Parts, Should Last a long time",1372723200,"07 2, 2013",0.2666
4,A1NVZNIM4F2LIW,B00006I56J,J. Young,"[6, 6]","I prefer this stove to the propane tank version any day. If your camping trip turns into a real life or death situation you can always siphon gas from your vehicle to power this and other dual fuel devices. On a mellower note, carrying a can of camping fuel is much easier than a bunch of little propane tanks, especially if there is not a Walmart nearby to resupply.Coleman claims this unit has a 2 hour life at its maximum heat settings but I find that is more than you need. With a moderate setting the fuel can easily last several weekend camping trips.The wind flaps are cheesy and this is a light weight product (some feel it feels cheap) but if you're having to carry gear long distances, light/portable is what you want.You can use two medium sized pots/pans on this unit but you can also use a Wok on it. I have done this before to create a meal for a group of 10.I've never had any problems with this unit and highly recommend it.",4,"No real complaints, good camp stove",1318550400,"10 14, 2011",0.1072

6,A3KFSCJUHYVA2O,B00006I56J,R. Brooks Toyota Olympia,"[14, 16]","Coleman stoves have always been easy to dent, scratch, get burned on and are not for the weak of spirit. On the other hand, properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost. The white gas can be stored for years before using. Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots. I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones. It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out! I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous, tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect. By their nature camp stoves get stored a lot and used some. These are the good ones.",5,This product is better than the reviews have you think!,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",0.2836

Taxing on fuel. Having two hot plates is very convenient. At one can boil water for tea, and the other is to cook dinner. And just two burners to cook with a lot more convenient.

8,A16SW9SYAMJY9Z,B00006I56J,Sierrahoosier,"[1, 1]","It does what you need it to do and it does it well. My only gripe is that the second burner is underpowered when using the primary. The thing is, that's ok because the stove really isn't big enough for two vessels at once anyway. Stick with Coleman fuel when possible to keep the amount of soot down. Unleaded gas works great, too, but it's dirty.",5,The dual fuel stove is nearly perfect,1396396800,"04 2, 2014",0.0502
