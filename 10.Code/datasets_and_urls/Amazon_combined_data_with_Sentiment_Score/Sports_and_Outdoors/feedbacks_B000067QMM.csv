1,AV2C17YDAMJ0S,B000067QMM,gZaller gzaller,"[0, 0]","Any chain can be cut, but it takes bolt cutters, something the average bike thief doesn't normally carry. Bike thiefs do carry cable cutters: very affordable, easy to use, fit in your pocket and easily work on 90% of the anti-theft devices.This chain is well made and not so heavy it is like carrying around an anchor, completely defeating the benefit of having a light weight bicycle. Otherwise why not get a cheap beater bike no one would steal and a cheap cable lock thief's wouldn't bother to cut? Overall this configuration would weigh less and far less would be at risk.The price on this lock is unbelievably low compared to the competition, but it is real.",5,An exceptional value,1395273600,"03 20, 2014",-0.0946

This chain and lock are okay, and would provide a god deterrent, but if they want your bike, nothing is going to stop them.",4,Descent Chain,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",-0.3161
3,A5IMSRXL75UB,B000067QMM,J. F. O'Neill,"[5, 7]","This chain and lock's price is consistent with the level of security it provides, however, it is far too heavy.The only claims about the chain are that it is high tensile steel. However, tensile strength is not how bike chains are attacked. Tensile strength means pulling, and many hardware store chains provide good strength for hauling and securing things against that kind of resistance. However, cutting attacks involve shear and compression forces, and the properties of steel are quite different for resisting these kinds of forces. Many things with high tensile strength will cut like butter.Low security has its place, however, this lock is the right price, but it is far too heavy. One can get an equally low security cable lock which weighs far less and is more compact. Or one can get a higher security chain (for medium security, I would recommendKryptonite Keeper Integrated Chain Bicycle Lock) which has a chain designed to resist cutting attacks.This Mongoose chain is too easily cut, and provides very low security. It can be cut with bolt cutters one can conceal on one's person, and as such, it provides no more security than a cheap cable lock in terms of how bike thieves actually operate.The padlock is of low quality as well, and the one I have is very difficult to close as the tolerances are horrible. It is a big padlock of very low quality, and the chain provides very little resistance against cutting attacks.",2,"Cheap, Low Security, and Heavy",1377993600,"09 1, 2013",0.0316
4,AXNDQMUQEK9YO,B000067QMM,Maria,"[0, 0]","Compared to the other chain locks that I've seen, Kryptonite or what have you, this is BY FAR the cheapest and most epic chain for the money. It is HEAVY and I wouldn't think anything could cut through them unless you're a fireman with some epic hydraulic jaws on hand. Though heavy it leaves me feeling safe that my bike is secure and unlikely to be stolen in its entirety haha. Definitely go for this one folks!",5,Hefty hefty!,1371859200,"06 22, 2013",0.3528
