The downside is the green fabric putting mat itself, it is difficult to smooth out which means each time we roll it up to store it, the next time we bring it out we have to smooth it out all over again which is an annoyance. Also, the overall cheap look to the background and the stickers over the hazards. Everything but the ball return is cheap, so the $40 price tag is a little steep, I think I'd view it more favorably at $30.",3,Worth it for the ball return only,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",,0.2021

Otherwise the mat is my biggest complaint - it does not straighten out enough. The return mechanism is pretty good, the unit itself feels fairly cheap. My 7 and 10 year olds enjoy it, even set some obstacles to make the course more interesting.As far as using it in the office, I had a few bosses who like to &#34;practice&#34; at the office, and this would be a winner for a birthday gift.",3,Nice if you have an office,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",Ardeal Emi,0.5144

Getting the grip, the aim, the stroke, and everything else just right takes time and effort and Club Champ is here to help with the task.With this Club Champ product, you get nine feet of putting area to practice and improve your skill. The carpet comes folded and it can take time to work out the creases, but once flattened you are ready to grab a golf ball, your favorite putter, and start practicing.Probably the best feature of this Club Champ product is the ball return. It works well and continuously sends the ball back to you. I like that I can stand in one place and putt the ball over and over again. This makes it nice not just for putting practice, but also for kids who can entertain themselves without much frustration.It&#8217;s cool to have a way to practice one&#8217;s putting, but there are problems with this product that lead me to lower my rating. The biggest issue I have is with the construction. It is made about as cheaply as possible, apparently for maximum profits. And yes, the design, with its sticker &#8220;traps&#8221; for sand and water and its background of trees is silly. But it&#8217;s the construction that bothers me the most. With repeated use, it&#8217;s only a matter of time until the putting green tears or something breaks.My overall opinion of this Club Champ product is average overall. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, but I will go ahead and give it 3 because it does succeed at what it was intended to do: Help you practice putting and returning the ball so that you won&#8217;t have to chase it down. Take away the ball return feature and it would lose its appeal, but as it stands, it&#8217;s acceptable enough to earn a slight recommendation.",3,Stand in Place and Putt Away!,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",Bryan Carey Bryan Carey,0.2852
3,ACL0T7X1THPAV,B00000J6JO,"[0, 0]","There's not much good to say about this item, other than it can give you some temporary entertainment before it goes into a closet. The 9' rug that's attached is folded rather than rolled, so I am still waiting after 2 days for the folds to level out into a flat surface. The little flag stick does not stand up in the hole behind the cup. The plastic base is very thin and could easily be ruined with one step or fall onto it. The ball return does not always return the ball, so you have to fiddle with it from time to time to get the ball to pop out. There are 'no batteries required' because you must be within a few feet of a wall outlet to plug it in.I used to have something similar in the 80s that was made of thicker plastic and was just the tray and ball return - you would putt across your carpet or hard floor, so I get the idea. But this one just isn't worth the money if you want it for more than just a novelty toy. As an alternative if you are more serious about putting practice indoors, I reviewed theSKLZ Vari-Break Putting Course, which has better carpet and some foam 'breaks' you can put under it, although it has no ball return or backstop.",2,Cheaply made toy,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",Bryan Cass Bee Ry Boogy,-0.0365

5,ACJT8MUC0LRF0,B00000J6JO,"[0, 0]","We had a lot of fun playing with the Putt 'N Hazzard, but I don't believe that it would work well for any kind of serious practice. Most of the successful putting that went on could be more attributed to luck more than anything else. The grass was somewhat wrinkled and took a while to settle down. Everyone had to get used to the eccentricities of the Putt 'N Hazzard, which ended up being more of a hazard than anything else.Ellie Mae, the cat, had more fun than anyone as she tried to catch the golf ball when it was returned. That is when it decided it would return. More often than not it would get stuck and sit until someone tapped it with the putter. The background of the Putt 'N Hazard is a hologram, but nothing that will hold up if it's hit frequently. The sand and water hazards would catch the ball readily and would guide the golf ball into the chute.The return was never consistent and that's where I feel it would be frustrating if any of us were going to use it for practice. As a form of entertainment, it was fun, but was soon put aside. I don't think I'd recommend it for practice because of the totally inconsistent ball return. For entertainment, maybe, but only if you have a lot of money to throw around. It's a so-so type of product, but with limitations.",3,"The Putt 'N Hazard was fun, but the ball return was totally inconsistent ...",1401235200,"05 28, 2014",D. Fowler,0.1338
6,A1GCZ07XRJX858,B00000J6JO,"[2, 3]","It is a length of turf-type mat with a plastic assembly that has the hole, and two traps (one colored blue for water and one colored tan for sand). All three lead into the automatic ball return that works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.The mat comes folded up so it has creases that can give you a rolling green affect that is totally unrealistic. I haven't found a way to get those creases totally out and I've had it flat on the floor for over a week.This will add nothing to your putting game other than having a some-time ball return for playing around. The whole apparatus seems cheaply made and I can think of a lot of other things I would rather have for the cost of this.Here's the measure of this device: my wife has never played golf, even the miniature variety. She tried eight putts, making six of them. Then she asked what else does it do? I said Nothing. She sat down. I moved it into another room against the wall. 'Nuf said.Not horrible. Not great.

I have 5 different models of these electric return putting greens and in my observation, it seems like they are all very similar in quality and construction. The speed on all of them are a little slow, and the plastic is a little cheap and thin. But they do work as far as getting some practice on the tempo and direction of your putt. For the price it is being sold, it is a good deal. Please do not try to compare this to the quality of putting greens 5 times its price. If you want to get one that is an excellent and accurate analog of a real green, expect to pay that much more.I have the professional type of putting which I had ordered and it cost me $230 for almost the same dimension as this, and it did not come with an electric ball return.",5,Good for practicing your technique,1404518400,"07 5, 2014",Dr. Wilfredo M.

8,A1TS45JWJVOSSW,B00000J6JO,"[0, 0]","For years we have had putting machines that kick the ball back to you. Great for practice putting when you are bored with everything else. However, putting on your living room carpet is not at all like putting on an undulating green with grass on the course. It is hard to maintain interest for even a avid golfer.The Club Champ Super Sized Electric Putt N' Hazzard Putting Mat changes that dramatically. First off, it comes with carpet of its own similar to what you find on mini-golf courses, so you don't have the irregularities of the house carpet textures. It is about 9 feet long so it gives you an opportunity to truly practice. There are 3 destinations the putted ball can reach...the hole itself, a water hazard (no water), and a sand trap (no sand). If it goes in any of the 3, the ball is kicked back to you, and it comes back with sufficient force to bring it back the full 9' distance.We found that by placing small objects under one or both edges you can make the putting more difficult by requiring the player to take the angles into account so it is not a straight putt any longer. Also, we made the 9' runner into small hills to putt over...all the different layouts made it a fun game for the entire family.It comes with a &#34;&#34;3D&#34; background of trees, is simple to assemble, and high quality materials. No clubs or balls included.Fun game for ages 4 to 94 (our household and relatives who have played this in the last few days).",5,This was a huge hit with the entire family,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",Duane Sparks Duane,0.1478
9,AYB4ELCS5AM8P,B00000J6JO,"[0, 0]","This is a putting mat with a ball return which is very similar to any putting mat I've ever used. It has a length of green which is basically a fuzzy piece of fabric, a slope at the end, 3 features including a ball return. I've seen many of these putting mats and the inexpensive ones are all pretty much the same price and similar features. I suspect this one costs more because of the ball return feature. Others which don't have a return and is simply a piece of green fabric with holes would cost less. At the other end of the spectrum you can buy ones costing thousands of dollars. But I digress. For this price, this is not a bad putting mat. It's got a nice 9ft green, 3 features and the return.",4,Putting mat...,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",John B. Goode JBG,0.1167
10,ABQWMANK4AR63,B00000J6JO,"[1, 1]","I had waited a while trying to flatten out the &#34;green&#34; since it was all kinked and bumpy from being rolled up for storage and shipment. I hadn't thought of ironing it like another reviewer mentioned they did.I've had a small auto-return cup, the &#34;normal&#34; style, that my 10 year old and I use around the house, but I never cared for just having that piece only, and having to putt across the carpet. So I liked that this gave a better surface to putt over. It is considerably better than just using carpet or hard flooring.However, that's about where the good things I can say about this ends. It's not very well made. The first real dislike I had was the fake background. It slides into a slot, which would be fine, except they put VELCRO on this. Anyone who knows Velcro knows that it's not something that can &#34;slide&#34; into place. The fasteners start to catch as soon as you get this in place, so you can't just insert it. It would've been MUCH better to just have been held by friction and pressure. You can kind of almost get it in alright if you very carefully pull it as hard against the &#34;front&#34; of the slot as you can to try to keep all the Velcro from attaching, but it's not something that should even be an issue. I ended up just putting it inside a box tipped on its side to catch any balls that would jump the rear ledge when my son gets a little enthusiastic about his swing.The plastic is some pretty low grade material as well, the kind that cracks pretty easily.The cord has a pretty average length, so at least it's not too short to reach an outlet somewhere without having this right up against the wall. But I've seen better ball return systems. I thought at first it may just be because I had it in the box so it wasn't quite set up the way it &#34;should&#34; be, but even removing it from there, I encountered many instances of having to scuff my foot along the &#34;green&#34; to wiggle it enough to get the ball to activate the system. Sometimes that wasn't enough and I had to walk up to it and nudge with my foot to get it to return. The return power at least was adequate to get the ball back to me.The length of the green is good, but I would have preferred something with a little more solid of a base, some heavier rubberized base, so that you could store it rolled up again, but still have it lay flat as soon as you unrolled it. This stuff tends to keep those bends in it slightly when you pull it out to use again. I can see keeping it with the cheaper stuff if they were concerned about weight, but I would've preferred something heavier to lay flat instantly when I want to use it.All told, I'm just not very impressed with this one other than the putting surface itself once I get it to stay flat.",2,"It's alright, but I've seen better",1402963200,"06 17, 2014",John S.

11,AGVDI7RLT24WJ,B00000J6JO,"[1, 1]","The idea is nice, and you can tell that the designers and engineers envisioned a better product.Pros: The ball return works great. It returns the ball if it enters the cup or either trap, It does not work if you use the pin (flag), however. I actually like the 3-D lenticular background; I think it was a nice touch.Cons: Cheaply made. The base is made from thin plastic. The glue that keeps the mat attached to the plastic base came off in shipping. The mat has a bump from being folded in the box for shipping. The velcro that attaches the background scenery to the base comes unglued easily and the scenery is very difficult to install and remove, you have to push it between two pieces of velcro. There is a gap in the plastic base behind the hole that seems to serve no function. There is exposed glue on the velcro in back as it crosses over this gap. If the pin is placed in it's hole, it blocks the ball return!!!!! It does indeed need no batteries, it must be plugged in! This is not enhanced convenience.I might consider this a toy, more than a serious practice mat, but it is not sturdy enough for children.",2,Low quality product,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",J.

12,A34UVV757IKPVB,B00000J6JO,"[0, 0]","I saw a lot of negative reviews for this practice mat, but it looks like they've updated the device, because it worked really well for me!First, for the most part, it's all one piece. The putting mat is all one piece; there is no gap or attaching of the putting surface. You just unroll it. It's not the BEST surface; mine has been unrolled for days, but is still &#34;bumpy&#34; from where it was unrolled. But, it's all one piece. The only things you need to do is attach the tree-backdrop (velcro is used here), add a sticker for the bottom of the &#34;hole&#34;, and stick in the flag. I noticed the instructions were not applicable to the putting green I received; the instructions talked about putting the ball-return in place, etc, but really this is plug and play. I did notice a problem with the flag; the hole that holds it goes down into the ball-return area, so I just don't use the flag. The neat thing about this is that if you mis-hit a ball into the &#34;water&#34; or &#34;trap&#34;, it feeds the ball into the center area and shoots the ball back at you. It's a powerful ball-return; it seems to depend on where the ball is located once the ball-return kicks in. Sometimes the ball would roll back off the mat, sometimes it would make it halfway.It functions just fine. Even with the &#34;bumps&#34; in the mat, I still made good putts. It's more of a neat toy than a serious practice device: the hole has an incline just before it, so you have to hit the ball harder than you would normally. I had some solid shots get hung up on the incline at the end. Your mis-hits have to be gentle; I had a few roll up onto the back of the green and roll back down, blocking the path of future hits. Sometimes balls would get hung-up on the ball return area. I would just hit a second ball, and the ball-return would shoot them back out.For the most part, I would recommend this toy. It's nice to not have to walk back and forth for every shot just to get your ball. The green surface isn't the thickest I've seen, but it's OK. It's a fun distraction rather than a serious training device, and I think it would make a really good gift.",4,Really good gift - more for fun than for practice.,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",justsomeguy,0.1751
