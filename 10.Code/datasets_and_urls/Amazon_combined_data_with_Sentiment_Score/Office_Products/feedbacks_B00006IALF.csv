It is sturdy and the perfect size for under my desk, not so big as to get in the way, not too small so I have to empty it constantly. I'm very satisfied.",5,Sturdy,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",0.1236

It is too big for grocery store plastic bag, too small for a kitchen trash can liner - I am going to have to investigate to see what size fits. I have to have liners in my trash cans! Good size in that it fits under the desk and holds a lot - but not large like a kitchen trash can. I have lots of trash! It is sturdy and can the abuse of being run over or used like a basketball hoop. I bet your house is not as exciting!",4,It's a Trash Can!,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",-0.1381

It is solidly built, simply and elegantly designed, and much larger than my previous wastebasket. It is indeed even larger than what I had imagined it to be, and is more than adequate for most of my office waste - small papers, wrappers, etc. It manages to add an extra sense of productivity to my work area, and I expect to be using it for many years to come.

9,AZMY6E8B52L2T,B00006IALF,JP J.P.,"[9, 9]","Sturdy, durable and sleek. In three words that sums up this wastebasket; it is just fantastic. Most of my organizers and other office equipment are black and mesh and this coordinates perfectly with them. Rubbermaid and Rolodex both intermix well especially in this black mesh design. Comparing prices between local stores and Amazon have this product priced nearly the same. I bought this at my local store to have it quicker however it's cost effective at the current price of under $10 no matter where you buy it.",5,Goes Great With Other Mesh Rubbermaid Office Products...,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",0.3515

17,AGB7UQZMVHNUJ,B00006IALF,NewDiane I live to read!,"[5, 6]","I coveted this trash can, which my sister owned for years, until she finally relented and gave it to me. Of course it works perfectly, and no tiny debris has ever fallen through the mesh. That was a concern, as I have cats and worried that some staple or splinter would fall out and they'd eat it. My only complaint is that the basket is much too nice to line with a plastic trash bag, which means every time I empty it, I have to turn it upside down over the bag. This is a fairly large basket and holds a lot, so if I wait until it's full, it's quite heavy. But I don't care. This is just a wonderfully classy, sturdy waste basket!",5,Too pretty to use a liner,1337817600,"05 24, 2012",-0.0151

I should probably start lining it. It is mesh, so it will be a little hard to clean. Otherwise, I really like it.",5,Great basket.,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",0.2905
19,A11FX8HL2ANK6T,B00006IALF,Peter Suslock,"[1, 1]","Loving the look of quality wire mesh accessories, this wastebasket was a perfect choice.It's just the right size for a home office and fits under the new glass desk (also from Amazon) perfectly. What's particularly nice about both glass and open mesh is they lend the illusion and feeling of more space - an especially nice touch for small spaces.Rolodex has been making top quality products for decades - and although this may merely be a wastebasket they haven't skimped here one bit. The wire is coated with a shiny black enamel. There are no sharp edges or seams - a problem with lesser quality items with a similar look. Even the seam is welded perfectly and completely smooth.The base is well weighted so tip over isn't a problem and the little feet on the bottom keep raised a bit off the floor and level.The basket holds an ample amount of scrunched up papers. As a copywriter by trade I end up with lot's of scrunched up paper.The wastebasket matches my desk accessories perfectly - so although far from a center piece, it's a nice touch.It arrived in perfect shape, without a single dent or scratch. These baskets really do sell for around $30 and up - to find this here on Amazon for a mere $9.82 is an absolute steal. Plus if you're a Prime member, this item is eligible so two day shipping is 100% free.A great addition to any office - at an unbeatable price.",5,Quality Product By Rolodex At An Unbeatable Price!,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",0.3901
