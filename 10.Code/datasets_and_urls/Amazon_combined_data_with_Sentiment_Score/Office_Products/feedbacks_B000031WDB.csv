Would be nice with a bit more friction to the base of the pad, it will tend to slip around if motivated by the user.",3,"Basic mouse pad, no frills.",1399680000,"05 10, 2014",0.2022

Really good price and saved getting out in the crowds to buy a smaller item. Love the add-on feature, but shipping with Prime is free anyway! Bought a few while I was at it, good price, excellent quality.",5,"Perfect, solid, gorgeous color !",1353801600,"11 25, 2012",0.5757
4,A3UBDVOL5UDIIB,B000031WDB,Laura,"[0, 0]","For the price alone I gave this four stars. It is basic old fashioned soft foam with a knit fabric top. The best thing about this pad is the beautiful red color (which is why I ordered it) so if you care about that I recommend it. If you have an older mouse I think this pad will be fine, but for my optical Logitech M305 the soft material creates a bit of drag, it performs better with the denser, thinner foam and smoother plastic type top. I have found a good use for it, however, when I travel with my laptop and don't have a table or place to use the mouse. I cut it in half, placing the half on the bottom flat part of my laptop, the softer foam of this pad stays in place better on the laptop.",4,Standard old school mouse pad,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",0.3839

I thought by the description it would be thicker, but it is better than the free one I got at the bank, yet not the old heavy neoprene style.

8,A1Q1DHNZRTK3XH,B000031WDB,Purple Violets,"[1, 1]","This mouse pad works great with my optical mouse. It isn't thick and bulky nor is it a slippery vinyl pad. It's the perfect size to sit next to my keyboard along with my bead-filled wrist cushion. It is a COMFORTABLE mouse pad covered with a soft polyester fabric attached to a non-skid sponge rubber base. The texture provides good control for my mouse. For me, it's the perfect mouse pad, it's a nice color, and the price is right, too!",5,Fellowes Blue Mouse Pad,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",0.5052

The adhesive or bonding process isn't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad.
