0,A87N6UTYA6NOB,B00006B80P,B. Clark G35,"[0, 0]",We used these to label client CD's before we ship them. We add our logo and and some custom text and it works great. We used roxio disc label maker or something to actually print the items but this paper was very good. No smudging or any issues like that. The adhesive stuck very well to the CD's. It is a little difficult to line them up correctly at first but eventually you get the hang of it.,4,Worked well,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",0.2161
1,AAV5IVZ1RNQU1,B00006B80P,Craig Halsey Craig Halsey,"[0, 0]","I think they're rotten, and they don't begin to compare in quality with my earlier, bona fide Memorex CD labels. The reason I say they're rotten is because the labels won't come off in one piece allowing me to center them very nicely on the CD/DVD, so it's made it a lot more work for me!",1,They're rotten!,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",-0.3066
2,ADOR3TR7GDF68,B00006B80P,F T. A.,"[0, 0]",Came with a total of 300 and the quality is very high! does not get much better than this. I would recommend.,5,Perfect 10/10,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",0.0067
3,A1OHW2VAFFGYPI,B00006B80P,gfa,"[1, 1]",I have been using these labels for several months now for DVD's I have recorded for public access television. The labels work just great and are much less expensive than what I can get at an office supply store. Highly recommend.,5,Great labels,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",0.3483
4,A1E7VTRDMI4XMV,B00006B80P,Hal Hal,"[0, 0]",I find this product of Memorex labels to be what I wanted at a very reasonable price. The value for what it cost surpass that which if attempted to by at an office store locally can not compare.,5,CD /DVD Labels,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",0.17
5,A8X8D4BUY5DFU,B00006B80P,Joseph M. Seda,"[0, 0]","Reasonably high contrast, vivid, uniformly strong adhesive, and smooth matte paper finish. Very good design and quality for the money. Probably the best labels I have used in years.",5,Very good quality labels,1382572800,"10 24, 2013",0.5467
6,A13WOT3RSXKRD5,B00006B80P,LD,"[0, 0]","I keep buying the 300 packs every time I run out. They have printed, stuck, and look great on both my CDs and DVDs. I use the inside small ones for several categories, like vacations and backups. I use the large ones for music lists of albums. So I end up getting 600 discs worth out of each package. I much prefer labeling this way rather than using Lightscribe.",5,The perfect label for me,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",0.1774
7,A3R1GJY2MY8041,B00006B80P,Lord Rhys dog lover,"[0, 0]","if you look at other reviews, someone once mentioned that you have to let them sit for a while. I let them sit for about six hours before using them otherwise for some reason they don't want to release from the backer, it's strange, but that's what I've found. I just purchased my last batch of these labels. As soon as they run out I will be using a printer that will print directly onto the discs, much simpler and better too. It all depends on how many discs you make.",3,ok..but not great,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",0.0619
