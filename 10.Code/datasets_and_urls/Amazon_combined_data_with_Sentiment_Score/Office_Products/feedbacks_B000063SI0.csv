They even give directions with arrows so the pieces slide right in, a very small notch on the plastic pieces that when slid on the pole (slowly) you can feel snap into place, at that point the shelve will slide into place. Used a rubber mallet to get then tight.",5,Pretty Simple if ...,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",,0.1468

3,ABUE0ALHKWKHC,B000063SI0,"[0, 0]","I have very limited space in my home and that certainly holds true for my pantry. It's not that I collect a lot of junk but everyday items just seem to be overflowing. I bought this cart to put outside my pantry door to hold all those items which the pantry can't hold. When I need to get into the pantry, I just roll the cart a foot out of the way and roll it back when I'm done digging around in there. This cart truly makes my life so much easier.This cart is very sturdy and well built, I just LOVE it ! It rolls around easily on my tile floors and it holds lots and lots. I really didn't understand the directions on how to put it together but by just looking at the parts and the photo on the box you can easily figure it out for yourself. I'm already thinking about buying another cart for a back closet where it will help create an organized place as well. Don't hesitate to buy this if you need more space,it really does the trick !",5,The Art of Organizing.....,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",,0.3376
4,A33AQPJYH7UUXR,B000063SI0,"[0, 0]","I own two of these carts in different sizes. This one stays put in the kitchen and rotates my seasonal appliances; for example, I bake more in the winter than in summer so it holds large glass storage containers with flour, sugar, etc. In spring and summer it will rotate to hold my breadmaker, blender for summer fruit smoothies, etc.The second cart has moved from room to room over the years holding everything from office supplies, to books, storage boxes, extra clothing in closets, etc.Assembly is relatively easy, even if you aren't very handy. It took me about fifteen minutes from start to finish and required only a rubber mallet to assist. The first attempt at assembly had things a little uneven because the plastic collars that hold the shelves at a certain height, the collars kept slipping as I would move to do the next leg. On the second try I had to lightly assemble the pieces and then firmly tap everything in place once all was set. Getting all four lightly seated worked better to have everything level at the end.My only real quibble is with the cheap casters; when doing my research on these it came up that they can seriously scratch fine wood floors. I don't move these around much after they've been assigned a task so not a real big issue for me but something you may want to keep in mind if the rolling feature is important to you.These are fairly well made, pretty sturdy, and have performed well considering the budget price tag. If you have a 'Mart locally you may want to compare but Amazon is pretty competitively priced with these.Pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.",4,"good value, very versatile",1328400000,"02 5, 2012",,0.3248
5,A343264GQDQ8Z0,B000063SI0,"[0, 0]","It is sturdy as wire shelf units go, rolls well, clean looking, It is a little shorter than my counter top and fits perfectly at the end of my base cupboards just under the lip of the counter top. I purchased it to put a berkey water purifier on or toaster oven. I don't think it would work for the kitchen aid counter top mixer because of the vibration. I wish I would have had it when Joe was alive. I served his dinner in the den so he could watch tv during dinner. A tray on top would have eliminate the extra trips for condiments, drinks, etc. Clean up would have been so much easier too one trip back to the kitchen. It would make a great towel and toiletry unit for the bath. The shelves are adjustable. Assembly is a bit confusing. I thought I was missing the (F) pieces. Later I found it was pre attached. I had 8 additional pieces, that were not visible on the assembly diagram. I figured out where they go. It was great fun. If you want to use the unit separately you will need them to finish the ends. Well worth the price I will probably get another one",5,very nice,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",,0.2408

Just start by screwing the long tubes together - this IS step one. The rest is figure it out as you go - the instructions aren't great - but it winds up being a decent cart.Not meant to lean on, feel a LITTLE tippy - but nothing that interfere with normal functioning.

7,A3112D9P7HXV0E,B000063SI0,"[0, 0]","The cart is well made, craftsmanship, assembly, etc. no complaints.My only gripe is that the shelves are (to me) up-side-down. I dont want the 'lip' on the shelf pointing upwards. Most of my wire shelves have the lip pointing down at the front tip of the shelf. This makes it more convenient to pull out larger jugs off the shelf. I suppose some can argue that the jugs could slip off while one moves the cart, so it is better to have the lip pointing up.99% of the time the cart is stationary for me. only a few times a year I would move it out of the utility room to make more room for carrying bulky things through the utility room. That said, I would rather have at least the top and center shelves to have the lip pointing down.",3,"Hummmmm.... good, but I prefered up side down",1348099200,"09 20, 2012",,0.0395

9,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B000063SI0,"[0, 0]","This is now the second Whitmor cart I've purchased. I got it for insulation, really: putting the cart in a picture window allows light in; yet the stuff on its shelves, blocks air flow when it's too hot (or cold). Easy to move out of the way.If you like lipped shelves, then you will like this cart. You cannot install the shelving properly, lip-down: each shelf is potentially unstable if bumped. That will matter if what's on the shelf is heavy or important. As in, a computer. For this product would otherwise be ideal for holding computers. So, I assembled the cart lip-up. HINT: do the bottom shelf first, and put the wheels on last. It's easy to assemble, if done that way.EDIT: the first cart (review below) is now deployed such that an old Win98 Dell Dimension tower sits on the lowest shelf, and an HP Laserjet 4 sits on the top shelf. In between, is a shelf for paper and peripherals. The monitor sits right of the cart, in white shelving. That gives you a sense of computer station usage. Import: it's easy to move the unit out to plug and unplug, remove paper jams, etc.Original review of the first cart, follows below. Second is substantially the same.=====On the cart, I had placed my Optiplex 780 (SFF) with monitor on the top shelf; my huge Dell 8400 tower sits on the lowest shelf; in between (12 clearance), are peripherals and wireless keyboards useful with either computer. It is stable, and moves well on the house carpeting. Thus I can wheel it forward for clearer viewing, getting behind to mess with cables, etc.I don't want to lift the tower out from the lower shelf, but merely slide it. The lipping problem is solved by putting a large but relatively thin (1) coffee-table-sized book beneath each computer, enabling each machine to slide above the lip. It works, but is not ideal. I lined middle shelf with rubbery kitchen drawer liner, to keep air flow but mask the cords below.So only due to the lip-up shelving, is this five-star product rated four stars. If you prefer a lip-down design, get the similar-quality Seville cart here in Amazon for about the same price. I bought the Sevilles, too (and reviewed them).NOTE: a computer chassis on a chrome chart will emit a vibration when on. Depends on the type of chassis. The old-fashioned tower emits almost no vibration. But a small form factor like the Dell 780, emits a substantial hum you can feel when you touch the cart. Due to that, the above-mentioned 'book' is more important: it nearly eliminates the vibration.",4,"SHELVES ARE LIPPED, but quality computer workstation",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",,0.0996

12,AOMOTMG7R8AUO,B000063SI0,"[1, 1]",I got this on a timely manner. Very easy to assemble. I found that putting the wheel first and locking the plastic brackets on the last line helps.

Tips:1. Disobey the instructions and put the wheels on first.2. Only clip the plastic supports for one shelf at once, starting at the bottom. Add that shelf. Repeat.3. If lifting it, don't try to pick it up from the shelves, pick it up from the uprights. The connectors only work in compression, not in tension.The clips never look that strong, but they work very well in practice, and the same construction holds up for much larger and heavier units than this.",5,Great little unit,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",Android,0.033

18,A3963R7EPE3A7E,B000063SI0,"[3, 3]","It is seldom that we get a chance to use such a diverse piece of handy equipment and this Whitmor Supreme Cart is simply the most versatile helper I have found in years. It is well made, sturdy, easy to use and stores almost anywhere there is sufficient space.While just recently constructing a much larger shelf system that provided the opportunity to spout some awful words, this 'tool' (it really is like a tool) was a snap to put together. The instructions were adequate and with a little pre-reading and thoughtful re-reading of the instructions it came together in less than 30 minutes. It would have taken less time had I not had the assistance of our puppy inspecting each and every move while attempting to assist. (Before I forget let me remind anyone buying one of these that a key missing part of my instructions did not include 'listen for the click' or some other form of assistance when snapping two black shelf holders. It takes 8 shelf holders for each shelf and had I not placed a pair on each corner's indented part of the rail and did not hear that click when the holder was seated properly the shelf would not stay put. I wish I could have worded that better but then again I wish for other things that do not happen. Take the two black pieces and just fiddle with them on the rod and move it around until you hear the click. No click? Do not use until you hear it. The click is the key. Whew. Hush.) Because I wanted the locking wheels on the front of the cart, I placed a piece of bright tape so I only had one choice. It was somewhat embarassing to put the locking wheels on opposite corners. By now if anyone has read this far these are such minor comments they barely deserve space; however, if one person is assisted I'm happy just as I am with the cart. It is handy and useful or a combination of values that we seldom receive in one unit.I highly recommend this cart and will add to my Cart Kingdom with another one later.",5,One Fantastic Little Cart,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",John N.
