3,A1YRIE0SGJ1PFQ,B00004Z63V,Lucy Hamm Gus Ryan,"[0, 0]","I use these Note Card sheets for printing all my greeting cards. For Christmas cards, thank you cards, get well cards, etc... I subscribe to a greeting card membership that allows me to make my own cards... to edit the verses, and to even modify the designs. I use these ALL THE TIME for all my cards. They are great. I have both size sheets to make the 4 x 5 cards and to make the larger cards of 5 x 8. Amazon supplies me with the material, and I make the cards.. it is FUN and I even get to add my name to the cards too. Avery is the best product for making cards. Their paper is QUALITY and Avery makes ALL types of paper to print your cards on...Thank you Avery and thank you Amazon.",5,Avery Note Cards are GREAT,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",0.419

6,A2QRXQPHDMFCQV,B00004Z63V,SanjeevP Bottom Line,"[9, 9]","These are very good quality cards that can be printed for any purpose - Thank You, Invitation, X-mas cards etc. etc. Although the box says that they are for inkjet printers, I have used them in Dell, Brother & Samsung laser printers without any problem.But I did need to download the template from the Microsoft Office web site. The template also works for iWork & Pages in Mac - just open the template from the File menu in Pages. Then I found out that Avery has software providing templates for all its products at its web site. The software is DesignPro for Mac and Wizard for Microsoft Office on Windows and is available for free download at Avery web site. As of July each card and envelope comes to about 28 cents a card. Not bad.Bottom line - good product, saves from running to store each time you need a different kind of card and then you can also customize the card.",4,Multipurpose Cards But Need Software Templates From Avery Web Site,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",0.2051
