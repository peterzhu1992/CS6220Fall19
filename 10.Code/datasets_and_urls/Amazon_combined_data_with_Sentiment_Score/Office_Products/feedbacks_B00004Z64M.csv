0,A2IDCSC6NVONIZ,B00004Z64M,2Cents!,"[0, 0]",Can't beat this price for 700 labels. Works perfectly in my Dymo LabelWriter 400. I have not experienced any of the issues reported by other users such as labels not printing due to no black markings on the reverse side of the label. Nor have I had any issues with them not being sticky enough. It will take a while for me to go through these. I don't print a lot of labels. But I will definently purchase again.,5,Great Deal,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",0.0487
