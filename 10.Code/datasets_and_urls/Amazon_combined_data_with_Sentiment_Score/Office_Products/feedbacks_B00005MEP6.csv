0,A1XGJ7TLP5Y3XC,B00005MEP6,"[10, 10]","Unlike many reviewers who spill out their thoughts after a few days with their new toy, we've had our new Brother HL-1440 about six months -- and the short form is that we are highly satisfied. This is our third laser (the prior two being HP 4P and 5P -- typical home models) so we're used to good quality printing. No exception is the output of the Brother and the speed is quite decent as well. Best of all, we have not yet had a jam, despite printing probably about 2500 pages or so since putting it into service. We're still on the original toner as well!We use both the manual feed slot a lot (for envelopes and special paper or card stock) as well as the high capacity tray with excellent results. Our only quibble is that the feed slot can be a little tricky to get the paper straight, so sometimes the printout is crooked. The printer is a little slow to startup and print first page if it had previously been in sleep mode but nothing that unusual. Sometimes our lights dim a little when it fires up, so we're guessing it draws some pretty good power at that instant!Incidentally we used the parallel interface at first and now use the USB connection -- no problem with either. The software was easy to install and stepped you through the startup proces quite clearly.Bottom line, we've been totally delighted with the product -- and consider it almost unbeatable at the low price we paid!",4,"Wonderful home laser at very low price, few quibbles",1106524800,"01 24, 2005",,0.4598
1,AI5OS4RQQIUMJ,B00005MEP6,"[76, 77]","I selected this printer over the Samsung ML-1430 and the Hewlett Packard LaserJet 1000. After reviewing all three online and then live at an office supply store, I ordered the Brother HL-1440. While the print quality may be similar for all three printers, the Brother HL-1440's build quality, easy memory upgrade path, and cheap consummables made it the clear front runner. Further distinguishing this machine is its superb handling of thicker media. It produces excellent results on cardstock, using a convenient manual feed slot on the front of the machine. Note also that the paper handling of the Brother is, in general, more robust than its Samsung and HP counterparts. The Samsung uses the top-loaded, ink-jet style paper feed system that tends to have less precise alignment. The HP uses a non-removable paper tray that is flimsy at best. The Brother, on the otherhand, uses a standard removable paper tray that is durable and handles envelopes and legal-sized paper just as easily as letter-sized. (And don't discount the handy manual feed for the single envelope.)Out of the box, USB setup of this unit on a Windows XP Home machine was a snap. The 1440 comes with a fully illustrated easy setup guide that will have you up and running in no time. All XP drivers are available on the disks that are shipping with these machines at the time of this review.One last note: Don't forget to order a USB (or parallel) cable with your printer!",5,Beats All Other Printers in this Class,1038268800,"11 26, 2002",Amy S.,0.3579
2,A14JBDSWKPKTZA,B00005MEP6,"[5, 6]","Welcome to the world of laser printing. You're talking to someone who came from a time when laser printers were a five figure investment. Sure they created print that was so smooth, that the edges were like glass, even under a microscope. Like the rest of us, we trudged through the fuzzy, dull, and off gray text of bubble jets, until they finally created one that would give you a nice edge to the naked eye. Under a microscope even todays latest results are not equal to this inexpensive 1440.To be creating professional looking text for only two cents per page, and at the rate of up to 15 PPM, for this kind of money makes it a must have. I broke out the super magnifying glass and the edges are glass smooth. My Lexmark X83, which is touted at laser like doesn't pass the under the microscope test. I still like the X83 for color work, and since it is a multi-user machine, for it's scanning and copying features. If you have a bubble jet, or inkjet machine, you want a Brother laser printer too. You can hook one up to the USB port, and put the other one on your printer port, thanks to Brothers dual input, standard printer cable, or USB capacity.Some other great features are: 250 sheet paper tray that sits under the unit, which is reminiscent of the better machines. With up to 15 PPM print speed, the first time you see it print, you think it is a printing mistake because it is coming out so fast. No sooner does the previous sheet hit the tray, one is coming out right on top of it. It comes with 2 Meg of ram built in, and is expandable with a single slot which will take up to a 128 Meg chip. (Something available very inexpensively for a generic, check it out via a google search.) The main feature of the brother line of printers is that they have a very professional look for an entry level laser.First and foremost, as stated in Consumer Reports, who rated the Brother 1440 as their number one pick, the per page print cost is only 2 cents per page. Compared to a MINIMUM of 6 cents, and as much as $1.50 per page for an inkjet photograph, you can see how quickly printing costs can add up. With the Brother laser printers, you can concentrate more on how you can print your message to the world, instead of how you are going to afford to keep pumping lots of money into your inkjet cartridges.A key advantage to a laser printer is that they use a dry powder, instead of wet ink that can and does dry out. I have a friend who bought an NEC laser in 1985, printed infrequently, and the cartridge just ran out in the last couple of years. Not a common example, but it gives you a good idea of the advantages of a laser using dry powder.Comparing the Brother 5040, which comes with 8 meg of ram instead of 2, has more onboard fonts, and several other capacities, as described in the owners manual, to the 1440, makes you want to buy that one instead. BUT Consumer Reports rated the 1440 as their top pick, and the 5040 rated about 5th in line. They stated it was the loudest of the printers, had comparable text quality, but didn't score quite as well in printing graphics. Mate that to the reduced price of the 1440, and the fact that a ram chip upgrade is inexpensive, makes the world of quality laser printing something everyone should have.Brother just came out with the 5140 to replace the 5040, but the only improvement is a faster print speed of 21 PPM instead of 17. The 1440 is rated at 15.First and foremost is the top quality, textbook level of printing, for such a small amount of money. If you buy a 1440 at current prices, and then at replacement time, buy one of the generic replacement toner cartridges that produce twice the number of pages as the standard ones, you can bring the price per page cost down to a penny. That is quite a savings over the five cents per page copying cost at your local office store.The speed, flexibility, and capacity of producing documents on demand, makes this a good investment.Heed the warnings on the bag containing the cartridge, and DO NOT move the machine without first removing the cartridge, or you can seriously damage the printer. That is probably the reason why some people were getting streaks. When the toner gets low, and you start to get a gray background on the pages, replace it.I haven't been this excited about a business tool in quite some time. It will make a great addition to your arsenal. Highly recommended.",5,"Let's See, the 1440, the 5040, the 5140 Decisions, Decisions",1082073600,"04 16, 2004",Bob Feeser MillCrafters.com,0.2592
3,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005MEP6,"[14, 14]","I waited several months after purchasing this laser printer before reviewing it to more accurately gauge its performance. So far, I have not had any trouble with paper jams, but expect to pay the price when it comes to replacing the drum. All in all, this is a capable machine that produces high-quality black and white images and text.The printing speed is much faster than that of my old HP, although newer and more expensive models will have increased print speeds. I like that the paper tray can hold a whole ream of paper without jamming, and that communication between computer and printer seems reasonably efficient. Printing web pages does not take long, as I did on my HP. Best of all for me, this printer is Mac OS X compatible with no additional hardware needed; older Macs should also have no trouble. I have been able to print more than a hundred pages in one session without jamming or other issues. The print itself is high quality, as one would expect from a laser printer.I do get annoyed with the power saver feature, which I haven't yet figured out how to turn off. After approximately ten minutes of non-use, the printer turns off, requiring the user to flip the power switch off and then back on. Rebooting takes approximately 30 seconds.I give this model three stars instead of four primarily because the manual is explicit about eventually requiring drum replacement, a necessity that will cost almost as much as the printer itself. If you look at this printer as a relatively short term solution to printing high-quality black and white documents, then you will be happy.",3,"Cheap Solution, High Quality Printing",1091664000,"08 5, 2004",Debbie Lee Wesselmann,0.2008

Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast. I bought a generic memory card for $8. The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds.

7,A33ZYFE8XMKKR1,B00005MEP6,"[25, 25]","One day while strolling through Office Max on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, I stumbled across what I thought was an exceptional deal - a 1200 DPI laser printer under $200! It almost seemed too good to be true. After some initial skepticism and subsequent analysis, I realized that it was, in fact, an excellent deal - for a niche low volume user who needs fast printing.As a frequent author of reviews, I would typically check Amazon before buying such an item. So after returning to my office, printer in hand, my enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the negative reviews on the HL-1440. I almost returned it before seeing the print quality and performing some basic calculations. In the end, I am glad I kept it as it serves my need for having a fast, high quality, low volume printer in my one-man office.Currently I own a [large] microwave-sized multifunction HP inkjet (d155xi), which is at my home office. I decided that if I needed another printer in a second location, it should be a inexpensive laser printer. Initially, I thought I would purchase a $300 HP. My concern with such printers and the other sub-$500 printers was the cost of the consumables. Experience with ink-jets (such as my HP-d155xi) demonstrated that the ink expenditures are a real killer. This, of course, is a ploy by the manufacturers to recoup equipment costs via pricy consumables.The sales associate at Office Max suggested that the replacement toner cartridges last 6000 sheets for around $60. After some mental calculations, I figured that it would be a good deal. Only when I returned to read the Amazon customer reviews did I learn that there was a second consumable - the drum - that lasts, at best, 20,000 sheets. This is something I did not anticipate. While I have no way of determining if this second consumable was created for purely technical reasons or merely as a financial/marketing strategy, I would guess that it is a bit of both. Moreover, at a cost of $115 w/tax, the drum costs about 65% of the cost of a HL-1440, making a second drum purchase a psychological obstacle.To determine if the Brother HL-1440 was a good value, I opened Excel and performed some basic calculations, which you can see below.Assumptions - Drum replaced at 15,000 sheets first time; 18,000 additional sheets second time. High capacity toner lasts stated 6000 sheets, original yields 3000 sheets. Note that it doesn't come with a USB cable ($20) but I had a surplus one.$w_tax total$ total sheets _sheetprinter $176 $176 3k 5.9HC toner 1 $57 $232 9k 2.6HC toner 2 $57 $289 15k 1.9New Drum $115 $404 15kHC toner 3 $57 $461 21k 2.2HC toner 4 $57 $518 27k 1.9HC toner 5 $57 $574 33k 1.7As you can see, if you chose to toss the printer at 15,000 sheets, the average price per sheet is 1.9 cents. This is far below the cost of printing at Kinko's - excluding transportation costs and convenience value. The tricky part comes from the decision to purchase a new drum. It takes a while to recoup the cost of the drum, making it a very tough decision for some. Moreover, one has to guess how long the other components will last. Given my level of use, I would probably not purchase the drum. In the three years that it would take to wear out the first drum, another, more cost effective solution would become available.Like expectancy issues aside, there are some nice features to this printer. Print quality is excellent (as least after the first 500 pages). While somewhat lightweight compared to workgroup printers, it is built better than most inkjets I have used. Nice touches include the paper level meter where a mechanical needle on the front indicates the height of the paper reserves in the tray.Some strange problems include mirror printing from certain applications, such as MS Streets and Trips 2004. This is corrected by a patch. There is also a recurring Found New Hardware problem where it creates a new printer icon (Copy 1, 2, etc). It usually stops at copy 2. Brother suggests that this is a Windows XP problem. As I have used multiple USB printers on this and similar computers, I doubt that it is just an XP problem. In the end, it appears that a full drive uninstall may have solved this minor annoyance.In the end, I would suggest this printer is a good choice for low volume home offices or single person companies. If you are like me, someone who prints around a 100 pages per week and needs a fast printer when on deadline, the HL-1440 is a good choice. I would not recommend this for any moderate volume or workgroup environment.Pro'sExcellent print qualityVery inexpensiveLow total cost of ownership/price per pageNice paper level meterCon'sPoor front interfaceShort lifePossible driver problemsStrange printing anomalies (corrected by patches)Only 2MB memoryNo USB cabled included",4,Excellent Low Volume Printer,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",P.

8,A2013JDMPUV6D9,B00005MEP6,"[5, 5]","I have a two computer network at home in which I previously used two average quality inkjet printers (one for each pc). With laser printers having cost so much in the past, I never bothered to put one in at home. I was surprised to see that this model is not only affordable at its regular price of 99 dollars, but I found it at Office Max for 79.99 (they are no longer going to carry it)!Because I have had great success using the Brother HL5170DN at work, and because a friend has the 1440 and loves it, I decided to give the HL-1440 a try for home use. I can say without a doubt that this is one good printer. I would think that even if I had paid twice as much as I did (which makes it all the sweeter). The print speed is very fast and the quality is great. I am still impressed with how crisp and clean this machine can produce images and graphics.I am told that the toner cartridge that came with the printer (#430) is good for about 3,000 pages. By factoring that plus the cost of replacement cartridges, I feel that this printer is a fantastic choice for home use.

The toner lasts forever, the print quality is excellent, the speed is great (especially if you come to this unit from an inkjet printer), and the unit is relatively quiet. I have only one gripe with it: the design makes it really, really tough to deal with paper jams. I have found myself bent like a pretzel with a computer tweezer tool in hand, trying to find an opening through which to pick apart a piece of paper that has gotten stuck somewhere inside the printer. I'm invariably at fault for the jam, leaving something lying where it would impede the exiting of the printed sheets, causing them to back up and accordion themselves in the printer. Nightmare!!!
