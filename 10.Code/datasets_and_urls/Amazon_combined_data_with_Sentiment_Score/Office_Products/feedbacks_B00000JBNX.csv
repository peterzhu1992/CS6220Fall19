I bought this one because it was cheap, compared to the TI 83 that I wanted. I used it for 2 years before it was damaged (my fault, not a product defect).I bought a cheap calculator to replace it and have been very disappointed. I plan on getting another calculator like these before my statistics class next semester.",5,Worked great,1070582400,"12 5, 2003",-0.1197

It is not slide in / slide out cover cases like most calculators. It is more of a snap it on / snap it off.

This is the required calculator for the 6th grade here in Ohio, but I originally purchased mine for an advanced chemistry class for a top 10 university course 18 years ago. It's still the one I grab every time I need a calculator - it performs all the scientific notation that I need, and doesn't become cumbersome like the TI-83. I've used this for everything from calculus, microbiology, biochemistry to advanced chemistry and it's worked like a dream.

(Totally would have bought it on Amazon had I known about it. Every day I find more and more things to buy on Amazon with my Prime Membership, not that I'm plugging Amazon, but I love Amazon.) I also love that this shows two lines for previous entries. That was the major selling point for me for when I do my accounting online homework - my laptop computer doesn't have the numeric keys, so it's frustrating to have to use the numbers above the QWERTY keyboard, and it's also time consuming.

I've never had to use the sin, cos, and tan buttons, but one feature that is especially useful in science class is the ability to shift between scientific notation and normal notation (end, sci/eng, right, enter). It sounds more complicated than it really is and once you do it once, you'll be fine.Occasionally, there are individual calculators that will have poorly made buttons that stick a little. In that case, you have to be extra careful when inputting data, but usually this gets fixed with enough use.Conclusion: Good choice for science class.",5,Just Right for Teaching Chemistry Classes ...,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",0.5588

The design part in these pictures is all white on the calculator I received. If this is a big deal to you, you may want to go to a store where you can pick the design you want. For me the pink color met my requirements.A great basic non graphing scientific calculator at a great price. My school bookstore charges $20 for these and only has them in black. Pink makes it stand out so you know it is yours and makes doing math more fun!It is solar powered with a battery back up. It has a cover that snaps on the back when you dont need it shut, and there is a cheat sheet for the functions that is in the cover. I love Texas Instruments, they make products meant to last.

14,A1SYLII0808HD6,B00000JBNX,M. Allen Greenbaum,"[67, 72]","Main Points:I used this calculator for over 10 years before it finally stopped working, and I treated it fairly roughly (e.g.,coffe spills). I think others here have attested to the functionality of the TI-30, so I just want to emphasize that it's a tough little gadget as well. Yes, the buttons are on the small side and there is a bit of play, but this was never a major problem (although at times it slows down data entry). You can go to [...] for a good overview of TI calculators, and you can scope out one of TI's major competitors at [...]A Little History:This was also one of the first commercially available low-priced calculators that had two-line display and backspace to correct or edit data entry. The dual-power and scrolling display features were also once unusual. The top line (for data entry) shows up to 11 characters; you can scroll backwards or forwards up to 88! The bottom line (shows results) displays up to a 10-digit answer along with a 2-digit exponent.Individual Needs Differ:From the reviews here, it appears that high school math is now more difficult than it once was. If you know that you're going to need graphing capability, then obviously this is not the choice for you. Similarly, the prevalence of laptop computers and math/stats software may obviate the need for some of the more advanced features.Recommendation:The layout is very good and, for such a low price, it packs a lot of calculating might. However, high school (or college)students may want to narrow their choices and then ask their teacher which one has the most relevant functions for the next few years of math. Compared to twenty-five or so years ago, one can now get a lot more calculator for the money. Depending on your budget, therefore, you might determine that a calculator like this is sufficient for your short-term needs, but that you'll need a new one if you go on to more advanced stats and math. In any event, this is a durable calculator that works very well.",4,4 1/2 Durable and Inexpensive!,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",0.1922

I bought this one because I needed a no-frills scientific calculator for my Diff Eq class. I didn't have a lot of money to spend, so this one seemed to fit the bill. I wish I had gone to a bricks and mortar store and tried it against some other ones, though. It has all the functions I want, including storing the previous answer, but the buttons don't always register a key press. It is really frustrating to be in the middle of a test and have the calculator get temperamental. It is especially bad when I don't notice it happened and mess up a problem because the button didn't register. It's not an issue with the buttons being difficult to press, either.
