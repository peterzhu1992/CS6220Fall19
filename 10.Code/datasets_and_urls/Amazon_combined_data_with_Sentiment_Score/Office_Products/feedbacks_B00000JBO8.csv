0,AMQ1MEG334SAP,B00000JBO8,Bigmac,"[4, 11]","Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator. Apparently, TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI's Website. However, the calculator is complicated to use, and you almost need a course to learn how to use it. Furthermore, the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out. But let me assure you they are definitely there, and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead.",1,"A lot of hype, but it quickly fizzled",1159660800,"10 1, 2006",0.1551

Yes, there are better, more advanced calculators out there for the advanced mathematics and scientific user. And yes, this item should be priced much lower than it is, considering it has been on the market for a long time. However, for use in an academic setting, consider that there exists a lot of teaching materials out there in the classrooms, as well as activities, that are built around this model. So, because of that, this model has survived all this time.I bought this calculator to use in a Corporate Finance class. Calculating Time Value of Money problems with this was much easier than using the BA II Plus. The inputs are easier to enter, without having to memorize long sequences of key strokes.Your instructor and the class activities will most likely dictate which brand and model of calculator to purchase, rather than a reviewer's recommendations. However, one bit of advice I can give you is very important to remember: Please, use regular 1.5v alkaline batteries should you purchase this model. The rechargeable batteries, with their 1.2v, will not be enough to give you a clear display. A set of four batteries will last a very long time. However, it would not be a bad idea to carry a spare pack of 4 in your briefcase or backpack. You would not want to run out of battery in the middle of an important exam. This calculator, unlike the more basic models, will not run on solar power.",4,"Pricey, but versatile",1404000000,"06 29, 2014",0.3089
3,AN81JUYW2SL24,B00000JBO8,Gearhead Mania,"[27, 42]","Parents: If you're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school, DON'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator. Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college. What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs, GREs, AP tests, high school, algebra, calculus 1-3, college, etc...If you buy a TI-83, you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82, which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math, but it's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III. I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3, but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work:The TI-83 is a piece of junk. It's for kiddies in 6th grade.The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its pretty print and units system. Plus with the right software mods, you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.However I realize you're just trying to find info on the TI-83. My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is: don't bother. It's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86. It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college (Calculus I-III). A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.It's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari. It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well. The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum. It can tackle small stuff but will hold its own when the big beasts come around.",2,Baby toy calculator,1071532800,"12 16, 2003",0.2547

No matter what you will always find yourself using one of these calculators in high school, they are very powerful calculators that have a great advantage over a standard calculator because it has the ability to have programs on it and because it is a graphing calculator. These calculators can even be used during tests such as the SAT! It gives you a better advantage if you know how to use one of these well. The only downside to these calculators is that they require 4 AAA batteries, they last a pretty long time though because the screen doesn't take up much power. Some people might complain that the screen is too low resolution to today's standards or that it isn't a backlit screen, but this screen is what allows for greater battery use, you wouldn't want your calculator to power off during an exam. So although this calculator is from 1999 it is still a good calculator that you won't regret getting.I rate the TI-83 Plus 5 out of 5 stars.I hope this review helped you out!",5,A definite must have for high school students...,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",0.4807

9,A3QMJMTLJC34QC,B00000JBO8,Vincent E. Martin Darkbard,"[0, 0]","Bottom-Line: The Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful.It's time for me to head back to school, DeVry University's Keller Graduate School of Management that is. This time I am in pursuit of my MBA with a concentration in Networking and Telecommunications. Why pursue a boring ole traditional MBA when new technology is to be learned? So that means math; lots of math; loads of math in the form of algebra, calculus, and the ever dread statistics.Did I mention that I hate math!? What does one do when one hates math, but still needs to do it in spades? Buy a calculator of course, but not just any calculator I needed a calculator cable of doing complex mathematics including graphing equations. My very first course called for a Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator.Powered by (4) AAA-sized batteries (plus 1 CR-1616 or CR 1620 lithium battery for backup), the TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator is large unit ideal for advanced mathematics students high school algebra to college-level calculus, and statistics. The TI-83 Plus packs a lot of mathematical punch and the price of $127.00 (Office Depot.com) certainly confirms it.The TI-83 Plus calculator combines features for statistical analysis, engineering, trigonometric and financial functions making it ideal for a student seeking an MBA. Financial functions include TVM, cash flows and amortization, though surprisingly a percentage key is missing from the calculator.The two pound (yes, it is heavy, kind of) TI-83 Plus features a non-backlit 64x96 pixel grey scale LCD screen that is frankly hard to read unless the lighting is exactly right. But the LCD display can display graphs and tables on a full as well as split-screen. And the display exhibits up to (12) characters and eight lines. The calculator can graph/trace equations while scrolling through table values. And the TI-83 Plus can store and analyze up to 10 equations.I also purchased the optional TI-Graph Link (software and USB cable). The software and cable allows one to connect the TI-83 Plus to a computer via a USB port permitting the transfer of files and data between the two devices.My ThoughtsAmple time should be given to learning what the TI-83 Plus can bring to the table. All of the nine digits are there of course, but the face of the calculator contains a whole lot more in the form of multi-colored special function buttons; and there are a lot of them! However, the TI-83 Plus ships with very detailed, instruction manual, so I plan to carry it with me at all times.As I stated above, and it is worth restating, the TI-83 Plus's non-backlit LCD is a little difficult to read when the unit is lying flat on a desk and a lot will depend on the lighting conditions. Even with the right lighting, the top line of the display is hard to read.Though I was stunned by the high price of the unit the Texas Instruments TI-83 Plus Graphing Calculator is probably the last calculator you will purchase in your academic career, it is just that powerful. You can buy it for a high school student and (s)he can use it through graduate school.",4,The Quintessential Mathematic/Scientific Calculator,1294876800,"01 13, 2011",0.1114
