4,A2BWY08L8HCXH8,B00005T407,D Chantry Gilbert,"[2, 2]","This simple calculator seems to work fine, as advertized. I docked it a star because I wasn't able to find a function for integrations or higher order functional analysis, but I suppose you can't have everything in a five dollar calculator.It also lacks voice control, has little or no artificial intelligence, and in general makes a very poor companion if you're stuck alone with it on a desert island. It does break the ice at parties with the classic 58008 joke, but only the most sophisticated of users are able to appreciate the humor.",4,No Scientific Functions; Also Can't Fly,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",0.0662

7,A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B00005T407,K. Groh,"[2, 2]","My 4th grader was told that they could use calculators in class. She didn't like the ones provided by the school but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something that could easily get lost or broken. She wanted a fancy, fun calculator but none of them had good reviews and she really didn't need a toy on her desk.So I picked this up for her for three reasons:1. It has a built in cover, perfect for keeping it safe in a backpack2. It is solar and battery powered - double the options3. It was the perfect price at less than $3!It works well, is small enough for a desk and easy enough to read.",5,Can't Beat it for the Price!,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",0.2691

9,AKWA0KM0C6WOO,B00005T407,LPN78,"[0, 0]",This is a small and cheap calculator. The price is low and you get what you pay for. It serves its purpose and was inexpensive so I have no complaints.,4,ok,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",0.0015
10,A38VQ2TIPPBKNN,B00005T407,Sir Charles Panther Life is hard. It's hard...,"[55, 56]","The best thing about this calculator is that it's got a cover that latches. No, it doesn't lock, but that little hard-plastic door closes over the keypad, so when I toss it into my briefcase and head out, I don't have to worry about damage to the keypad, or the thing being turned on and staying on as a stray pen or something just keeps pushing its buttons. The main power source is light, but it's got a simple battery backup, the batteries being accessible when you pull two small philips-head screws from the back of the case.This thing is small and mobile, and is perfect for my mobile business needs. I'm not going to be plotting spacecraft trajectories or formulating amino acid degradations today, so I don't need anything more than the basic arithmetic functions it offers (as well as %, square root and basic memory functions).The buttons are just the right size, not so big that I feel like this thing is a learning toy for a 2 year old, or has been made for the myopic over-70 set. The buttons are big enough that I can quickly tap out my work without mashing down multiple buttons.To conclude, if you want a small calc you can tote with you and that will not let you down by running out of power, this is the one. If you're after a reliable little machine to crank out your daily checkbook totals or to tally up the pro-rating on your timesheet entries, then this is the one you want.

11,A2DJFYBB2L5VSN,B00005T407,UniversityDoc,"[0, 0]","Nice useful calculator. Not as nice as the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator, which I really like, it is great just the same. It has a hard case that protects the calculator from regular use or putting in one's pocket or briefcase. It goes off when you close the case. It is a good size to use on the go or on your desk. Looking for a handy durable calculator, I think this will fit the tbill. More so, the Casio SL-300 Wallet Style Pocket Calculator will be even better. See my other review.",4,Handy little calculator.,1341878400,"07 10, 2012",0.3545
