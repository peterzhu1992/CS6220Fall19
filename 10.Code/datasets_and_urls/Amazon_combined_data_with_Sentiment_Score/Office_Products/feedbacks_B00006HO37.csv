1,AU1R53DYGA7OI,B00006HO37,A for Amazon,"[0, 0]","Measure carefully because I did not. Yes, the outside measurement of the stand is 14-1/2 inches, but my laptop is also 14-1/2 inches, so rather than sitting on the desk below my monitor, it sits on the legs of the stand. This means I need to be very careful with the docking station so it seats in properly. But the stand looks nice and will do for now.",4,Measure carefully,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",0.2848
2,A2JAEZ0FMAMJVW,B00006HO37,A. H.,"[0, 0]","This is a basic stand for a monitor. It's just a curved metal tube with a metal plate affixed to the top. The first one I got was defectively assembled -- the metal plate on top was crooked, badly out of square. I returned it, and the replacement is much better.The color is a sort of metallic black. There is a gray Allsop logo painted on in raised letters on the front right part of the tube.It gets the job done and looks decent enough.",4,OK stand.

3,A3872Y2XH0YDX1,B00006HO37,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","For the last few years, I've been using my Subwoofer as a monitor stand and decided it was time to man-up and buy a monitor stand. I found this one (and a few of the others) and decided on the pewter colored stand, and I love it.Don't expect this monitor stand to push you to the edge of life, or anything, but it's a good stand. It's also a nice bonus that I can set my keyboard directly underneath the stand.",5,"This is a great stand, but the picture is not accurate.",1325116800,"12 29, 2011",0.4991
4,AI5OS4RQQIUMJ,B00006HO37,Amy S.,"[124, 124]","If you own a laptop and use an external LCD monitor or you are just looking to sneak some small peripherals or desk accessories beneath your monitor or an inkjet printer, look no further. The MetalArt Jr. is a classy alternative to molded plastic stands intended for beafier CRT monitors. I ordered the product to use as a stand for a 17&quot; LCD monitor. Not only does it raise the monitor to the ideal height, but it is spaced perfectly to store my IBM T40 laptop and docking station neatly beneath. The perforated metal at the top of the stand allows air to flow freely and keeps both the laptop and monitor cool.The description doesn't give the dimensions of the stand, which are very important since its size is not traditional, so I'll list them here (from the manufacturer): 11&quot; x 15&quot; x 4.5&quot;.",5,Attractive and functional,1073001600,"01 2, 2004",0.3493
5,A2F1P10GGZ7K2T,B00006HO37,Erik1988,"[5, 6]","The item holds my new 22 inch LCD just fine.It doesn't bounce and shake if knocked, so the monitor is nice and safe.We bought three and all three came with cheap, sloppy paint jobs. So to match my all black computer I spray painted them and it looks like I bought it that way.The space under is perfect for my Logitech Wave Keyboard to slid out of the way or a nice place to throw those pads of sticky notes, pens and whatnots.OVERALL:We've bought one for all three family members and its been great to gain some desk space and ensure we are more ergonomic by having the monitor at the correct hight for the desk/chair setup. Its the cheapest metal unit I could find and it holds up under the weight just fine.",4,functional and nice looking . . .after I painted it,1225756800,"11 4, 2008",0.5583

Now my main monitor sits on a large one, and the tablet sits on the smaller one - enabling me to make use of both screens - and it opens up space below the monitors for other office items.",5,Perfect Monitor Stand,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",0.0

8,A3IRA0BHI9NE9U,B00006HO37,Justin Quigley Justin Quigley,"[0, 0]",I bought about 14 of these for 17-23 inch monitors. They hold up nice and also look nice.

The stand is perfectly stable, and the pewter is a neutral dark silver that does look like the Amazon picture.The stand is wide enough to store a ream of paper underneath, as well as smaller stacks of photo paper. Very pleased with the usefulness of this stand.",5,Works perfectly with home printer,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",0.6514

11,A34IYW7VLUKTOM,B00006HO37,Matthew Franzel,"[0, 1]","I needed more space for digital devices. I have a laser printer and needed a place to put the office scanner I just purchased. This fits perfectly on top of the printer without making the printer unusable. The paper comes out of the printer and the scanner sits right on top of this awesome device.The stand is metal and very sturdy. It can easily hold an old CRT monitor... though, who even has one nowadays?It is marketed as a monitor stand, but you can (obviously) use it wherever you want and put whatever you want on it.",5,It is what it is... and it is great!,1334966400,"04 21, 2012",0.362

15,A2Y3WWPUKIJ59I,B00006HO37,Veil_Lord,"[1, 1]","I got this as a stand for my PS2 Slim. I was worried about generated heat and this metal stand makes a great heat sink. It's even got holes in it that add even more ventilation. I now have room to store my controllers under the system so as a space saver alone it was worth the nominal price. This is the cheapest monitor stand of reasonable quality I have found.It would also make a very nice stand with passive cooling for your laptop, if you were typing on a coffee table that's lower than the couch you're sitting on. Set on a normal desk, its height would be a bit cumbersome to type on, unless you hooked up an external keyboard.Be clear, this *will not* support much weight. The whole missing front support is a design is flaw in my opinion. However, if you're using it for something light it's great. The color isn't as nice looking as the picture would lead you to believe, but I really don't care.",4,Great for my PS2 system.,1246406400,"07 1, 2009",0.1092
