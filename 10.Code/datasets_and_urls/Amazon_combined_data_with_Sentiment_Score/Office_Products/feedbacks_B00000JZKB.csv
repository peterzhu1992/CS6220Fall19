This is helpful for those taking introductory courses in Accounting and also in Finance. You can also use this to check your Excel spreadsheet and make sure that your formulas are correct. This can be especially helpful when setting up an amortization table. However, if your teacher will allow it, you may be better off with a graphing calculator, like a Ti-83. You can use the Ti-83's TVM functions to do the same things, and it is a little bit easier to learn.Another thing to consider, for those who will be taking exams, is that you will need to master the functions of whatever model calculator will be allowed on the test. While I prefer the TI-83, it may not be allowed in the CPA Exam, for example.",5,Standard tool for the business student,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",0.4557

Salotti DS,"[0, 0]","I got this calculator at request from my Corporate Finance professor.Its the student version and pretty easy to use -- key thing being that you regularly clear your work from memory in between TVM problems.Once you get the hang of it, its very fast to calculate PV, NPV, FV, Cost of Capital, etc.Its not as solidly made as the TI-85's I had in Calc as an undergrad, but its small, lightweight and easy to use --- worth the 28$ and actually a bit quicker to solve finance problems than MS Excel(Note: for real world NPVs, I do use Excel since thats more repetitive work and involves alot of different scenario modeling that would be less efficient on a manual calculator.)",4,Easy to use - good calculator for Finance Classes,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",0.9046

8,A3MAFS04ZABRGO,B00000JZKB,Let it Be Alan,"[7, 7]","VALUE PERFORMER GETS NEW LOOKBA2+ users may like to know that Texas Instruments has released a new look TI BA2+ (allow me to call it it BA2+N), which may come with just more than cosmetic improvements over the popular BA2+.IMPROVED LCD DISPLAYI was able to observed from a short distant away that the LCD display of the BA2+N,is clearer and more contrasty than the orginal BA2+ which I own. TI gets a thumbs up for doing this improvement quietly plus giving a facelift to this already highly regarded value for money business-financial electronic calculator.DID TEXAS INSTRUMENT KILLED SOME BUGS IN THE BA2+?Although I have not yet been able to test the BA2+N, TI may have also incorporated some improvements and killed some bugs on the popular BA2+. It is also probable that some improvements or new functions incorporated on the September 2004 released BA2+ Professional (BA2+PRO) may also have been also incorporated into the specs of BA2+N.I would like to believe that some small but extremely annoying bugs of the original BA2+ has been quietly fixed on the BA2+N. In particular, I wish to see the Reset button nuisance which clears all user input formatting on the BA2+ has been done alway with. Most users of BA2+ would know that an accident user soft reset would return to the default Number of Periods per year P/Y to 12, this would upset the results of many TVM calculations when user has set the P/Y to 1 to use the calculator in number of periods instead.BATTERY REPLACEMENT WOES ON THE BA2+I was not able to exam a unit of the BA2+N to see if end users would still need a screw driver to unscrew and pry open the BA2+ casing just to replace the CR2032 battery. It would be nice if TI would incorporate a user accessible slide open battery compartment for the BA2+N or future upgrades of the BA2+.MY RECOMMENDATIONWould be buyers should get hold of the BA2+N or buy the BA2+PRO if you have a bigger budget. Budget conscious users could see that for the price of a BA2+ PRO, a screw driver and spare batteries, new users could afford to purchase for themselves two sets of BA2+N.An advantage of having a spare BA2+N set on hand is that users could free themselves from the trouble of carrying a philips screwdriver and replacement lithium batteries to important assignments or to the examination centre.HOW DIFFERENT DOES THE BA2+N LOOKS? I have downloaded the BA2+N JPEG picture from TI's calculator site and posted it to the Amazon's picture gallery.IMPORTANT NOTE:I have commented on the BA2+N as an end user and I don't work for TI, HP or any of the manufacturers for the products which I have used, reviewed and posted my comments on the pages of Amazon.com. It is my pleasure to be able to share my first look at the BA2+N with you, thanks for reading!",4,A first look at the New Look TIBA2+,1109462400,"02 27, 2005",0.3182

10,A2PQUL8TI4P4HV,B00000JZKB,Nakkiel,"[0, 0]","I had gotten my first TI calculator in 6th or 7th grade. My TI-83+ has survived about 10 years of being dropped, thrown in frustration, left in hot/cold cars, etc. I bought this calculator for a finance class so that I could enter the calculations I need as they are taught in class rather than figuring it out on my graphing calculator. The first thing I noticed are the keys aren't nearly as good and are kind of annoying to press. The case isn't very solid at all, I get the feeling if I were to drop it that would be the end of this calculator. As for actual calculation it has been fine so far, but you need to change decimal settings. Out of box it rounds to 2 places, which is inadequate. I recommend setting it to 5.",4,"Good, not the greatest build quality.",1354233600,"11 30, 2012",-0.1069
11,A2FIC05DY3HT7J,B00000JZKB,Philster Philster,"[0, 0]","This is a good calculator as would be expected from Texas Instruments, who have been in the calculator business for decades. A calculator should do the functions that it is supposed to do, which this calculator does. However, like several other's have noted, the keys can be a challenge. I've had to start over after entering a number due to the numbers not enterring as they should have. A good press of the keys takes care of that issue, but most calculators do not need to have the keys pressed firmly for the correct operation... If Texas Instruments could redesign around the key issue, this would be a five star calculator, as the case and display are well designed. I have only used this calculator for a total of maybe 15 - 20 hours, and the keys may work better over time, but I have not seen any change during the timeframe noted.Update 6/16/11 - I'm hoping that I ended up with a lemon, and that this is not an indicator of TI's quality standards. I'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars. The decimal button works only when pressed firmly as do several other buttons on this calculator. When taking a timed test in a finance class, this calculator really failed me because of these issues. Even being aware of the issues with the calculator I found myself having to redo calculations several times for most of the problems due to the calculator not taking the decimal point. In over thirty years of using calculators I have never had one with issues like this. At this point, I'd only recommend this calculator to my enemies, not my friends.",2,"Lacks in quality, not Texas Instruments finest calculator...",1305763200,"05 19, 2011",0.0935

13,ACGTYE5R2EXVF,B00000JZKB,S. Gerber samthewebman,"[13, 16]","I have owned two TI Business Analyst calculators in the past. One finally broke after many years and I replaced it with this one.The functions provided are extremely useful for so many calculations, like the monthly payback on a loan, what the future value of a series of payments into an IRA would yield at some assumed interest rate, discounting a future sum of money by an assume inflation rate, and many other calculations like converting a stated interest rate to a true annual rate and vice-versa and figuring the yield to maturity of a bond. You name it.A VERY useful book comes with the package, better than the book with my last one because it shows clear examples of how to perform different calculations. It will also suggest some things you can do with the calculator that you may not have intended.The calculator is encased in a protective plastic cover that removes from the calcuator and can be either placed to the side or slid onto the bottom of the case to avoid losing it. The keypad has good feedback, nice feel.The only negative, and this is a nit, is that there's no battery hatch. You have to take the case apart to replace the coin battery. I don't know why they've done that but the batteries last so long (5 years?) this shouldn't be an issue.I've seen HP and Sharp financial calculators and in my view considering the TI's price, ease of use, and terrific manual, it's a real winner!",5,Very useful for loan calculations and retirement planning!,1063065600,"09 9, 2003",0.2533
