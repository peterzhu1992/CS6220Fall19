3,A1VQHH85U7PX0,B00004Z47L,MyBeesWax A Music Fan,"[7, 9]","I bought the Scotch Double Sided Tape to put up posters. I'm very happy with how well it works. The adhesive on both sides of the tape is very strong, so the tape will hold very well.It is almost completely see-through despite being coated with adhesive on both sides of the tape. This makes it ideal on clear plastic where it should be almost invisible.The length of tape is only 250 (6.3 m) long, so these are pretty expensive! Apart from the price, the Scotch Double Sided Tape is perfect.",5,Strong Double-Sided Adhesive Tape,1245024000,"06 15, 2009",0.5444
