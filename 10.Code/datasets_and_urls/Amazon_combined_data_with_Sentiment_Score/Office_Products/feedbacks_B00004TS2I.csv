But it was a good idea. I love this paper. It is matte without too much of a rough texture and then tones are fantastic.,5,A good deal.,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",0.3306
1,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,B00004TS2I,atmj,"[25, 26]","MATTE WAS MY PREFERENCE IN TRADITIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY:It has always been my preference to have pictures done on a matte medium. While using traditional pictures especially if you like I did switched to the APS format, you could no longer get a matte finish. Since I have gone digital, the only papers, that I have seen have been glossy, so this was a pleasant surprise.A CO-WORKER WHO IS ALSO A PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER, INTRODUCED ME TO THIS PAPER:Knowing I used many reams of paper in glossy prints but really liked matte, a co-worker told me of this matte finish ink jet paper and showed me a photo he had done. Wow! He had the Epson 890 like I did, so I had to run out and get some of this amazing paper. His daughter in the photo, was wearing a red dress and it was amazing in depth of color.MY TEST SHOTS WERE PHENOMENAL:I was not dissappointed in the results. Though I have used it only on a couple of shots (I consider my test shots), I was amazed at the crispness of the photo. Only time will tell how well it lasts. I plan to subject some to the ultimate test (for me) hung on my office wall without a frame. I'll write back and tell you how it did.NO GLARE MEANS THE PICTURE JUMPS RIGHT OUT AT YOU:What I particularly like about matte pictures is the lack of glare. You don't have to get the right angle to view it. Also there is almost a 3D effect since you don't see the surface of the paper to make it flat. That is really nice.MATTE IS CHEAPER THAN GLOSSY:Matte paper at 50 pages per sheet cost also about the same of 20 sheets of glossy paper.. That too is a good thing.",5,"Wow, ultracool",1016236800,"03 16, 2002",0.3246
2,A281T8MXBOSWY5,B00004TS2I,granger,"[9, 10]","I've used Epson's Premium Glossy, Colorlife and Heavyweight Matte. The Matte is far cheaper and gives beautiful results. I've actually found that I like the Matte best for framing. It has a less reflective surface and looks more 'arty' than photographic. But I wouldn't recommend it for architectural, detailed photographs. A good benefit of both the Matte and Colorlife is that they have the longest rated life without fading of any paper for use with Epson's dye based printers.",5,price AND performance,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",0.281
3,A1EKSETIBS9ETQ,B00004TS2I,,"[5, 5]","Epson makes great printer papers. I use Epson's matte paper almost as much as the regular inkjet paper. This paper is made for color presentation and graphic. I print out my portfolio and sample work with matte paper because it is relatively cheap to the high quality printout. I use the Epson 820 and the color print matches the monitor colors (98%) almost perfect.For photo prints it is fine, but photos are simultaneous with glossy texture. If you like glossy photo then this is not the photo paper you would get. The colors do not jump at you nor have sharp deferential qualities that glossy can produce. Printing plain texts without color might be too wasteful (costly) for matte paper. I considered Epson the best in paper qualities over Canon, HP, Kodak and others for the quality/price. I have switched to the Canon i960 and am still using Epson's paper. It is that versatile. I tend to use the harder to find Epson double-side matte paper.",5,Best for presentation/graphic printout,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",0.1353
4,A3RFNCMOL3FSE8,B00004TS2I,MLouise,"[7, 7]","When I want a matte paper that is lighter weight than the really heavy photo papers but heavier than the standard grade presentation paper, this is what I use. It produces photos that are crisp and vibrant. There is a lighter version of this, the Epson Presentation Paper, Matte. It produces exactly the same quality prints if you want an even lighter paper than this. I have both versions, this one is 44 lb, the lighter weight version is 27 lb.If you are doing something that requires a little more stiffness to your project, this would work great. If you just need great quality prints on a fairly light paper, go with the 27 lb version.One final note, these are NOT for two sided printing. The back side is a darker shade, and does not have the smooth finish. If you print on the back by mistake it will not turn out well. If I'm working in dim lighting I need to hold a back against a front so I can tell the difference for when I load my printer.",5,"Works Great, Beautiful Prints.",1293408000,"12 27, 2010",0.1551

It makes VERY clear original prints, which then are used to make color copies for our members. Much better than printing on regular inkjet paper. Also, I use it for printing pictures taken in the classroom. The students can cut and mount their pictures when doing writing projects.",5,Clear Prints,1167782400,"01 3, 2007",0.254
