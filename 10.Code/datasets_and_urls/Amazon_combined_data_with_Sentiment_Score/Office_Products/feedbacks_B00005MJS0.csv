I had tested the Epson Photo paper, and found it to be superior in quality to the HP premium paper that I had used for Photos, so I figured perhaps I needed to go with better paper for my basic printing as well. Made a huge difference. Text looks wonderful on it. Paper is a nice thickness and doesn't feel as flimsy as most generic papers. It should...afterall, it's roughly double the price of bargain paper. But when you're looking to print something and have it look nice, better to go with good quality paper",5,You get what you pay for,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",0.4076
1,A3JUHP1E3WUHEA,B00005MJS0,Dr. Stuart Gitlow,"[2, 2]","I typically use Boise X9 Bright 20lb paper in both my laser and inkjet printers. This Epson product is ever so slightly heavier. I barely notice it, but for two sided printing, the 24lb paper is an improvement as you don't see the print as easily on the other side of the page. I also notice that it is somewhat brighter in shade and smoother, allowing for the inkjet to do a better job with fine print. For regular black type, the laser still outperforms the appearance of even the best inkjets, but since so much of our work has color these days, it's nice to find an inexpensive solution for at least the paper side of the equation. This is a step up from basic copy paper, but it's not such a step up that anyone will say, &#34;Oooo...nice paper.&#34;Watch for a good price, as the price varies from $5 to $10 for 500 sheets.",4,Just right for standard inkjet output,1354838400,"12 7, 2012",0.5664

It is thick enough to not easily tear like ultra-thin rice papers, etc. and the quality of print, at least with Epson ink at the highest quality setting, is better than other papers of this weight. The cost is actually not bad, all things considered.",5,"If you want a thin ink jet paper, this is it.",1384992000,"11 21, 2013",0.2498
6,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005MJS0,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[5, 5]","I recently tried this paper to use with my HP inkjet printer that is about two years old. I am very impressed. In fact, this multipurpose 108 brightness paper (yes, that's what they advertise, 108 brightness) by Epson gives you something to sing about! I use this paper with my inkjet printers; and I can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring! Actually, it's good for just about anything I need to print with my inkjet printer, including intense colors or artwork from a webpage that I want to keep in printed form for my records. The paper may buckle ever so slightly if you have to print a large square, circle or rectangular shape in a single color; but this buckling isn't too noticeable.In addition, this paper practically never jams in my printer at home. Nevertheless, I always fan the paper to make extra certain that it doesn't jam. After I fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper aren't stuck to each other, then I place it in my inkjet printer tray.Each page is a clean cut 8 inches by 11 inches. Great! Although they don't say this, I would imagine that this paper can also be used in copiers, plain paper fax machine and maybe even in laser printers. If you want to use this paper with laser printers, print out a test page or two before you buy several reams.This paper never goes stale, so stock up on it if you can catch a sale on it. As of this writing, the Amazon price seems a bit high so check with Amazon to make sure that the above price is correct.In any event, this is excellent paper; and I highly recommend this product.",5,excellent paper for inkjets and maybe even more--check the price before you buy it !!!,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",0.3944
