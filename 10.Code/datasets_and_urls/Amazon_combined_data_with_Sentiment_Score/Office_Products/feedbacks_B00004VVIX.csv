0,A1T1YSCDW0PD25,B00004VVIX,A. Wiersch,"[8, 8]","I really like this label maker. I also have another similar model. The only bad thing I have to say about this is the tapes are expensive and can be hard to find. This unit also comes with a shorter starter cartridge instead of a regular one. I couldn't find the black on white tape on Amazon.com (sold by Amazon.com), but unless you label a lot the tapes will probably last awhile. I also like the QWERTY keyboard on this unit.UPDATE 2008-12-30:Batteries: I just bought a PT-80. The PT-65 uses 6 AA batteries while the PT-80 only uses 4 AAA batteries. I think the 6 AA battery requirement for the PT-65 is a bit much, especially if you don't print that many labels (like me). One or two of the batteries (Rayovac Alkaline) in my PT-65 ended up leaking.Another minor issue may be the amount of blank tape at each end of the label seems a but wasteful and excessive.I think I will like my new PT-80 even more, so check into that model.",4,Nice little machine,1148860800,"05 29, 2006",0.1162

It was cheap and since I didn't think I would be using it for a long term I would try it. I did buy several replacement tapes at the time ( I was positive I would not be able to get any in 6 months) Well it is at least 10 years, The machine works as well as it did new and labels are still available. If I had a need for one I would not hesitate spending what they are asking for this one. A trick I've learned is to run the front of the tape gently across your thumb and a dull knife then flip the label over and with a bit more pressure run the tape on the paper side. Like curling ribbon, but not as much pressure. It works like magic. Any stiff, smooth, straight edge will do. If you are in need of one of these I highly recommend this one. I have gone through about 25 tapes, the cutter still works like it is supposed to. I'm not sure how many labels you can get out of a refill but they seem to last forever. I just popped the last one in my machine, so I am replacing my stock. I will only buy 2 this time because they seem to be available. I will look to brother the next time I need a machine that they make. I am no longer angry about the 6 month old typewriter I couldn't get a ribbon for 30 years ago lol.",5,has instilled my faith in brother products,1380067200,"09 25, 2013",0.1797
2,A35IX2GE0VC0JP,B00004VVIX,FirePepper Red firepepper red,"[33, 33]","I bought this model over others mainly because of its low price (I paid $10 bucks with no rebate hassles). It turned out to be a decent buy but it becomes obvious that the low inital price will eventually be offset by the high price of label cartridges.*** Plus Points Include ***- Easy to use though you will have to read the short manual to understand how to change the font, print size, etc.- Decent size that is portable yet still highly usable- Good quality print with a reasonable amount of fonts and borders- Replacement cartridges have a variety of colored labels to chose from.*** Negative points are: ***- It does not take laminated labels so the labels are for indoor use only.- The labels are always printed with a huge gap at the beginning and end so it wastes a lot of label space (and thus it eats up label cartridges).- The batteries are a real pain to remove because they are staggered on top of each other- If you print 2 line lables you cannot change the fonts or size- As other users have mentioned, it is not easy to separate the label from its backing.All in all this is not a bad label maker for people who need something cheap and easy for the occasional label or 2 but if you are obsessive-compulsive or need to print a ton of labels you are probably better off spending a few bucks more on something that wastes less of its label cartridge.",3,Decent features for the price but gets expensive in the long run,1148688000,"05 27, 2006",0.0939
3,A2PK64OVZA1U8Z,B00004VVIX,Jakester,"[11, 12]","This little baby works great for labeling just about anything. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, the print options are pretty good for an inexpensive machine, and print quality is superb. The only thing keeping this from garnering 5 stars is the printed label backing. Although it sticks great to just about anything, it can sometimes be a challenge to remove the backing from the tape.",4,Excellent tool.,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",0.5518
4,A14DNCG5WHM86Z,B00004VVIX,Jennifer,"[0, 0]","I love my label-maker and can't imagine life without it. I label Rubbermaid totes, charging cables, A/V equipment, boxes, leftovers for the freezer, etc...and the tape always sticks to everything. The only thing I don't like is the wasted space before and after the printed text, but it's not enough to keep me from giving this baby five stars.I love the QWERTY keyboard. There's enough variety in printing (sizes, special characters, outlines, etc.) to keep things interesting, and it's fairly easy to understand without having to resort to the instructions each time. That said, I'm fairly bland with it and pretty much use one or two main settings all the time.",5,I can't imagine life without this labeler!,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",0.503
5,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,B00004VVIX,Joanna Daneman,"[8, 8]","I have had this labeller for several years, and never had the label tape bind up. The unit is easy to use--hitting the function keys allows you to change print size, and there is a cutter on the side to dispense the label when printed. The previous entry stays on the screen for printing multiple copies. It's a useful device for labeling food bags in the freezer, making file folder labels, and any number of things that I used to label with the old embossing type label tape. The batteries seem to last plenty long (it takes AA's.) No complaints here, priceworthy and works well.",4,Works flawlessly,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",0.2424
6,A3TB9HNQR54B5V,B00004VVIX,John John,"[202, 205]","We owned another labeler made by Dymo and were not very happy with it. The keys were laid out alphabetically rather than QWERTY style and typing felt unnatural. We also could not find any store that carried blank label cartridges - even the store we bought it from (Best Buy) didn't. We had to order them directly from the manufacturer and probably paid more than we needed to.Although the old labeler still works, we decided to purchase this one. It is a much better product. The keypad is easy to use and the unit has some great features built into it. I like the fact that you can change fonts, or frames and can print on a variety of colors. The labels seem to stick much better than the Dymo brand labels we used before. They adhere to surfaces that I couldn't get cellophane tape to stick to. Almost every office supply or electronic store seems to sell the label cartridges in several colors and sizes.I only have two negative comments about this unit. First, sometimes it is hard to peel the back off of the label. You have to try to get your fingernail or similar object between the backing and the label and this is often difficult to do. Second, it needs SIX AA batteries to run. If you print a lot of labels you're going to be buying a lot of batteries. I wish that they could have designed it to run off of an AC power source also.Despite these negatives, I think that this is great product. It works well, is compact, and is reasonably priced.",4,"Compact, versatile and easy to use.",983404800,"03 1, 2001",0.1381
7,A36MS27KAA5S26,B00004VVIX,Katherine Berry of Housewife How-To's,"[30, 31]","My husband bought this so he could label his files at work (since even HE can't usually read his own writing). One day, he brought it home so he could print labels while watching TV. Silly man. I started using it to make labels, and he's never been able to get it away from me.In the kids' rooms, I used it to label toy shelves and drawers so that even my pre-schooler knew where to put away his clean clothes. That was almost a year ago, and the labels have stayed in place through countless grubby fingers grabbing at them, as well as countless times I've scrubbed away at the marks those grubby fingers leave.In the kitchen, I didn't stop at labeling cannisters or jars. I labeled drawers, shelves and cupboards, too! Now, neither my husband nor the kids have an excuse to avoid emptying the dishwasher, because they know where everything goes! As in the kids' rooms, the labels have stayed put and held up to repeated cleanings.In the guest room, where the lightswitch operates three separate lights and a ceiling fan, I labeled the switch plate so my guests don't have to waste time flipping switches to find the one they want to turn on or off. Numerous visitors have commented on how helpful this has been, particularly when they're groggy in the morning.Of course, it's been essential in the storage room where clearly-written labels have saved us hours of hunting around in boxes and bins. I even labeled spots on my husband's tool bench. Now when I borrow a pair of pliers or screwdriver he's no longer complaining that I don't return it to the right place.This product is sturdy, too. My 5-year-old has taken a turn printing up labels and yanking out the tape. Although the tape has jammed in there a few times when he's done this (and I'm fairly certain any label-maker's tape would do the same thing), it's been a cinch to get straightened out. It's even survived being dropped on the floor a number of times.I am impressed, and I'm also addicted to this thing. Naturally, my friends and family members all teased me over my addicition... until I gave them each one. Now they're addicts, too!",5,Infinite Variety Of Uses,1133481600,"12 2, 2005",0.1838
8,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,B00004VVIX,K. Fontenot Prairie Cajun Regenerated!,"[4, 4]","The PT-65 has become a lifesaver in my workplace. Since I work with Nortel phone systems, life can get pretty wild when you have a load of phones to punch down on blocks that go to different wings of a building. I carry the PT-65 with me to new job sites and label each punch-down block so that I can easily keep track of what goes where. Also, the labels look very professional when placed on folders in the office.Overall, this labeler is quite easy to use and very convenient to carry around from job to job. I'm sure it works great with computers, filing systems, and even baseball card collections as well.",4,Easy And Convenient,1103155200,"12 16, 2004",0.4173
9,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B00004VVIX,Noname,"[1, 1]","This is a nice labeler. I got it as a present more than a year ago and have found that it has so many uses. I label everything with it. I can choose different type styles and sizes. I can underline and choose a frame. I can even check the length of the label before I print it.The labels are waterproof. I've labeled ice packs that I keep in the freezer and send to school with my kids. I've also labeled food containers that end up in the dishwasher. The labels do not come off when wet, not even in the dishwasher.There are so many uses for this labeler. It's a great buy.",5,A great little labeler.,1233014400,"01 27, 2009",0.1046
