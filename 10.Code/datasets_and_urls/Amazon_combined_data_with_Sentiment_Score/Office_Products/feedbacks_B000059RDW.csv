The issue is that the printer still says the cartridge is good when it is depositing a grey background on everything you print !",5,"Good, but never as claimed !",1352160000,"11 6, 2012",0.2627

It tooks several years. I had bought a spare toner cartridge in anticipation with the printer, and it sat on a shelf for years. I fully expect it to last another couple of years.",5,I must be the odd one here,1121558400,"07 17, 2005",0.0257
2,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B000059RDW,Kate McMurry,"[16, 26]","I have owned the Brother HL-1240 Laser Printer about a year now. I have no quarrels with the printer itself, but the cartridges are a real pain.The first four cartridges I used the 3000-copy cartridge. They ran out really quickly, so I shifted to the TN-560 6000-copy cartridge.Here is the amount of copies I got on the four 3000-copy cartridges: 2000, 2500, 2500, 1900.This is the performance I've gotten on the first two TN-560 600-copy cartridges I've used: 4600 and ****2500***!!! For the latter, a black line appeared on the right side of the page after 2500 copies, making the cartridge useless, even though it still had ink.Tip for getting more copies from these Brother toner cartridges: you can often get an additional 300-500 copies after the red light on the printer starts blinking, indicating you need to change the toner. But it is very irritating having that light blink all the time.I am trying to figure out who I should complain to about these very poor product.... every single toner cartridge I've bought from them so far vastly under-performs--up to 40%--on the number of copies promised by Brother.",2,Does NOT deliver the amount of copies the company promises,996278400,"07 28, 2001",-0.2873

I've been totally satisfied with my old reliable Brother printer and I've never tried to save a few shekels by using toner or related products that weren't Brother products.
