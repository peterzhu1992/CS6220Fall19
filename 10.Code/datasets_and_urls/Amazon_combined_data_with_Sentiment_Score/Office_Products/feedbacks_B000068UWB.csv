0,A27HJBFDSTFVFG,B000068UWB,A. Marbach badgroove,"[0, 0]","This paper was not really of the high quality standards I have come to expect from Mead products in the past. While it is fine for it's intended purpose and useable I find the thickness of the paper to be extremely thin and the lines on the backside of some of the pages from this pack were so faded I had trouble seeing them. Honestly, I expected better.",2,Not really the high quality I expect from Mead,1400803200,"05 23, 2014",0.1611

The paper is thin but it has never torn. He does only use one side, but that is his preference, and his teachers find that easier to mark too.Would definitely buy again.",5,Get what you pay for,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",0.2701

Program participants must show that the raw material in their supply chain comes from legal and responsible. As long as you are going to use paper, you might as well be responsible.I have atrocious handwriting. So atrocious that I have reverted mostly to block printing versus Script. My second problem is keeping an even line on the page. This Mead Filler Paper, College Ruled, 200 Sheets (15326) solves my mind problem. Just a note the ruling is on both sides of the page.I cannot speak to bleed through on calligraphy inks; I use a gel ball pen and there is no bleed through whatsoever.I suggest you buy several of these packs as you will be surprised how quick you go through the pages.",5,SFI Sustainable Forestry Initiative - Certified Sourcing,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",-0.054

I didn't know what that is so I googled it. It's a responsible forestry organization.

5,A3T1LD0C65QCWK,B000068UWB,Gordon M. Wagner,"[0, 0]","The thing is, I expect paper in North America to be 8 1/2 x 11, NOT a smaller size. Which is what this filler paper is. It's decent quality, maybe 16# paper, which is acceptable, no excess weight and not ultra-thin and ultra-cheap paper which feels impoverished and low-grade. The holes are cleaned drilled, the edges are crisp. The lines are a bit weak, and I'm comparing this filler paper to the &#34;TOPS Notebook Filler Paper, College Ruled, 11 x 8.5 Inches, 3-Hole Punched, Medium Weight, White, 500 Sheets/Pack (62349)&#34; I've been buying for my kids the past few years. The TOPS paper is ***full size*** which is a big deal to me. The paper weight is about equal to the Mead Filler Paper. The holes and page trim and equally clean. The printed lines, the greenish horizontal and the red vertical, are stronger than the Mead paper.This is good filler paper, but if I were you I'd buy the TOPS Notebook Filler Paper instead, mostly because it's full sized 8 1/2 x 11 and also because the printing of the lines (&#34;rules&#34;) is stronger.",3,Undersize,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",0.1686

It is also dense enough not to allow bleed-through of liquid ink pens.

7,A1D7VWS3DWS7X8,B000068UWB,Joseph Siegler,"[1, 1]","I guess I remember what these packs of paper were like when I was in school (which was some years ago now). I remember them being thicker than this, but it's not like the product I got was too thin. I saw another review saying you can't write on both sides of the paper with ink. I wouldn't go quite that far, but it is a bit &#34;thinnish&#34;.Still, having said that it is what it is. A pack of paper that you can put in your binder and write stuff on. It's fine. Makes great paper airplanes, too. :)",4,"A little thin, but not super thin",1400716800,"05 22, 2014",0.1565

9,AC6LV5D2RKTIR,B000068UWB,Michigoon tech geek,"[0, 0]","As some have said this paper is a touch on the cheap side, it's the sort of stuff you'd probably just use for taking class notes which would be transcribed later if you intended to keep them. As a cheap filler paper for kids it's not a bad idea, but anyone who's going to do a lot of erasing could use a step up.",4,"Decent, cheap",1403049600,"06 18, 2014",0.1162

However, I find the paper to be thinner than expected which may be an issue for those who exert significant pressure when they write or those who rely on their trusty eraser to get them through the day. It's OK - nothing great - a good utilitarian option.Pricing Note (not part of the review):The price as I write this review is $1.46 for 200 sheets of college-ruled filler paper. That is the delivered price if you are an Amazon Prime member or combine with other products to get Super Saver Shipping. Yes, Prime Members can literally buy this and have it delivered anywhere in the US - in 2 days - for $1.46!
