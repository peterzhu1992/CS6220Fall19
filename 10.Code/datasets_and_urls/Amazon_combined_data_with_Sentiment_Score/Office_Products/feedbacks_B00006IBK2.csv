Keeps potato chip, cereal, and other bags tightly rolled up2. Have thumb tacks or screws to hang these on for papers, photos, even magazines3. Clothes line hangers! Work much better than the wooden sets and no spring to fail4. Hold cables together for organization. Need to unplug something? Just open it up and close back on the remaining cables!5. When working on my car I use these to hold wires and other small things out of the way6. On an aquarium use these not just to organize your cable but to move airline tube out of sight. Use a thumbtack to keep it where you want it7. Hang the floor mats from your car to hose them off. I have screws setup just for this purpose. Leave them hanging to dry8.
