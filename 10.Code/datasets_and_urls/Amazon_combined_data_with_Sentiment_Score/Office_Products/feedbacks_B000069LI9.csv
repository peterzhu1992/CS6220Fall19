2,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B000069LI9,B. Colonna,"[9, 10]","What's to say - this is an OEM HP ink cartridge from HP. It performs exactly as you'd expect. The price from amazon is good. The only way you'll typically beat their price on this is either buying in bulk at a warehouse club or to buy a remanufacturered cartridge or ink kit. The former is risky as printer prices drop so fast you can end up with more ink than you need at a price higher than a new printer, and the latter which can be messy and sometimes impact print quality if you get low end stuff.",3,"Good product, nice price",1156377600,"08 24, 2006",-0.0401

I tried the re-fill route, and was not at all pleased - one cartridge leaked, another worked fine for a short while then started to produce smeary text. Bit the bullet and went back to the real HP 56 cartridge (this is for an HP all-in-one) and have never had a problem since. Cost a bit more, but they work perfectly.Amazon has a great deal if you set it up as a regular order - lower price and free shipping.

13,A6FIAB28IS79,B000069LI9,Samuel Chell,"[5, 5]","Presently the Amazon price for a new one, especially for customers who have Prime, is unmatched. You might save a few bucks with refurbs, but I sure haven't had much luck with them. Should you go with a refurb, be sure that you use your printer on a regular basis. They dry up faster than new ones, requiring multiple recleanings (and wasting of the good cartridge's ink) and occasionally simply refusing to come back to life. If you do purchase a refurb from an Amazon vendor and are dissatisfied with its performance, don't write reviews panning the cartridge as though it were Amazon's or Hewlitt Packard's fault.",5,Stick with Amazon,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",-0.0456
