They appear to be OEM canon cartridges but they are not in a blister pack as illustrated on amazon, just 2 cartridges in a little plain brown box with an Ink Express label. Each cartridge has its plastic wrapper intact. I installed the first one in my printer. Hopefully it will be fine.I only use genuine canon cartridges so I would feel better if they came in the canon blister pack as shown on amazon but I decided not to return them. I see that today they are being offered by another seller and Ink Express does not have any more for sale. It makes me wonder where these come from or how long they have been sitting around.I had picked up another canon cartridge from a well-known online auction site and it had very old canon labeling. I contacted canon and they said the cartridges do not become outdated and it was safe to use. However it lasted a lot shorter than my ink tanks usually do. Just a few words to the wise.",5,Hopefully OK But Not as Pictured,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",0.2044

Ie., if you don't want to spend money for ink...don't buy printers. We all know how much inks costs...or relatively so.I love buying the canon 4 packs when I start running out of ink.I bought the pack when my magenta indicator was active and just waited. Then it seemed like cyan followed a short while later, and then yellow and black are still waiting to join the group ;).Canon products are the best, from camcorders, cameras, scanners, printers and ink.

If it hadn't been dropped, it would still be going strong today! The most durable and reliable printer I have ever owned. Tried third party cartridges, but they were terrible.

Orchard I love lamp,"[3, 3]","I have been using Canon inks and printers for years and awhile back, I decided to try out some of those generic ink tanks and ink kits (you know, the ones with the syringes?). Both ruined my printer, after awhile. They seem to work initially, but you can tell the colors are off. Sure, the generic inks are so much cheaper, but the costs of getting a new printer are going to make up for those few $ you saved on ink.

8,A36A1ZYZH8568P,B00004U8RE,Ethan Winning Ethan Winning,"[5, 8]","We all know by now that printer manufacturers made 90% of their money on ink. In fact, I think I just saw a WSJ review that said that 60% of all HP profits came from ink. I believe it - even if I misquoted it. Whether Canon or HP, this stuff is expensive, especially if you print photographs, and especially if they're 8x10s. (Add another 50 a sheet for the Canon glossy paper!) As careful as I am in selecting such photos, I replace the black cartridge about once a month; the cyan, yellow, etc. about every 3 months.Quality is great, as good as HP. (Others have been inconsistent.) But the price is ridiculous especially since I return the empty cartridges, so I've spent $25 on maybe 4 ounces of ink. I'm seriously thinking of trying the refill services. New printers are cheap...",3,Ink is Ink or Is It?,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",0.0492
9,AU3GYRAKBUAEU,B00004U8RE,Jon Norris,"[4, 5]","I have had a Canon S630 for over a year now, and I love it. After having problems with Epson and HP printers, I tried the Canon and was astonished with the print quality. The only down side is I got my S630 before they came out with the larger format version, which I would have wanted. Certainly not Canon's fault there. I have printed 8x10s from a 2 megapixel Olympus digital camera, and was pleased with how close it came to 35mm for the price. Since 35mm has considerably more resolution than 2 megapixels, obviously there is a clear difference. However, this printer did a fine job of substituting for the One Hour Photo average picture taking level, and has saved me a ton of money.I also do not recommend generic or refill inks for printers, as I had an HP printer ruined by them. I prefer the separate tanks for each color as well, for the simple fact that they don't make you waste ink. I have gotten over 40 8x10s out of one set of ink tanks, but it varies widely with color saturation and picture content, so I don't think it is possible to give any accurate figures for usage. Another plus for Canon is that the print head is not a part of the ink cartridge, so you don't have to pay to replace that every time you replace ink tanks, unlike some other brands of printers. While there may be some value to that kind of system, Canon's system is less expensive to the user.The ink doesn't seem to dry out very fast with long periods of inactivity, although it is better for the printer to use it regularly. I also like the fact that the low ink warnings give enough time so that one can plan one's usage carefully to maximize what you have left and not run out of a color in the middle of a critical print.",5,great ink for a great printer,1075507200,"01 31, 2004",0.2265

I've tried both -- the knock off brands tend to run a little more, and they also smudge when they get at all damp.
