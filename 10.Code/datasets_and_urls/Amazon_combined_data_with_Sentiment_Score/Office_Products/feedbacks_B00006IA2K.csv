1,A2569HQNP3JZUZ,B00006IA2K,Amazon Frequent Flyer,"[10, 11]","This design is closed at the short end which makes a much better seal since laminaters recommend that you put the short end through first. Watch for this. There are some where the sealed side is on the long edge and they may bubble.This is also the perfect thickness to use with Teslin. The result is as thick and strong as a credit card, and you can trim right to the edge of the perforated Teslin and it will stay perfectly sealed.Good product.",5,"Perfect size, easy to use",1362441600,"03 5, 2013",0.5274
2,AQJUBIWM5GPEZ,B00006IA2K,Bruce A. Bennett,"[0, 0]","The Swingline Inspire laminator is wonderful. The price was great and the usefulness is a ten of ten. My wife is a school teacher and my daughter, although she, too taught in public schools, now stays home and home schools our grand daughters. Both of them needed a laminator for preparing teaching aids and other stuff. These pouches are very convenient and work quite well and I will order more when they run out of them. My youngest grand daughter has become a super-laminator so I am sure they will need more. They are simple to use and do a great job of protecting whatever was laminated. I recommend then and the laminator and these pouches to every household even if they have no children. They are compact, efficient and just great to have around.",5,These are great.,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",0.5018
3,ABY77ZEHN9WLU,B00006IA2K,Ellen Etc. Garret Books,"[0, 0]","A home laminator is a great value for the money, though I do I find that the commercial laminators at copy shops do a better job.In comparing these pouches to theSwingline Thermal Laminating Pouch, Letter Size, Standard Thickness, 100/Pack (3202018), I found them so similar in practical application that I would advise making a choice solely on price (e.g., which pouches are on sale at the moment).Not being quite clear how lamination works, I also did some destructive testing. Say your little cousin Benny decides to prank you by laminating the loot from the bank heist -- can you get it back out? To find out, I laminated some bookmarks and then tried to cut them out of the lamination plastic. Would the plastic adhere to the bookmark paper, or only to itself at the laminated edges?I discovered that the lamination plastic does adhere to the paper as well, which means you can trim up to or even inside the edge of your laminated paper if you don't want a blank plastic margin -- but you aren't getting those bills back to their plain-paper state!",4,destructive testing results,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",0.1798

7,A1EH2S92FHWZRP,B00006IA2K,Just a guy,"[2, 3]",These are 3mm pouches and are a good value for 25 at this size. I used them to make custom placemats for my 4yo daughter to give as birthday and other small gifts to family members. She draws a picture and we laminate it. Pretty easy. Keep in mind that these are 3mm - which is clearly indicated in the listing - but that 3mm is very thin. I wish I had purchased a thicker one for our purpose. Also be sure that your laminator can take an 11.5 wide pouch.,5,"nice large lamination pouches, but keep in mind that 3mm is very thin",1334620800,"04 17, 2012",0.33
8,A396ELNTQDFYPO,B00006IA2K,Mark King,"[0, 0]","Ok my title says it all, these pouches were reasonably priced, they work exactly as expected, deliver was perfect and they are BIG, I love the legal size, they must go through my laminator lengthwise but it just takes a second or two longer. These work great, you can fill them with smaller items, we make six or eight ID badges at a time by inserting loose cards as they feed into the laminator. Very happy and would buy again.",5,"Great heat seal pouches, large size, works great, excellent price",1358726400,"01 21, 2013",0.5778

Job done, with a nice clear finish. I use this form printing photos on regular paper and then protecting them - it's a cheap way to make 8&#34; x 11&#34; prints.Helpful hint: remove promptly form laminator and put under a heavy book for a few seconds while still warm so that the sheet doesn't curl up.",5,Simple to use letter size laminator pouches,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",0.4421

Once it goes through the machine, it becomes clear. The ends tend to curl a little but my projects have turned out nicely. An inexpensive way to archive or preserve my paper documents. I am very pleased with this.",4,Works fine for my projects,1369008000,"05 20, 2013",0.2445
