0,A3T7BTQBVRJDOH,B00006881R,Carrie Waterston Carrie Waterston,"[8, 9]","Works like a champ!! I'm having a lot of trouble with nonprofit groups calling to fundraise. Repeated calls to their membership offices yielded no relief and I hate to simply not give money to worthy causes in order to stop their dial-a-beggars. (I still will give money, but I had one group calling me eight times a day! Enough!!) What's worse is that a lot of these groups also raise money by selling the names and addresses of their donors to similar groups, so you really wind up getting a lot of calls.I got my TeleZapper for around $10, installed it four days ago, and believe me, it is already paying off. A dozen calls a day from the dreaded toll free number or out of area callers have now dwindled to nearly zero. I use caller ID with mine as well, so hopefully I'd be able to simply return a call from an organization I actually would want to speak to.I'm leaving off one star because my Zapper is LOUD - when you pick up the phone it emits those three tones that are at the beginning of most phone company we're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected recordings, and if you're not careful to wait a second or two before putting it to your ear it'll blow your mind. There may be some way to turn it down, though. It'd be swell if you could simply press a switch to make it do its thing instead of having to listen to the tones on every call, but it's a small price to pay for freedom from incessant 800-number calls.I'll tell you this - I'll not be without one of these gizmos again. I couldn't find any other workable options - my phone company won't allow customers to block calls on an individual basis. Now I can read a book or watch a program without being interrupted by fundraisers. Thanks Telezapper! Let me know when you guys develop a program that'll get me off the mailing lists of all the solicitors, too...:)",4,I LOVE this thing!!,1172448000,"02 26, 2007",0.0541

I had been receiving an average of three calls each evening, which I tried to deal with by turning down the answering machine. But I still heard the 'beep' each time a call was received. Worse yet, some of the callers felt the need to leave a message.The TeleZapper cuts off these calls before they even get to your answering machine, or to you. There are competing products that cost less, but this one is the most effective that I've found.",5,Its value depends upon how much you dislike telemarketers,1049587200,"04 6, 2003",0.119

I put a TelezZapper on my Christmas &quot;wish list&quot; and received one as a gift. I was a little skeptical about the thing and wasn't really sure if it would work but a few days after getting the unit the TeleZapper was on my phone line and I was waiting for the first telemarketer call to arrive to get zapped. I was also waiting to see if it would zap my DSL connection since it's on the same phone line.I didn't have to wait very long. The phone rang, I picked up the receiver, and in about a second I heard the tri-tone signal, and then said hello ... the line was silent. I called out again and got no response. I just zapped my first telemarketer and it was great!I booted up my computer to test my DSL line and it didn't skip a beat. I also checked my caller ID and it still registered numbers.Finally, something that actually seems to work!A few things to note: Re-record your message machine to allow a 2-3 second gap at the beginning so that the Telezapper can beep and not garble the beginning of your message. Tell your friends about the device on your phone and tell them not to hang up when they hear the tones. Some of my friends just thought they got a wrong number and hung up to try again. If you're not expecting any calls you may want the call to go to your answering machine first to get zapped and then pick up after you're sure there's a voice at the other end of the line. If you pick up the receiver before your answering machine picks up, wait for the tones to go off before putting the receiver to your ear -- the tones are loud.Overall this is a great little unit and it really does work with my marketing calls dropping by at least 90%.The next thing I need to do is to place the TeleZapper on my 2nd line -- my fax line -- to get rid of all those junk faxes!",5,Works Like A Charm!,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",0.1468

At 3+ cents each for paper and toner, we are saving over $30 PER YEAR (and the environmental savings of ~1000 PAGES PER YEAR!)It doesn't affect the normal operation of the fax in any way. The only con is that 1-2 per week still get through and you have to listen to those beeping tones every time there is an incoming or outgoing fax.Fair trade off.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,Saves us $32 a year in JUNK FAXES (and two reams of paper),1259712000,"12 2, 2009",0.0434
4,A2SXHP3384ER6W,B00006881R,SailorJoe,"[3, 3]","Doing a simple internet search will take you down the path to finding this product currently for $29.97. Do not pay this seller twice it's value, especially since most of us don't have land lines anymore. Anyone selling it for so much is trying to unload their inventory and get their money back. Buyer beware and do your research. That being said, any device that sends out the disconnected line tones will be effective against robocalls. Other cheaper options are to download the sound of a fax machine onto your laptop and play that when you see a robocall come in. Of course you'd only be successful at that method if you kept getting repeat robocalls from the same unknown area code.If you really want to have fun with these poor souls just trying to eek out a living like anyone else just tie them up on the phone for a long time. They get paid by the number of calls they handle and the number of scams they pull off. So tie up their time and you can have a small passive-aggressive victory dance around the dinner table. Don't yell or get angry at them. They're already locked and loaded for those calls. Plus it will just get your adrenaline going and make you angry. Nothing good will come of that other than you being angry. They're just going to call someone else and so on and so on. Just pretend like you care about what they're saying and drag on their conversation for a long while.Other options for meddling with them are blasting a loud whistle or horn in the phone (but some digital phones will cut out the loud noise. So that doesn't always work. I've also had success pretending to be a business when I see the caller ID and recognize the robocall area code (NYC in this case). Once they realize it's a business they called the operator will usually take you off the list because a business isn't engageable in a personal currency scam. In the end they'll always be harrassing you as long as you have a phone (like junk mail in your mailbox). Even if your number is unlisted these machines will randomly dial numbers at digital speeds. So don't think the machines can't get through.",1,Don't Buy this for $60!!,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",0.0087
5,A3OGPCWAPUJQY,B00006881R,Tad A.,"[46, 47]","I bought my parents a telezapper back in 2000 when they first came out. It's still going strong and the longer you have it the more effective it is as you are gradually purged from more and more databases. I recently bought two more of these, the new model TZ900's that are now sold. I have one at my residence and at my office. The one for my house arrived and did not work. The one at my office arrived and worked for 2 months then died. There is no manual on the telezapper website nor are there any instructions included when I bough these through amazon. After much searching I found that there is a CR2032 Lithium battery inside of the new models!!!!! Changed the battery out and they are back in business. I think that alot of these are old stock so they show up with dead or near dead batteries in them. If telezapper would put some documentation up that would help immensely. I will be adding a second unit at my office for my fax line to help weed out junk faxes soon.Anyhow, if your TZ has quit working try changing the batter. There are 2 screws on the bottom to remove. Then pull the top and bottom pieces apart and that will expose the CR2032 battery on the top of the circuit board. Slide it out and slide the new one in then button it back up.",4,"Better than nothing, by a longshot",1223510400,"10 9, 2008",0.0018
6,A20CQ20J30DJZT,B00006881R,Warren Holzem,"[197, 214]","I actually have the earlier model of the TeleZapper -- the one that's the size of a small answering machine. The product does exactly what it is designed to actually do, and it does so reliably. But the real question is does what the product actually do stand up to it's marketing as a way to stop telemarketers from calling you.The answer is, to some degree, sort-of.The way it works is this: The telemarketer calls you. You (or your answering machine) answers the call, and the TeleZapper beeps. If the telemarketer is using the right equipment to recognize that tone as being a non-working number, the telemarketer will automatically disconnect from the call, and theoretically delete your phone number from the list it is using.So let's look at this closer. Your phone still rings. If you (or your answering machine) does not answer the ringing phone, the beep-tone is never heard by the telemarketer's equipment. The result of not answering the phone is the same with or without the TeleZapper.Okay, so we have to answer the phone once. But after that one time aren't we deleted from the lists they all use? Well, no. There are lots of lists out there. Some are used only once. Doesn't do much good to be removed from a list that will never be used again. But in all fairness, you will be removed from a few lists that might have gotten used again.My personal experience was that initially there was no change in the number of calls. It took some time before any of those beeps my TeleZapper made had any effect on whether or not I was going to get called again. During this first period, I still got to talk to a lot of telemarketers because they weren't using equipment that the TeleZapper had any effect upon.After about three or four months, I realized that there were far fewer times that I answered the phone, and no one was there. That could mean one of two things: Either the TeleZapper was working, and I was really was being taken off the lists, or telemarketers stopped using the kind of equipment that's stopped by the TeleZapper.It's been over a year now, and it's just been in the last two weeks that things changed again. I'm now suddenly again getting lots of calls with no one there. My speculation is that the TeleZapper worked, and I was taken off of quite a few lists, but now there are new lists out there that include my name.You can't really control who calls you on the phone any more than you can control which people you pass on the street will say something to you. But just as there are things that you can do to discourage people you pass from saying something to you, there are things you can do to discourage telemarketers from calling you. The TeleZapper can be a part of your arsenal, but don't expect it to be the best tool you can use. And since the TeleZapper doesn't start to do anything unless you (or your answering machine) picks up the phone, don't expect this tool to take the lead, either.So the TeleZapper functions. It does have some effect. Is it worth the price? Well, I don't have any regrets about spending the money, but I wouldn't do it again. If your state has a no-call list, the fee to be included on that list is probably going to get you a better bang for your buck.On the other hand, if you're not as assertive as I can be with Telemarketers, the TeleZapper saves you from having to speak directly to sone telemarketers, so the price may be worth it to you.",3,"Not the End-all, Be-all Solution",1046304000,"02 27, 2003",-0.0162
