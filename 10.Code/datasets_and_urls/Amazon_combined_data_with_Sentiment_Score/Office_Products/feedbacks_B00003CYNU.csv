The only thing is when I play online games, I have to turn the mouse rest with the wrist rest to the left in order to play appropriately - but I am very happy with the purchase. Oh, and if you always have had issues with the mouse falling or slipping off of the mouse rest - it will not occur ever again with this purchase!!!!Thank you Amazon!",5,Fellowes Mouse Rest,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",0.2679

Also the gel wrest is highly recommended to help curb carpal tunnel syndrome, as it lifts the wrist during repetitive motion. It might seem a little hard on the wrist at first, but that becomes moot soon enough.",5,Great Product,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",0.4289
