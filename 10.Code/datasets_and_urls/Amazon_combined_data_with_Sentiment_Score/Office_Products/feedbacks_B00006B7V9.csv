1,AA8JEQP5MBJJQ,B00006B7V9,E. Lauber Serious about the book,"[1, 1]","I have used lots of keyboard cleaning products. I ordered this one when I saw it looking for something else. It works better than all the others, mainly due to its unique shape.",5,Best keyboard cleaner,1373932800,"07 16, 2013",0.1468
2,A1QX2UX6ZESI97,B00006B7V9,FlatPicker,"[1, 1]","To me, this kit seems like a cheap product, overall. And an unnecessary one.You get a couple of very small microfiber cloths and a cheap tool made of foam rubber that has a material something like Velcro on one side (that you scrub with) and a U-shaped prong on each end. Apparently the prongs are for going between the keys on the keyboard. You also get a small bottle of cleaning fluid.I can't see where anyone really needs any of this. You're better off using a damp cloth or something else. 3M (if it's the same company) makes some other very good products. I've used their wet or dry sandpaper over a period of years and it's excellent. But I wouldn't recommend this particular product at all.",2,You don't need it.,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",0.229
3,A3GS7OZXUEW48R,B00006B7V9,Gene Cloner,"[0, 0]","This product is simply amazing and so easy to work. I had neglected my mac keyboard at work for a while and it had accumulated quite a bit of gunk on the keys. It took just about a minute or so of cleaning with this kit. Drop the cleaning solution on to the provided sponge brush, do some circular motions on the keyboard - you'll see it getting cleaned right away. I didn't have to use the 'side' brushes, but can see how useful it would be on a windows keyboard with deeper keys.",5,it just works so well,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",0.1816

6,A2G2CO08SESWDW,B00006B7V9,Richard J Beier,"[0, 0]",This is the one. This is the first all-in-one keyboard cleaning kit I have ever used that really delivers. The instructions are clear and the tools are high quality. After using the cleaner for the first time I was amazed that my keyboard (a Logitech ergonomic) looked and felt brand new after I had used dirty fingers to pound out thousands of pages on it. Don't even bother with searching for another kit. There is one thing though. There should be about twice as much of the cleaning solution provided.,4,Dont bother with any other cleaning kit.,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",0.1726
7,A6FIAB28IS79,B00006B7V9,Samuel Chell,"[3, 4]","A mere .5oz of precious fluid that you will need to evaluate yourself before arriving at a determination of fair value. You can purchase even smaller bottles of fluid costing upwards of fifty dollars for one-time cleaning of a phonograph stylus. Audiophiles may swear by some of these esoteric liquids, while the rest of us achieve the same results with water and isopropyl alcohol at virtually no cost.In the case of this 3M cleaner the fluid is stronger than rubbing alcohol--it has a faint aroma of cigarette lighter fluid (butane) and is actually sticky to the fingers until completely dry. Nevertheless, it's undeniably effective. Squeeze a few drops on to the middle of the included bizarre-looking pad (a bright-red miniature werewolf shape), rub it across your keys, and you'll notice dirt disappear along with gummy residue. In fact, it freed up a stuck spacing bar on my Apple Magic keyboard.The werewolf has pointed ears intended for use when cleaning individual keys. But the instrument would be more practical if 3M had designed it with a single head with two pointed ears (i.e. cleaning tips) rather than placing a head at each end of the pad--2 identical heads with 4 identical ears. The user is instructed to place drops of the limited fluid on each of 2 ears for such detailed cleaning, but upon doing so there's no visible way of discerning which end of the pad (or which werewolf head) has been annointed with the precious potion.This is an instance where 2 heads definitely are NOT better than one.",4,A cleaning kit plus a bonus (or bogus?) werewolf,1338940800,"06 6, 2012",0.186
8,A2GPQZHM465OUK,B00006B7V9,Ted Detjen,"[0, 0]","I didn't know they made such a product. The two sided sponge double tips fit neatly around each key. The liquid does its job nicely. The soft cloth dampened with the liquid cleaner polishes the tops of the keys. I had no idea now dirty the area around my keys had become. This product is from 3M, a quality company.",5,A useful product for your keyboard,1368662400,"05 16, 2013",0.1712

10,AX3T5TI76TOJ1,B00006B7V9,TurquoiseEyes13579,"[11, 11]","I have owned my computer for four years, and though I dust all the time, I've neglected the deep cleaning of my keyboard almost completely. It wasn't the worst-looking thing ever, but being a black keyboard, it shows every speck of dust, hair, etc. I do eat breakfast at my computer every morning, so crumbs do occasionally become a part of my keyboard's life. I took the major keys off & cleaned the inside & bigger pieces completely, but I needed something to get in between all of the crevices. I tried Q-Tips & other stuff, but nothing ever really did the trick. This did everything I was looking for.This is designed really well. The scrub side, with several drops of the included cleaner on it, got my mouse & keys exfoliated. I cleaned in between all the keys with the red ends of the scrubber, which I'd also doused w/ some more included cleaning fluid. That left it looking great. I finally wiped it all down w/ the included cloths & it basically looks brand-new. In between the keys was so bad it left the red cleaning points a charcoal grey by the end! For the completely anal-retentive like me, having dust anywhere is a major annoyance. Now I know what to buy to get this maddening chore over with. Just wish I'd discovered it sooner!I'd prefer this to be sold in bulk, because while there's cleaning fluid left over, the ends of the scrubber are blackened by dirt & I really don't want to use them again. Honestly, I'd rather buy a package of four or something, have a slightly bigger container of the cleaning fluid and more cloths- less wasteful packaging that way, too. I'm dropping a star for packaging only- the product itself is fantastic.",4,"Wish I could buy more in bulk, but this is great",1299715200,"03 10, 2011",0.0074
11,ANYKKMEHB0ABA,B00006B7V9,Wimpy Charley Wimpy,"[0, 0]",I was looking for cleaner for keyboard and tried this one. It is good cleaner but not as I hope for. It only does the clean on surface (top) and not inside so I had to use something else for inside but this is good for surface only.,4,It is nice,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",0.2334
