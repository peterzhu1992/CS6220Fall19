We use a ton of paper at our tutoring center, and I prefer the wide ruled for my students, especially the ones in elementary school. The wide ruled lines give the young writers more room to express themselves in words and numbers. For math activities I'll sometimes turn the paper horizontal with the lines running up and down. This can help students visualize columns and be better able to list numbers one below the other.These sheets of paper have red margins on both sides for convenience of application. For those who look for it, the Mead filler paper has the certified sourcing imprimatur.",4,Putting Your Name on the Line,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",Spudman,0.2243
49,A2I4A4WGWII18Z,B00005C55O,"[0, 0]","I've been using Mead notebook paper since I was a kid in school. It's a really good standby.Nowadays I really like to use it as stationery. I cut off the red lines, and then cut down by about five lines from the top to get a good-sized lined piece of paper that can be jazzed up with rubber stamps. Additionally, I also use it a backing paper with nice stationery, so that I don't use more than one sheet of nice stationery for a letter--I use the nice piece as the first page, and these cut to size for other sheets. Either way, it helps save money while creating lined stationery. (Yes, I'm someone who still writes letters!)Whichever use you're getting it for--stationery or school--this basic pack is a generous size with 200 sheets.",5,Nice standby,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",Sunny Sewing Honeybee,0.4123

Exactly the quality you expect from Mead--decent thickness with clear, crisp lines and edges--and ideal for grade-school to middle-school writers. If wide-ruled notebook paper is what you, or your child, needs, this is as good as, or better than, any other option. With one caveat ... It's the kind of thing best bought on sale, because off-season or single pack purchase can be absurdly pricey: 4 to 5 times the price of the same goods at better times (like back to school events).",4,"Good Quality, But Best Bought on Sale",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",S.
