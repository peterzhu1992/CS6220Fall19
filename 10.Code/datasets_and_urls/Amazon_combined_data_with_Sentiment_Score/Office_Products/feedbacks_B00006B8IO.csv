And just like it's companion (Fellowes Gel Crystals Wrist Rest, 91137), which I also purchased via Amazon, the mousepad does not slide around. I am very happy with both my mousepad and wrist rest.",5,"The color is royal blue, not light blue!",1403568000,"06 24, 2014",0.3911
2,A1V68CETC0BXV7,B00006B8IO,J. A. Eastman boomer,"[0, 0]","I got this new mouse pad/wrist rest when I got my new trackball mouse. I had read the reviews and I was impressed by the reviews that said the gel did not compress like the foam types.So far, my expectations have been met. The wrist rest is comfortable and it does not compress like my old foam one did.Being as I use a trackball, I did have one problem. My trackball mouse slid all over the pad when I pressed a button. I would expect that to be good news for people who use the traditional roll around type of mouse.My solution was to buy a set of those round non-slip jar openers for the kitchen. One of them under my mouse completely solved the slipping problem.I like this mouse pad/wrist rest so much that I bought a gel pad wrist rest for my keyboard. They are both great!",5,Great Wristrest,1187222400,"08 16, 2007",0.2873

4,A1ZFM7VYC7H,B00006B8IO,loripori,"[0, 0]",Ordered for my husband as a birthday present and couldn't have picked anything better. He will not use any other wrist rest. His old one had some SERIOUS age on it but still worked GREAT. I just thought it was time for one that looked fresher and had a fresh mousepad surface. Fellowes mousepad/wrist rests are the best!!!,5,Husband's Favorite,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",0.3769
