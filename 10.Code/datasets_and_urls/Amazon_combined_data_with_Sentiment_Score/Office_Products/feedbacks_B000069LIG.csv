If it had a digital display this would have been a 5 star phone. My mistake, I thought all phones had a digital display. Otherwise, it rings and you can talk on it : )",4,Basic Phone,1329004800,"02 12, 2012",-0.0509

2,A2J0IBS4PFRO2C,B000069LIG,Bakari Chavanu,"[1, 1]","Maybe I overlooked the information, but you can't use just any regular headset or earphones with this unit. You have to purchase the Panasonic KX-TCA400 headset. The unit does not come with the optional headset, and the two models they did this in the instruction guide are discontinued. I purchased this phone particularly for the hands-free feature; it will be useful if they pointed out that only a specified headset works with the phone.",3,Requires special headset,1359072000,"01 25, 2013",0.1069
3,A3VVKC910FN4EK,B000069LIG,David Basham,"[0, 0]",Great business phone. Has ample amplification and works great with the headset they recommend. I use it for LiveOps and it has paid for itself already.,5,Great with the headphone set,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",0.4633

I purchased to use mainly when I am not home to use with my magic jack where there is free wi-fi and also at home if I lose power.

5,A11ED8O95W2103,B000069LIG,lighten_up_already2 lighten_up_already2,"[135, 138]","I bought this as an auxillary phone. We've got an answering machine and a fax machine, but I needed an additional phone to be by the computer in my downstairs office and I wanted a speakerphone so when I was telecommuting I could call into meetings and listen to them without holding a receiver up to my ear.I was convinced to buy this phone by the string (until recently aftet I placed my order) of rave reviews for this phone, combined with the terrible reviews for so many other speakerphones that cost less.I've only had this phone for a few days, but I can say that it is attractive and seems to be built well. I called in to work and tried out the speakerphone and it seemed to work well on both ends. I heard the other party fine and the other party did said I sounded good.I like the uncluttered controls with big number buttons and big buttons for volume and speakerphone. I didn't have to pay for a lot of features that I don't need.This phone also has the added bonus of a headset input, so if I ever need to talk a whole lot from my home office, I could get a headset and talk while keeping both hands free. So far, so good.Postscript: It's September of 2007 and the speaker volume is now impossible to control and the unit seems to be buzzing. I can't use it for conference calls anymore. I guess I'll buy another one, but I'll look around first.OOPS! I forgot that this phone is powered by three AA batteries. They need to be replaced on occasion. When they start running down, the speakerphone gets squirrely. So, I replaced them and now the phone works fine.",5,Very happy so far...,1142467200,"03 16, 2006",0.2351

7,A1FFMPJ0W6FHQ8,B000069LIG,Nickolas Morgaan Walk In Peace,"[0, 0]","For a simple no bells and whistles phone, this did the trick. There is an ability to put batteries in the thing, but I don't know why. Just plugging it into the wall works well and I have had no complaints. This has been good for work at home jobs as well as when the electricity goes out. In a pinch, when the cordless is dead, we also use this phone.",5,Works well,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",0.0619
8,A23ONMGKEWDG4M,B000069LIG,R. Sutton,"[6, 10]",as advertised and does everything it says it will. Speakerphone does a nice job.UPDATE - LOWER TO 2 STARS.After a couple months operation the speakerphone portion of the unit becomes worthless.,5,Nice Unit,1193097600,"10 23, 2007",-0.2324
9,AJ5KIXPYWYAVH,B000069LIG,The Rao,"[2, 3]",I purchased this 2 months ago... It has worked well (as I had expected). One thing would be nice to have is the ability to click on Speakerphone without lifting the handset. The documentation is not clear in this regard. I have tried different options but the only way I have been able to use the speakerphone was to first lift the handset... I need to do some online research to see if I am missing something.Otherwise... the product is excellent!,4,Excellent Phone,1175990400,"04 8, 2007",0.1709
