0,A1KBLPXHWKYOZ9,B00006HN5Q,Andy H.,"[0, 0]","I found the magnetic strength of these sheets to be lacking. When cut into smaller pieces, about 1/4 of a sheet, they could hardly hold up a piece of paper on the fridge. Any smaller than that and they were lucky to stick to the fridge at all. The printing quality was decent. Had to feed them individually, which was expected. Also easy to cut with normal scissors.",3,Not very strong,1325635200,"01 4, 2012",0.1408

Cutting the sheets using a paper cutter and scissors was equally easy. Now I have custom fridge poetry.For my goals, this product was perfect.",5,Very Happy,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",0.313

I wasn't sure if these would be strong enough given the comments of how thin they are but since we plan to use our dolls on cookie sheets they will be more then perfect. Plus since they are thin instead of the usual recommended settings with the cricut you actually only need to multi cut these 2 times (I haven't tested yet but I think even once would work as long as you're using the deep cut blade set to 6 and pressure at 4 or 5).I also used them to just make cute magnets for the fridge with the cricut. Though I'm not sure they would actually hold up more then a single piece of paper they do stay up well on their own even with 2-3 layers of paper glued to them (ie I cut the base shape out of the magnetic paper, then the base shape again out of my background color, then they layers and glued them all together). Super cute!They also cut very easily with an exacto knife or scissors. For anyone curious the surface is matte not glossy, so sadly I don't think they would work at all with the alcohol inks.",5,Review for Cricut users!,1295049600,"01 15, 2011",0.2452
4,A1OSMUWASSRR36,B00006HN5Q,Nicole Machi,"[9, 10]","I bought these to print out pictures, cut them up into puzzle pieces, and place them on a magnetic rectangle so they can be rearranged into the right places. The magnet they are placed on is pretty substantial (at least the thickness of all 5 sheets of this paper), and the puzzle pieces stick fine when the whole thing is lying on a table, but when I lift it up sometimes the pieces fall off!I tried sticking a piece on my fridge and it wouldn't stay--and the packaging says it will stick AND hold up a piece of paper on most metal surfaces. I couldn't get it to stick at all! And the magnetic paper just stuck on a good magnet doesn't even stay very well when it's lifted off the table so that gravity is affecting the pieces. Overall, it works fine for my purposes because the puzzles are meant to stay on a table, but I just can't see any use for them beyond that.",3,Works ok...,1290038400,"11 18, 2010",0.1174
