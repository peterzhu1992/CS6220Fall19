2,AY91MQZZR750W,B00004Z5T0,MichiganTraveler,"[3, 3]",These worked great for us. We pasted them on light parchment envelops and they disappeared. The ink was nice and crisp coming out of the printer. They were ok to remove from the sheet and adhere. Nice product.,5,Works great as advertised.,1337126400,"05 16, 2012",0.3075

6,AFIHZGX5DMIXS,B00004Z5T0,Rich P,"[0, 0]",They work well in my Canon multifunction printer scanner. If it didn't work I wouldn't order the4 same thing again. Only complaint is that the one edge seems to pull away from the backing paper before I'm ready for it.,4,This is the second package I've purchased,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",0.1253
7,A3MQQRV9SO95Z4,B00004Z5T0,Vivian L. Wahl,"[0, 0]",These labels are ideal for my printer and easy to peel off. I would recommend them to anyone in the market for these types of labels.,5,Avery Easy Peel Mailing Labels for Ink Jet Printers,1373155200,"07 7, 2013",0.5521
