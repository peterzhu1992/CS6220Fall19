There are many factors that I look at when buying labels, especially in quantity:1. Price. Big variances between 'generic' and 3M, Avery, etc.2. Glue. Good glue won't come through the label.3. Adhesive Quality. Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter), and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4. Ease of removing from sheet. If they are not easy to remove, the label can be easily torn. Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value, and have the other characteristics of good labels.

I always intentionally put printed addresses and return addresses on anything I mail. Using labels that are printed on a computer printer keeps your mail on automation and out of the hands of humans. I've never had any mail lost because I use pre-printed labels. Avery labels are simply the best and these are the perfect size to use for a return address. Just load a full page into your printer (I have a laser printer) and print a full page at one time of perfectly printed labels to be used on your envelopes.

8,AHFGCH8LANEZK,B00004Z5QP,Dana G.,"[0, 0]","I wasted several sheets of these labels because the text does not line up with the label. Usually I print out a sample on plain paper and hold it up behind the sheet of stickers to see if the text and sticker line up properly. I did do this once, but there is so much text, and the stickers are so small, that it was a waste of time. I did have to adjust my document margin on top so everything would line up, but that was just guesswork.Then I noticed that on the label it says to use template 5167. So why are these stickers called 5267 labels? What is the point of calling it that when you ultimately use a template with a different number? That is a problem. Then I dug out my other labels of the same size, also Avery. The older package with the same feature of being easy peel is just called easy peel, whereas this one says it has a pop-up edge. We'll I don't see any difference between the two besides that there is label material in the middle of the page on the older one. These labels have a space of no label material in the center, just the backing material. With or without this sliver of material it works the same way. Both are exactly the same size, and the space at the top of the label is the same also. The older ones also say to use template 5167. Even when I used the right template the text still did not line up on the label. I also made the font smaller, as fonts can be called the same size, but actually be bigger or smaller. I don't recall ever having so much trouble with this size label sheet. I am using MS Word for Mac, but that shouldn't be an issue here.In any case, the labels themselves are fine. They stick on things fine, and easily peel off the paper. I would prefer a slightly larger label to use as return address labels.

The 5267 return address label is supported natively in Microsoft Word, even in my old Office XP version. If you prefer, you can download the Word template from Avery's website. Why? It's easier to use this template if you want to have different addresses on the same sheet. Also, maybe you don't have Microsoft Office but have a compatible word processing program like WordPerfect or OpenOffice.The pop-up edge is a neat idea to allow for easy peeling though I really never had problems peeling the old style labels. Labels aren't very exciting and there is only so much you can do to differentiate between one manufacturer's labels to another's. However, the paper, adhesive, and the easy-peel feature on the Avery 5267 are all top notch and I have no complaints. I typically buy office store-brand labels but these Avery's seem to have a better overall quality.2000 labels are a great deal but the 8000 label pack is even better, if you send out lots of mail.

This means that you bend the sheet at the side and the labels you want literally pop up an exposed edge so you can grab them easily. Then you fold the sheet flat again. As with most labels, you can get away with running the sheet through to print only a few labels and then rerunning a partial sheet for a second print of the remaining labels. In my experience, each subsequent use of a partial sheet runs a greater risk of a jam though.

They adhered themselves to my envelopes like little soldiers...just as if their tiny little label lives depended on it...which, I suppose, they did. There is room to write even the most pretentious European address, where they add all kinds of extra lines just to show off that they are in Europe, when we in America, the largest God Given Land Mass in The Continental World Of Its Kind, need just 3 lines.Does it mean we are better than those who live overseas? Maybe. And we don't have to talk with those fancy accents either, or in those foreign languages. What's with them? When did they start with that? Do they think they are too good to speak English? Which is the language used in the Bible, so are they sending a message that way, too? Like to Satan or his mignons????BAnyway that is for each of us to determine in his or her own heart,and we are not here to talk about the snide, red-tinged and possibly devil worshiping Europeans, but about these Avery Labels, so let us return to our subject. But you must admit, speaking a foreign language AND using more than 3 lines in an adress is just putting it on that one layer too thick. .Okay, here we are, back to the labels again. What makes Avery 1/2 X 1 3/4 Laser Printer Labels one notch better than your label (and certainly your inferior European label), what takes them to that semi-mythical Uber-label pantheon, is the stick up edge. You know when you have ten million labels to stick on envelopes and you try bending the page so the labels are easier to pull off,but some bend and some don't, and a couple even bend too far so they get stuck to themselves and you have to sneaky throw them away so no one will see? Well finally somebody twigged to the need for a bent edge label and here it is.The bent edge does not make sticking labels on envelopes any less miserable, time-consuming and tedious a job, one more suited to, say, the Europeans. Labelling is awful work, particularly when one does it in one's office where one cannot turn the TV set on to watch Judge Judy, but the Avery Labels have that bent edge, a new High Tech Cutting Edge Design Element that makes the job go a little bit faster and every little bit helps.

I have a few gripes, so I guess I'll stand as the devil's advocate review today, which is rare for me.The labels themselves were of great quality, never jammed or peeled in the printer, and the way you get the labels off of the paper by folding it is ingenious and better than I've seen elsewhere. That being said, all I wanted was a simple way to put my return address on the labels. The issues that I had mostly revolve around the software.1. The web based printing is simple & easy... it creates PDF's that you download and print. I had issues getting things to line up though, so I wasted about 50% of the labels on each sheet. I wasn't being that picky-- as long as everything was on the label, and nothing was on a label from an adjacent label, I considered the label a win-- even if not centered. Still, I lost about 50% of them.2. I downloaded the full version of Avery software from the company-- for free! I was happy with that, and expected it to be basic. But at least at the time of this review, product 5267 was not listed in the software so I couldn't use the software.3. Take me to the third & final option-- support for Microsoft Word. I have word 2010 and figured that would be the best bet. After downloading the Avery software for Office 2010, it wouldn't install... I use Windows 7 64 bit and Office 64 bit, so the software wasn't compatable.So all of that being said, I'm glad so many others have had such great success with the labels. I had hoped that the Avery Stand Alone software was going to be the key to success for me as it also supposed print alignment testing, however, the lack of support for this particular label was the final thing to run me off track.I hope some of these gotchas are helpful to some of you using Windows 7 64 bit or really care about print alignment.I gave it 3 stars because really, even with the label waste on option 1, the ones I did get that were ok enough were good enough to fill my need of return labels. If I really needed tons of labels and spent more time tweaking and wasting more sheets, there is a good chance I could achieve less waste. And I may try that again.Update! Success! Sort of.... Word 2010 has some built in default label printing functionality and this label is one of the options. I don't have the nice photo options and it still took some wasting of a few sheets, but I was able to get a full sheet of return address labels with no wasted ones!",3,Being the devil's advocate,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",0.3182

These Avery labels were easy to use in my home printer using the template they recommended. Super duper easy to peel off and use. I don't think I'll have to buy return address labels for a looooong time since the pack comes with 2,000 of them!",5,Easy to use,1301961600,"04 5, 2011",0.3376

However, for my application, I need to fed one sheet multiple times, as I use labels on items that I craft. Unfortunately, with these Avery labels, after I feed them a couple times, the adhesive seems to bleed through and the label turns a bit brown. I am using a HP laserjet, but I have had this problem before with the lower end labels. The more expensive labels don't have that problem.So, if you plan to print one sheet at a time, this should be fine. If you plan to print only a few labels at a time, look for another product.",3,OK but not perfect,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",-0.0843

You could also use them for the main address label if your recipient's address is short enough.Recommended.",4,Quality labels,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",0.1845

The die-cut labels fed well through my HP laser printer, stuck well on envelopes and packages, and didn't smear. These labels may also be written on by hand when called for which is a useful benefit. The Pop-up Edge is a feature which allows you to fold the sheet so one edge lifts, making it easy to peel the label from the sheet. The center margin has also been removed to facilitate easier removal compared to earlier products. I found this Pop-up to be a double edged sword so to speak as once the labels are popped-up, I found that they don't quite go back to flat. The feature is good if you are printing a whole sheet but I sometimes print individual labels which means the popped label is a potential jam in the printer.I found that the Avery labels get the job done which earns them 4 stars. Compared to the 3M labels however, the Avery labels are more expensive and I do not think the Pop-up Edge is as effective as 3M's Quick Lift Design.",4,Quality Product That Will Get the Job Done,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",0.4217
