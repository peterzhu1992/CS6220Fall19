This review was before I had used Kodak's One Touch to better Pictures. Please see my Kodak Paper review prior to making your buying decision. I was really impressed with what Kodak did.REVIEW IS BASED ON USE ON THE EPSON 890:When I bought my Epson 890, I bought several different packs of Epson paper, this 8 X 10 one, an 8.5 X 11 one and some 4 X 6 sheets as well as the roll paper. See my separate reviews on the others items (including the printer) also on this site, if you are interested in them. However, finally, I got around to trying the 8 x 10 paper. You see you wait until you have the perfect picture to do an enlargement.NICE QUALITY IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT USESIt did not dissappoint. Wow, the colors were great. I took several types of pictures and different lighting and the result were great. Now that I've tried it I'm hooked. People who have seen the pictures first of all can't believe they are off an inkjet printer. Then they marvel at the color and sharpness of the photo.PAPER AND PRINTER INTERATION:One caution, those of you that think you can use any paper on any printer... Forget it. I had some paper from another supplier and when I used it on the Epson, the ghostly images were terrible. It seems not surprisingly that the printers are optimized for their papers. And to be honest, it is not worth the money to me to try a bunch of other manufacturer's paper only to find out the results would be bad.EASIER TO FIND ON THE WEB THAN IN THE STORES:This paper is easier to find on the net. I have looked in my usual spots for this paper off the web and considering not only computer, office supply and grocery stores it is just not out there.Great product... Enjoy.",5,"Wow, great results",1007078400,"11 30, 2001",0.2325

7,ATFBVUXDIRXT6,B00004Z6NA,D. Matheny,"[0, 0]","We've been using HP inkjet printers for years and we have a pretty good stash of 4x6 photo paper that we had planned to use with our new Epson Artisan 710 printer. Unfortunately, when we printed our first 4x6 photo we knew immediately that something was wrong since the colors were extremely blotchy and it took the ink several minutes to dry.I tried changing every printer and quality setting I could find, then it occurred to me that the problem might be the HP paper. I was skeptical, but I figured I would buy a pack of this paper just to test the theory since it is fairly inexpensive.Anyway, I know it sounds crazy, but this paper completely solved the problem and we're getting beautiful prints from our new Epson Artisan 710 printer! If you're planning on using HP photo paper with an Epson printer; take my advice and give it away instead - then buy some of this Epson paper for awesome results!As far as the quality of the paper goes, it feels just like the paper used by professional labs. It also has the right level of gloss to print photos that are sharp and colorful.I highly recommend this paper for use with Epson printers.",5,Beautiful photos compared to HP paper on Artisan 710 printer!,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",0.2775
8,A36K2N527TXXJN,B00004Z6NA,Dr. Bojan Tunguz,"[1, 1]","Recently I got a newEpson XP-410 Printerand was extremely dissatisfied with the quality of the photo prints. After complaining about it to a friend, he told me to try using Epson's own photo paper (I had used HP paper before). Sure enough, the quality of prints improved dramatically. Since my Epson printer is WiFi AND AirPort compatible, I'd much rather use it than my old HP printer. Which means that from now on I'll be shopping for Epson photo paper as well, and my stockpile of old HP paper has become useless. I may still hang on to it just in case I switch back to an HP printer at some point in the future.The paper itself is very nice. The prints are smooth and glossy, as advertised. They are on par with the prints you'll get from the numerous online photo printing sites, but the exact outcome may depend on the quality of the printer you have, as well as on the ink. I am also not sure how durable these prints are, but since I still have many digital photos gracing the walls of my house that are over a decade old, I am pretty confident that this paper will endure for a foreseeable future.",5,THE ONLY photo paper that should be used with Epson printers,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",0.2391

In simple words, this is very high quality paper that I would recommend for your 4x6 printing at home.

I've probably used close to a thousand sheets, and the paper quality has been consistently excellent. I'm currently using the paper with an Epson XP-850 printer.

It took us a while to dial in on the right paper for the Airprint from our iOS devices. This Premium paper did the trick. Ultra Premium was too shiny and did not look right.

16,A2RLLC0EGSXPPR,B00004Z6NA,Joel Schopp,"[8, 8]","A word on photo quality. Using a Epson Artisan printer with the correct paper will produce better photos than you will get at a typical photo lab. I highly recommend the Epson Photo papers as they are designed for the Epson inks and the Epson printers specifically. I tested the Epson Premium Photo Paper Glossy and Epson Ultra Premium Photo Paper Glossy and recommend both. Looking at the same image side by side on the two papers the differences are almost imperceptible. The detail and color are identical under the most careful scrutiny. A few differences emerge under very careful observation:* The Ultra Premium Paper is slightly heavier paper, this adds to its stiffness. When picking up a 4x6 photo from the 4 edge there is about half as much bend vs the Premium Paper.* The Ultra Premium Paper has an ISO brightness of 96, versus 92 for the Premium Paper. This makes no difference in color rich areas of photos but in light highlights if you stare long enough you can convince yourself they are brighter in the Ultra Premium. Telling the difference in brightness requires good light, identical photos side by side, and far too much scrutiny.* The Premium costs about 12.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100* The Ultra Premium costs about 22.7 cents per 4x6 sheet in packs of 100Given the quality differences are almost imperceptible and the price difference is almost double I'd recommend the Premium for every day use and the Ultra Premium only if you are entering a photo contest or have money burning a hole in your pocket.
