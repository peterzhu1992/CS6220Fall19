The easy peel aspect is very nice and does help with efficiency in applying sticker.The only problem these stickers have for us is that they are not permanent application stickers. The adhesive on these creates a reasonably strong bond, but will pull off. It appears they are designed to do this. I know that some people want to be able to remove their stickers later and for those type of people these stickers would be perfect.

Templates for their labels easily available on their website, although I was a little annoyed that they required a name and e-mail address in order to download the template, even though they promised not to share the information. The acid test for any labels is whether or not they are going to peel off inside your printer, jamming and/or causing damage. Avery obviously knows adhesives well because these are firmly enough affixed to the backing sheet so that they don't jam or peel off and yet are easy to peel off when you are ready to use them. These are a bit too large for return address labels, but would work for that. Best suited for the address of the person you are sending to. They are big enough for most addresses, although seem to be a little small for longer addresses. You can do 5 lines with a 10-point font and probably around 30 characters per line (depending on whether you use all caps or lower case too). This would accommodate all but the longest addresses. It's a little smaller than what I like, but still quite readable. I wouldn't want to go any smaller. If addresses are shorter, you can use a bigger font. I would have liked these a little wider than the 2 5/8 inches, but if they were any wider, a third less labels would be on each page.

24,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00006B8FZ,"[12, 13]","I've been using Avery 5160 return address labels for years, so I was interested in how the Easy Peel differed from the older ones I still had. When I took the first sheet out of the box, I was immediately concerned about the weight of the backing; the sheets seemed much flimsier than those I had remaining in my old box, a choice obviously made in the interest of the pop-up edges. Once I printed a sheet of both and compared the labels themselves, they seemed comparable. However, a couple of issues emerged: it was slightly more difficult to manually insert a sheet of the Easy Peel so that the labels lined up correctly because the sheets were more likely to bow, and printed labels stored in a file folder were more likely to catch and come off when pulled in and out. Despite this, these labels maintain the Avery quality the company has been known for, and they stick well and completely to envelopes. Note: these labels are for laser printers, not for inkjets.The Easy Peel feature is only marginally better than the old style, which I never found difficult to remove. Here, you fold the sheet along each row, and a small portion of the labels' ends pop up. It definitely can save time if you're doing a lot of mailing/labeling; however, most people won't care. I appreciated the feed arrows since I always forget which end should be up when feeding manually. I printed ten sheets out of the box, in rapid succession, and other than the lining up issue noted above, every sheet came out smoothly and perfectly printed.Although Microsoft Word has the necessary template for these labels in its project gallery, buyers can also get the correct template at the Avery website (address supplied on the box).I've used several different brands of mailing labels, and I always come back to Avery. Despite the lighter backing of these labels to enable the Easy Peel, the labels themselves maintain the same high quality. I just wish the ease of removal could be combined with a slightly heavier/stiffer backing.

I don't use them as mailing labels.When this big box of 3,000 labels arrived, I immediately pulled off a few of the labels and stuck them to the top and smooth side (vertically) of a half-pint canning jar and onto a ziplock bag and put them in the freezer. A day later, the labels were still adhering well, and yet they were not a complete pain to get off. (Try pulling the label off dry, and if it doesn't come right off, it will come off after a soak in dishwater.) So now I can print out sheets of labels like 08/2010 Tomato Sauce or 2010 Okra Seeds and have them handy for when I'm canning, freezing, and dehydrating all my garden produce and saving seeds for next season. I put up a LOT of food. Also, I can quickly write and stick eat-by dates on anything in the fridge.Labels for canning jars cost a lot of money.

I basically run them through my laser printer to print a basic template that includes: date, bullet, bullet weight, over-all length, powder, and powder charge.

After I empty each box, I just peel the sticker off and the box is ready to go again.I realize that this specific use probably isn't interesting to everyone, but it seems like these labels could be applied in a similar way to lots of different organizing tasks.Since a single sheet of labels can last me several weeks, I like that these labels stay stuck to the printer backing and don't come off before I'm ready to use them. Fortunately, the labels are still easy to peel off the backing sheet because of an exposed pop-up edge for each label - it's a pretty ingenious setup.Finally, for those of you who are using these as mailing labels, I've found that the glue is nearly permanent when applied to paper envelopes - so no worries there.Overall, I'm completely satisfied with this product and I highly recommend them.",5,Great for reloading data,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",D.

Secondly, half of the time the envelope jams and you must pull the printer apart to fix the problem.

But, that ease comes with a few limitations illustrated the images that I've uploaded. These may or may not affect you.For this review, I printed an entire sheet of return address labels on each product. The Easy Peel labels are unquestionably easier to remove than the standard labels, as you simply flex the sheet and the edges of the labels in one column detach from the backing sheet as shown in the photos I've posted.If you typically print full sheets of labels, you'll be pleased with the ease of removing the labels. While the standard labels can sometimes curl, or get a damaged corner as you peel, these labels come off cleanly.But, there are two situations where the standard Avery product is still better: printing single labels and re-using the sheet, and tearing the sheet into thirds for storage or distribution of labels.Microsoft Word (and other software) has the ability to print a single label on a sheet in the row and column specified in the label dialog. This works well with the standard Avery product. With the Easy Peel product, if you've accidentally bumped adjacent labels while peeling off printed ones, the labels may jam your printer. (The jam-free guarantee refers to fresh sheets of labels.)If you typically tear your 5160 sheet at the perforations to get three columns of labels, you will not want to do that with the Easy Peel product. As shown in the photos, unlike the clean edge of the older product, the Easy Peel coumn has about 1/8 of the sticky label extending beyond the backing after tearing.",4,Easier to use than standard labels for full sheets,1280448000,"07 30, 2010",Karl,0.4392

She gets a box of locks, and a form which has her assigned lockers printed on it. She puts a lock on the locker, and then copies the combination from the tag to the form.If she reads the combination out loud, or hands the sheet to a student to copy their combination off of it, the student can overhear someone else's combination or copy it off of the sheet while copying their own. She said, I could use labels for this.So I said, Anything to help the educational system. I have these labels I have to test for Vines!So I selected the laser labels because they have a laser printer at school. Unfortunately, they had turned off the air conditioner, despite a promise to leave it on for the entire weekend before school. It was unbearably hot (the classrooms have no ventilation at all if the A/C is off - they just bake in the sun. So we came home.First we put the lockers and their combinations into a spreadsheet. Then I told Microsoft word to fill in a sheet of labels with the information from the spreadsheet. I selected Avery, then I selected 8 1/2x11 products and then 5160 and the first sheet I printed had a problem. I had put the info on the labels on the left edge of the printed area, and a full character printed in the gutter between labels. The result was completely unusable. The locker combinations had the first character cut off, and that could be a 0, 1, 2, or 3. I printed a plain sheet of paper first and laid it over the labels, but the one character off was too close to tell.I printed them again, and this time I centered the labels. They came out perfectly. The ink does not smudge.The point is that she can peel a label off, and hand it to the student. Then she writes the locker number down on her form. The student gets their locker number and combination in one action, without being allowed to either look at the form that has everyone's combination on it, or hear combinations be read aloud. I offered her a second set of labels with just locker numbers on it, for her form. She said it would be easier to just write it, given the area that had to be fit and the size of the label.I was pleased that the laser labels worked in my inkjet printer - even though the paper path is tight. I was disappointed in the fact that the labels were about a character off from the template - and in the wrong direction, resulting in characters missing the label to the left, and resulting in my wasting a sheet of labels. I tried navigating the Avery site for label templates and gave up after a couple of minutes when I realized that they were built into Microsoft Word.I was pleased in the way the ink does not smudge, despite the fact that this is not labeled for use in ink jet printers.And when she went to use the labels, my wife said that the labels were Wonderfully easy to remove, the process was fast, you never thought about the labels, they just worked.So the only star off was for the templates.

This might not make a difference if you are only printing a few labels, but it could be a nice time saver if you are doing a mass mailing.One other side note...These labels are for laser printers. Be sure to get the type of labels that are designed for your printer (inkjet labels for inkjet printers, laser labels for laser printers).
