2,A15F0X7UOLWKT4,B00006IATF,coyotesings coyotesings,"[0, 0]",I wanted a large paper trimmer for trimming paper beyond the standard 8 1/2 X 11&#34; without spending a fortune. I also wanted one that would hold up to use. This trimmer has met the first need. Only time will tell how it holds up to use but since I take care of my office equipment I expect that it will. It's not very heavy overall but the cutting blade has some heft to it. So far I've only used it to slice some heavy stock paper and that was no effort whatsoever. The cut is true when you line it up flush with the back edge of the trimmer. It is attractive as well and looks good in the office. There is a nice metal clip that will lock the blade down when not in use.,5,"Big, sharp and highly functional",1400544000,"05 20, 2014",0.1718
3,A1LW93HGONNQUU,B00006IATF,Dr. Philip J. Kinsler,"[3, 3]","This is sharp, cuts and trims very well, and seems sturdy enough for my uses, which are occasional but include matboard and adhesive backed felt. However I sometimes need to do precise trimming, as when connecting two parts of a template that contains multiple pages. Here it is necessary to join them properly to obtain a correct finished product. And this is where the lack of a precise 0 reference point is a real drawback. The rulers start with the one inch mark and there are no markings beween 0 and 1 inch. There is no easy sight reference, either--a red line, a triangle... one has to guess and then come at 0 in several increments. This is a pain and unnecessary. The end of the cutting board is not easy to see once you have paper over it. I'LL PROBABLY figure out a way to make a visible line but this shouldn't be necessary. Guess I could hcve bought one with a laser but didn't want to spend the money.",3,Cuts very well. Rulers not precise,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",-0.1634

Berman Kitty Safe Network,"[0, 0]","I was using scissors to cut tons of labels for work, and it would start to hurt my hand after a while.This paper cutter looks great, and behaves just as I need it to. I didn't need perfection, I just needed to cut down double printed labels quickly, and I like howcompact it is.It comes with a arm lock which is safe too, especially with clumsy me and pets around.Am pleased.",5,So happy I bought this,1349481600,"10 6, 2012",0.4579
6,A2CACYNRZ337HQ,B00006IATF,Jonathan White,"[0, 0]","We do a lot for our sons PTA, so we have to cut a lot of items for promotions and what not. We had a small 6' cutter, that was too small for some sizes of paper.This cutter cuts real smooth, and has a lock on the blade which is nice for the little kids to stay away from. The one part I think is iffy is that there is no 'clasp' like thing to put on your paper while cutting. So basically, if you cut a large stack the paper starts to slide from the force. The small one we used to have had a plastic piece that you could apply pressure onto to prevent the paper from moving. However, this only becomes an issue when the blade gets duller; if this one does not work out well with large stacks i will update this review.",4,Nice large cutter.,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",-0.2997
7,A1VQHH85U7PX0,B00006IATF,MyBeesWax A Music Fan,"[115, 115]","** Pros **I was able to cut through 8 sheets of paper fairly easily. Note, however, that it requires a little exertion to cut through 10 or more sheets. The cutting blade is very sharp and is self-sharpening. The manual says each cut actually sharpens the blade so the blade never gets dull. The trimmer makes nice clean cuts and is able to cleanly shave off the tiniest piece from the edge of the paper. It is built very sturdy, and the Swingline brand name promises exceptional durability and performance. The trimmer looks sharp (pun not intended) and will make a handsome addition to the stationery in your home or office.** Cons **The guard rail is about an inch from the cutting edge, so this cutter might not be suited for very small jobs. The board on the trimmer is not constructed from solid wood but from a chipboard slab. The top is laminated to make the board look like solid wood. (As an upside, however, the markings are clearly printed and the laminate is so realistic looking that initially I thought the board was made of solid wood). The underside of the trimmer is somewhat crudely constructed (Can you say fussy?).** Conclusion **Functionally, this trimmer gets a resounding 5-stars! Construction-wise, I wish the board was made of solid wood. Also, the guard rail gets in the way of very small jobs. All in all, the Swingline ClassicCut Guillotine Paper Trimmer is a really good paper trimmer, and considering the price, it is a good value for your money! If the specifications meet your needs, I would definitely recommend it.",5,"Does The Job, Chipboard Board with Laminate Top A Downside",1195171200,"11 16, 2007",0.2259

10,A3PVCMQ961V2RL,B00006IATF,Wombatmatty,"[3, 3]","It's ok if you want to trim off some excess. But you have to hold the paper very still or the blade will pull it toward the end of the cut. There is no guide, so cutting multiple pieces can be time consuming.I'm really disappointed in that if I cut a sheet in half and truly want to use both pieces, it partially bends the piece of paper to the right of the blade. I don't like that at all.",2,"Decent, but not great.",1357430400,"01 6, 2013",-0.2383
