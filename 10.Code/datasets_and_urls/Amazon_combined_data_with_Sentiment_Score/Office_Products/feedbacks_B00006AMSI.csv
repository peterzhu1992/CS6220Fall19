0,A4WEZJOIZIV4U,B00006AMSI,Chuck Bittner Disabled comedian & gamer!,"[1, 1]","As noted in one of the reviews. The software is in great, but the fact it is powered by USB is one less chord to worry about. I recommend it to anyone interested in a cheap portable scanner. You'll fall in love with it. Again, don't expect too much and we pleasantly surprised.One thing I love the auto crop feature when I scan a photo it crops it in the final image. Instead of having a big white area where there was no photograph. It is cool.Peace out",4,"I love this scanner. It's just simple, plain and simple",1105574400,"01 13, 2005",0.2225
1,A1DD5LYFQ3ZAOK,B00006AMSI,Laura I,"[0, 0]","I bought this scanner back in 2004. I do a lot of digital art and at the time I needed a scanner that will scan in very high resolution. Resolution can get up to 1200 x 2400 dpi. Usually I only need 600, but it's great having the option. 4 years later I'm still using it, and it still works perfectly. The only problem is it's slow, and a little loud when it's scanning. This is worse depending on how high you have the resolution set. But I wont be replacing it any time soon because for now it completely meets my needs.",4,"Still a good scanner, 4 years later",1222214400,"09 24, 2008",0.0658
2,A2E6TL7VP38K91,B00006AMSI,Liz I.,"[5, 5]","Even if you don't get the current rebate from Canon, this scanner is an amazing bargain.Pros (besides the price):The form factor is fantastic. It's small and light and saves desktop space, and is portable if you need that. And I really appreciate that it doesn't require a power adapter: one less cable and one less plug-in. It looks attractive (and goes very well with a PowerBook, by the way).Great scans. I'm using Mac OS X and VueScan, a third party scanning software which works with a multitude of scanners, many times better than the manufacturer's software.Acceptable speed. The speed isn't going to blow anyone away, but it certainly wasn't painfully slow, especially at 300 dpi, which is all I generally need. (Primarily digital presentations, web work, and the occasional old photograph.)I'm using it to replace a very expensive, but several years old HP ScanJet. The ScanJet is just taking up too much space, and is overkill for what I really need.Cons:Materials to be scanned must sit flush against the glass, so it isn't designed to scan 3 D objects, if you need that capability.",5,Amazing value for the money!,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",0.375
3,ACGTYE5R2EXVF,B00006AMSI,S. Gerber samthewebman,"[38, 41]","I read the great reviews here (and elsewhere) on the LiDE 30, prompting me to buy the newer, faster 50. I have USB 2.0 ports and wanted the better performance ? and wasn't disappointed! The 50 can scan a full 8.5x11 color image in less than 30 seconds at 300dpi, including several seconds for the scan mechanism to reposition itself afterward. The optional &quot;preview&quot; was so fast it wasn't worth timing. My guess is 5 seconds or so for the above preview.I won't rehash all the nice features of this scanner since many of you have read the LiDE 30 reviews. It seems to be an LiDE 30 with impressive USB 2.0 Hi-Speed performance added. It's also capable of generating 48bit color output and 16bit monochrome output, whereas the liDE 30 is half that, not that this is really important. 24bit is 16 million colors and 281 trillion colors is something I don't relate to.Aside from speed, I was pleased with the space saving design and attractive &quot;stainless steel&quot; appearance. The scanner bed has sufficiently high edges to allow me to easily position a sheet of paper in proper alignment, without it trying to climb over the edge. A lot of human engineering went into this product!Windows XP really loves this machine. The software installed without the slightest hiccup. This scanner is as hot-pluggable as any device could be. XP recognizes its presence and absence immediately. Even though the LiDE series requires no power source other than from the USB port (boy do I enjoy the absence of another power brick!), I prefer to remove power from the scanner when it's not in use and it's a snap to pull the cable from the front USB port. (If you're curious, the LiDE requires 498mA against the standard USB output of 500mA. Probably 10% or less of the current draw of CCD technology scanners.)The package comes with some impressive looking software but all I wanted to do was scan images from PaintShop Pro and Adobe Acrobat and enjoy convenience copying. There is appx. 500MB of software if you load everything but I only installed the XP Driver and the CanoScan Toolbox. I did this not because I didn't want the other software, but really to see if the scanner would be fully functional without it (including the 4 &quot;one-touch&quot; buttons).I was glad to discover that the CanoScan Toolbox has everything that's required to Copy, Scan to a program (PaintShop Pro?), Scan to email, and Scan to a file (including a PDF file). You may like some of the other programs they offer if you want to try your hand at OCR, manage photo albums, and similar tasks. I did install the Adobe Photoshop Essentials 2.0 because I respect Adobe software and wanted to see what this entry level image editing program can do. Not counting the 95MB for Photo Essentials, the driver and Toolbox took only around 30MB or less out of the potential 500MB.The CanoScan Toolbox is very functional, impressive software. It allows you to setup 7 discrete type of scans with their unique resolutions, scan method (color, grayscale, etc.), paper size, your printer, specify your pet image editing program, etc. Then, you can associate your choice of 4 of these 7 functions with any of the 4 physical buttons at the front of the scanner. Canon has preset reasonable defaults.There are a couple negatives to be aware of. CIS technology, as has been reported by some LiDE 30 users, is sensitive to the item scanned hugging the glass. This is quite true and even a thin pamphlet will produce a distorted scan, especially at page edges and corners where there's curl. The solution is to press the lid down to flatten the page against the glass. Consider this if you do a lot of scanning from magazines and books.Another negative is my mild disappointment with the automated scan functions and single button functions --- a bit overrated in my opinion. Scanning to a program or file creates a JPG file first and then saves it and/or gives it to the image editing program. The quality of that JPEG was not to my satisfaction and I'd rather have the imaging program manage the scan and work with the raw scan data.PDF files can be created automatically but may be a bit bloated and can have a grayish background. This can be improved considerably by choosing &quot;Text Enhancement&quot; or &quot;Black and White&quot; as the scanning mode. If you want to create an occasional PDF file, the Toolbox can do it for you rather easily.The scanner appears to be durable. I scanned 120 8.5x11 color glossies over a 2 day period and it didn't breathe hard or make any strange sounds. It's also pretty quiet, in my view, although a few have complained it was loud. It could easily be used in a home office environment while you're talking on the phone.Today I called Canon's technical support to ask some &quot;how-to&quot; questions. It was not toll-free but I got through very quickly and the technician was extremely courteous, knowledgeable, and generous of his time. After one year, they will continue to help but at only $10 an incident. Very good first impression here!I hope you learned something about the LiDE 50 and its software and technology from this review. If you're on the fence between Canon and another vendor, you'd likely be happy with the LiDE series. If you're on the fence between the LiDE 30 and 50, you'd save $$$ and probably be just as happy with the 30 if you don't have USB 2.0 capability or plan to install a PCI USB 2.0 adapter. (Canon explicitly supports a wide array of Adaptec adapters.)Good luck with your decision and enjoy the Canon experience if you take the plunge.",5,The LiDE 30 or LiDE 50? - Depends on your USB Capability,1064448000,"09 25, 2003",0.3329
4,A39VFY3ZY0QQH9,B00006AMSI,X. Pert,"[0, 0]","I have been using the Canon LIDE 30 scanner for seven years and it continues to do an excellent job for me. It is relatively small (measuring 10.1 x 15.1 x 1.3 inches), compact and light. It does not have a power transformer or cable, but gets its power from the computer via the USB cable. It will slip into my computer bag and is conveniently portable. It scans pages up to 8.5 x 11.7 inches (not legal size), will scan in black and white, grayscale or color, and will scan resolutions up to 1200 x 2400 dpi. The scanning speed varies according to page size and color and resolution selection. The scanner comes with its own set of software, which gives the user the ability to control scanning quality and is not too difficult to learn. This includes a limited Special Edition copy of Scansoft OCR scanning software; I have since bought the full copy, which I continue to update. Buttons on the front of the unit provide quick access to scan your document, print a copy, or email your document. The innovative Z-Lid also adjusts to allow scanning thick documents or books.I regularly use the scanner to copy documents, including photos, to digital files so that I don't need to retain lots of paper. I have found it to be a great convenience and highly recommend it. Presumably its successor scanner has only gotten better.Unfortunately, Windows 7 is incompatible with this scanner, so I have kept my older Windows XP computer as a scanning station.",5,An Excellent General Purpose Scanner,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",0.2682
