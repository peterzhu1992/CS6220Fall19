10,A33TRNCQK4IUO7,B00004Z5SB,guillermoj,"[2, 3]","I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging (envelopes, boxes, plastic mailers) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses, codes, instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging. Even if you tend not to be a person who recycles, these will serve you well in case you need to return a purchase using the same package that it came in.Easy to peel and can be used for addressing using computer software or just as good to peel off and write over them by hand. Priced reasonably and there is little else to say about labels. If you need them, these are as good as it gets for the reasons highlighted above.If you use labels exclusively for mailings on new envelopes, you might be able to save a few dollars and buy another Avery product that has more labels for a similar price.",5,This labels are a must for those who like to recycle packaging,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",0.4505

Avery also provides plenty of software templates on their website for you to use. Just go to [...] and search for 5163 (this information is on the label packaging too). They provide many premade label designs in Word Doc format and blank templates for other applications like InDesign and Photoshop. Also, the TrueBlock feature really does block out everything behind the label, which is great when you're reusing old boxes for shipping. Overall, I'm very happy with these labels.",4,Works great,1284854400,"09 19, 2010",0.2162
12,A3S15YGZ6W6EV2,B00004Z5SB,K. Varraso,"[0, 0]","I have reviewed several label products in the past, and have always found Avery to create a quality product, which does everything it says it will do, and will make you look fabulous and resourceful in the office, which can't hurt at employee review time. :-) These labels are no exception. They have permanent sticking power and are a strong enough white that nothing will show through the label. This is important now that so many companies are trying to be green by recycling old shipping cartons. If your company doesn't do this yet, suggest that they do so. It will save them money (green!) when they don't buy new shipping cartons and reduces the cost of waste removal (more green!). AND, it keeps cartons out of landfills, which is the greenest part of the whole deal.Back to the labels. A while back, I reviewed some labels that had Microsoft Word templates you could load onto a computer and design the labels of your dreams. I commented that most companies have rules against anyone but the IT department loading software onto their computers, which made the software less than practical for the people who use these at work. Avery has now solved this problem: they still offer the Microsoft word uploads, but you can also go to their web site and design the labels of your dreams without putting anything on your work machine. I tried the Microsoft Word add-on software and was impressed by the results.My project was to pack up some old summer clothes in old copy paper boxes, labeling each box top and bottom so that they could be retrieved easily. Copy paper boxes are printed with many dark colors and graphics, and if the label was going to have a show through problem, this was the time for it. The no show through technology worked like a charm - nothing shows through onto the face of the label, and it's a cinch to find my outgrown bathing suits - won't fit again in this lifetime.Why four stars instead of five? Because they're labels, not a cure for cancer. I like the labels, but it's not like we're going out or anything. :-)",4,Labels that help you ship green!,1284508800,"09 15, 2010",0.1454
13,A3O8Z6IZ0VU3BB,B00004Z5SB,Laura B. Kindle Fan,"[0, 0]",I used these as name tags in my classroom on folders. I also used them on boxes that I packed away for future use. I mailed a present to my sister in another state with some of them. They have worked great for all three purposes. They stick well and don't peel up around the edges. The markers (sharpie type) don't bleed on them. They are very effective for many purposes besides just shipping. And they do a great job for their main purpose as well.,5,I used these as name tags in my classroom and they are great,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",0.2698
14,A16AXQ11SZA8SQ,B00004Z5SB,MamaBear007 MamaBear007,"[0, 0]","I send lots of gifts to my out-of-state grandchildren, and I love to reuse boxes I already have -- think of all the stuff Amazon sends you (what a perfect way to save a tree by recycling boxes)!One of the drawbacks of reusing boxes is that you will have to scribble out all the previous markings from the box. Not so with these labels with TrueBlock Technology! They have a gray coating on the back of each label, which efficiently hides even the darkest marks, even on white boxes.The only drawback is that the gray coating makes these labels less sticky, making me wonder if they might peel off the package in transit. To prevent this, I put clear tape on all sides of the label (just to be safe), and it's a small inconvenience, because I don't have to spend tons of time scribbling out all the markings when I send gifts to my grandchildren any more.One more benefit... These don't hang up in my HP Photosmart inkjet printer, and (as long as I don't run a wet finger through the fresh ink) the ink doesn't smear.",4,Really does block other labels!,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",0.3805

They were affixed to those brown padded envelopes and they stuck on really well. They are sticky and re-positionable but ONLY if you pull it off very quickly.

These labels can be peeled off without much effort, which is great if your recipient wants to reuse the box, but not so great if you want to ensure that the label stays put and can't be removed.
