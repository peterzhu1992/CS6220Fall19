Dent Aragorn,"[18, 20]","It's nearly all-plastic (feels cheap but it looks okay from a distance) with the exception of the blade itself which appears to be thin steel and the bolts that keep it together. The only assembly needed is attaching the handle (just push it in) onto the blade assembly.The trimmer features:- inch and metric rulers- a protective guard rail- a blade latch hook- a largely meaningless 10-year limited warranty (you pay for shipping, does not cover the blade)Putting it to the test, I found that it does cut photo paper well. The cut is straight and the blade cuts through the paper with no difficulty. Because of the guard rail, I doubt that you can squeeze more than a few sheets at a time but that's not a big issue for me because I will be cutting photos only and I doubt that I will ever stack more than 2 or 3 sheets at the most.Inside the box there's a note that says that Swingline is GBC's new name.One (almost) good comment on the seller. Shipping was quick and the item came in perfect condition but the packaging wasn't exactly state of the art.__________________________Six months update:Still cuts well so that self-sharpening claim on the blade may hold some truth.

I use it daily for work, many times a day--I sent out samples of products and for sample labels I just hand cut the labels before sending and also cut out the mailing labels. That means lots of cutting, and some of it on sticky backed surfaces. I also use paper cutters in my art.This one, by far, outperformed all the others, even my commercial ones. It's amazing that it's so lightweight, but cuts so easily, even bigger stacks of paper.Most seem to cut by shaving the blade up close to the metal bar rather than by having a good and sharp blade. This means more resistance and pulling---This one is a light easy pull but fast and accurate cut. Far better.My other cutters tend to make the paper move, crooked, so precise cuts are not as easy--this one kept the paper just where I place it for straight cuts.Also a few of my others have a large protector so you can't easily see where you are cutting. This has a small bar. Whereas I wound up removing the protector on some other paper cutters because it was in the way of my site, I can leave this one on, meaning fingers are protected but I can still see.This one is longer than may others so long pieces of paper are no issueAnd the guides on the cutter make it simple to align items straight, whether vertically or horizontally.Best cutter I've owned in years, for sure.",5,Best paper cutter out there,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",0.0437

And considering that one of those institutional ones can cost 3 times as much, this is not bad.Except for the blades and the green rail, the body is completely made of plastic. It's light weight, which means it'll be easy to move around, but it also means that when you lift the blade, you will need to push the body down, otherwise the whole body just comes up.Function:You use a cutter mainly to make long straight cuts or for craft work when scissors won't work or you don't want to use a ruler and a craft knife. As such the cutter works well enough. The website says you can cut up to 10 sheets at once, which seems generous but doable with a lot of effort and I mean a lot. I probably wouldn't do more than 6 pieces to avoid dulling the blade or breaking something. In any case, the green safety rail limits the amount of paper you can feed into the blade.Thinking to the future, I think I would use this cutter mainly for precision work, rather than heavy duty cutting due to it's lite nature.Safety:It has a small lock that prevents the blade when not in use. It is definitely safer than the institutional cutters I've used before but it is still very sharp and can definitely take fingers off.Overall, an inexpensive light version of an institutional strength cutter.

The product also lacks the ability to adjust the edge, thus you may have a harder time getting uniform cuts most of the time.

I'm very happy with the way it works, although it takes a little practice to cut exactly where you want it to. The blade is SUPER sharp (my bleeding knuckle assures you) and the cutter should only be used by adults. It cuts up to 10 regular pages (about 5 pages of construction paper) with ease. In fact, it works better with 2 or more pages than with one.One hint I learned is that you need to hold the paper very securely with your left hand, so it can't be pulled crooked as you lower the blade with your right hand. Also, as you lower the cutting bar to cut, use a slight inward pressure on the handle, to keep the blade slicing right up against the guide.This is a great little paper cutter and I'm looking forward to all those late nights when we'll be chopping and pasting.",5,"Works great, affordable, and a lifesaver for parents of school aged kids!",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",0.3301

I wouldn't dream of trying to do these by hand with scissors.The guillotine might be fine for cutting coupons, or separating tax forms, or other things where it doesn't have to be precise. But I find that the drawing motion of the blade pulls the paper and, despite my best efforts, won't make an exactly perfect cut. With the rolling cutters, there's no issue at all. It's exactly perfect. Plus it's far easier and safer.This unit is pretty much all lightweight plastic and doesn't feel sturdy. The blade does lock with a safety catch, but I wouldn't want this around kids. It's fairly sharp.

This makes is much more difficult to line paper up if you are cutting to sizes of around 6 inches or less, which I very often am (cutting 12x12 scrapbook paper to 6x6).

35,A19NP8YYADOOSF,B00006IATH,N. Krumpe,"[2, 2]","In short, I am impressed by how very lightweight this trimmer is. If you want to be able to pick up your trimmer and easily move it to another room, I highly recommend this.If you want a little more detail...Paper trimmers usually have heavy wooden bases, probably so that they won't slide around during use. But that extra weight means that you can't easily move the trimmer from room to room if you are working on a project. By contrast, this Swingline &#34;Lite&#34; trimmer is probably about as light as it could possibly be and still remain functional. It is very easy to carry around with one hand.The base is a thin but sturdy plastic. In addition to the four corner supports on the bottom of the base, there is a fifth support in the center of the bottom. No doubt, this extra support is necessary on such a thin trimmer in order to keep it from sagging in the middle when holding your papers in place.I am also pleased with the accurate cuts. Some trimmers I've used seem to give me consistently crooked cuts. Not so with this Swingline. Whether I cut one or ten pieces of paper, I have never been disappointed by the cutting.If I could gripe about one thing (maybe worth a half-star deduction), it would be this: I find that the safety latch for locking down the arm is a little tricky to access. It's a bit &#34;tucked away&#34; under the arm itself, making it a little harder to lock and unlock. However, because it's such a light trimmer, it's easy to pick up the entire trimmer with one hand and tilt it until I find the latch.All in all, this is really a great trimmer. Don't be put off by the &#34;Lite&#34; in its title.",5,"Great trimmer, accurate cutting, despite being Lite",1391644800,"02 6, 2014",0.2745

This Swingline is much lighter and for me, who uses it only occasionally, perfect. I have had no problems with its operation and everything works great; it also cuts a straight line on several sheets of paper, which is the most I would use. It is a much cheaper-quality product than the heavy wooden trimmer. If I could have just one I would pick the more expensive product as I am sure it will perform better over time as well as last longer. The advantage of this Swingline trimmer is that it is light and portable and can be stored easily in small areas.Another good use for this trimmer would be as a second trimmer, since it is 15 inches long. It is a good price compared to the heavy 15-inch wooden trimmers. If you do a lot of trimming and have the room, you could use a sturdy wooden guillotine trimmer for everyday usage and then this longer lighter one for speciality trimming of longer/wider items.All in all, recommended for light use, but especially as a second trimmer.*****",4,Fine Lightweight Cutter For the Price,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",0.3645

Previously, I had bought a cheap paper cutter and it just didn't do the job and basically 'ate' my paper because it tore it up so badly. This works so much better, and the blade seems to be quite sharp. I will say that it seems to work better with more than one sheet of paper at one time. If you are cutting a long single sheet of paper, then I would recommend that you hold it down in the middle/opposite end of the way the blade swings or it could possible raise up some (the paper itself). Sort of hard to explain, but it may happen. What I did was take a piece of cardboard and set it on top of the paper so it stays stable. If all else fails, just flip the paper upside down and cut the part you were having issues with from the top. One thing I don't really understand is the bar that goes across- next to the blade. If this was adjustable, it would be great; but I haven't seen or found a way to lower it so it is pretty pointless.
