3,A3OFJES10PZGEH,B00004SDB1,"[0, 0]","I bought it here it was supposed to be NEW and Genuine.But I got an opened unit, NO seal, NO yellow cover, NO instructions, NO orig box, it was just wrapped hastily in bubble wrap (small bubbles single layer) and put in an already used amazon box with cracks. Upon inspection, the roller was dusty and had hair on it!I left a poor review for the seller, but he begged me to delete the review and for shipping refund. If anything I should have returned the item but I needed to use it. Upon use it leaked all over the place, I had to spend a long time maintaining the unit and wiping with dry (not wet) paper towels. It worked for a day and then slowly it leaked all over again! The fax came in all totally smudged with ink. I thought my machine was old and had a tech come over to look, We replaced the toner and it worked fine, WTH?! I pay good money for bad crap, never again! $65 here vs $99 @ Office Depot, but you get what you pay for!",2,I will not buy this on Amazon ever again!,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",SN,-0.2655
