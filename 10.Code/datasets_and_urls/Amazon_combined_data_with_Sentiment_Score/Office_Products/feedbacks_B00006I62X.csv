I looked at so many other brands and styles and for the money, this was the best bargain. The movement is not fluid because it's plastic on plastic, but like I said, it does the job.",4,Good for the price,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",0.155

When the included rubber feet are applied the unit does not slide around and is at a comfortable angle. It's not really adjustable, but for the price there is no beating it.",4,Perfectly functional,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",0.5483
2,A37MH7ICH80QOX,B00006I62X,Kate McMurry,"[0, 0]","This is a good quality foot rest. It is made of sturdy material and sits firmly in place without moving on the wooden floor where I use it. I would imagine it would do the same on a standard, plasticchair mat. I does exactly what I need, lift my feet to take pressure off my low back.Highly recommended.",5,Excellent foot rest,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",0.0198
3,A25TNBMJ4ZO7RD,B00006I62X,M. Potvin,"[0, 0]","I have a bad lower back and currently enrolled in physical therapy. I have pain going down the back of one leg. To me it seemed as though propping up that foot alleviated the foot pain. I had a more expensive foot rest in my cart and decided to give a cheaper model a try first to see if it cut down on my leg pain. FWIW - It has a bit, but not entirely, now onto the review.As others alluded to, this is an expensive piece of plastic. It is very cheaply made. It has two levels that you can chose from a higher or lower resting level. This has a rocker like motion so that you're feet aren't in a set position all the time. However, this rocking motion is not fluid, and is downright noisy.It does tend to stay in place well, and serves its purpose. I would say that there are better choices out there.",3,Gets the job done - that's about all it does,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",-0.1593
4,A3S3VSXEFXBMRC,B00006I62X,Natasha Chernavska,"[0, 0]","Originally, I have written a good review: I have got this thing to use in the office, I like my feet elevated. It has two height settings, so it is even more convenient than it looks. I personally like it a lot.However after just a couple months of using this thing, I pierced it with my heel very easily, and I didn't put a lot of weight on it. It's very fragile and won't work for girls in heels. Very disappointed.",1,Very fragile!,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",0.154
5,A3Q9HY0LU7MN6E,B00006I62X,N. Cousino,"[3, 3]",This foot rest fits nicely under my desk at work and is a welcome relief for staying comfortable while sitting at my desk all day. A particularly nice feature is that it is adjustable so that I can change my position if needed. For the price I think this product is well worth it.,4,Great product for the price,1186963200,"08 13, 2007",0.6135
6,A1CMD08Z49PGKQ,B00006I62X,okiedan Pro Bono Publico,"[1, 1]","This is not of the same quality as the Kensington foot rest. I now have both it and this one.It is a smaller version and does not have the same range of motion and comfortable gel foot pads.BUT, it is far cheaper.So in balancing the function versus the price it is a very acceptable solution to leg pain when working for prolonged periods at a computer desk.I was needing another foot rest at my L shaped computer desk but did not want to pay the high price of the Kensington model.When balancing the cost and usability of this foot rest I am pleased with my purchase. It provides most of the same qualities of the more expensive options. It is worth the price asked and I find it to be restful.",4,Provides support and moves easily.,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",0.3408
