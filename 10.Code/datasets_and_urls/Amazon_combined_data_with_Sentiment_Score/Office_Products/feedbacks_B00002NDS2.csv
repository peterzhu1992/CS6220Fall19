0,ALS9E01HVAVNM,B00002NDS2,B. Cooper,"[1, 1]","It works smoothly in the labeler and the backing is easy to remove. The drawback is that it doesn't stick very well to hard plastic surfaces or in cold temperatures. I wanted to label some oversize plastic storage bags in my garage, but they fell right back off. They work best indoors, on non-slick surfaces.",4,serves the purpose,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",0.1737
1,AFXTKAO0CB354,B00002NDS2,C. Weaver,"[0, 0]",Not much to say here. This is the 1/2&#34; size and I order a smaller size by mistake. (My own fault!!!) This is a perfect size for what I normally use this tape for and it's just as good as the 1/4&#34; size. The only problem I've run into on the this tape is being able to peel the back off the tape so I can stick it on a surface. I don't have long finger nails so it's hard sometime to get the backing off and instead of the tab the old plastic style tape used to give you to get ahold of the backing these newer tapes make you peel the label off from a cut down the middle and for me that's a bit hard. Otherwise no complains.,5,This Size I Really Wanted.....,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",-0.099
2,A1PV5T5S4D5NPI,B00002NDS2,Duane G. Jacobs,"[0, 0]","I have been using Dymo labelers since the 1970's. They have changed a bit over the years. Now everything is electronic and computerized to some degree. Well, these labels are perfect for any application that requires identification. I highly recommend these labels because they break open in the middle from the rear, making them a snap to apply.",5,Very handy.,1345248000,"08 18, 2012",0.2241
3,A26X7W5UM5QFT4,B00002NDS2,Grits,"[3, 3]","I only wish the label maker itself had better directions on how to install and set up for the various widths of tape available. But that is no fault of the replacement tape itself. The lengthwise split in the backing makes removal of the backing VERY easy. Additionally, it allows the user to stick the label on across only one half of the label first to make sure it's straight and get out any bubbles or creases - then remove the other half of the backing to smooth the label on the rest of the way. Very good design.",5,Works just fine,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",0.55
4,A1JTTJ7M7EC7Q7,B00002NDS2,Hyperjump,"[0, 0]",Great tape but hard to find. There are no local retailers selling this product. Was informed that due to new designs this tape not selling enough to carry on local shelves. Thank heavens for Amazon.

6,A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B00002NDS2,jjceo,"[0, 0]",A simple cartridge for your Dymo printer that prints black letters on white background. It is 1/2 inch wide and 23 feet long. I like the spilt back that is easy to peel off so you can stick the label quickly. The Amazon price is very good as it is cheaper with free delivery than our local stores.,5,Good quality at a good price!,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",0.3653
7,A1JFNZ4UAMEZN3,B00002NDS2,Joe496 kittybaby,"[6, 7]",Although my ordering of this product was totally accidental I decided to keep it since it is such a wonderful product. I just will not run out of tape for quite a while. I would highly recommend this product and remember the most expensive label makers are not necessarily the best.2-16-2012I did not open this product right away but when I did I found the incorrect item had been sent not just by one company but two; neither of which are Amazon.com. I have actually stopped doing business with one company because they would not allow me to return the item.,5,Dymo makes a great product.,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",0.0821
8,AYXVKR3QNGB7D,B00002NDS2,JulesTBear,"[0, 0]","Yeah, it prints just great?!? It's 4 stars only because I do think it's a touch expensive for printed words on sticky tape, but I'm also not labeling my entire house because... hello... I'm not a weirdo like that. Just would like my husband to NOT use my back up hard drive.",4,Well... it works,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",0.2795
9,A10PEXB6XAQ5XF,B00002NDS2,Michael Gallagher,"[2, 2]","This labeling tape is pretty good, and it is darn near impossible to screw it up: drop it into the label machine, type up your label(s), have it print, then peel off the backing and apply. I actually love these labels vs. what I have used in the past as it is truly a print, peel, and stick type of label with no mess and crisp, professional-looking fonts. This tape is also much better than the tape that originally came with the machine as this tape is much longer and will last for a lot more labels.To top everything else off as I type this review, I saved a little over $6 as the price I paid on Amazon was $13.59 vs. $19.99 for the same exact roll at the Office Depot down the street.",5,Excellent Tape and $6 Cheaper Here than at Office Depot,1341014400,"06 30, 2012",0.7457

Dymo labeling takes does it in a way very easy to use, is economical and stays put. The back peels off easily and application is nice. If I peel them off they come off clean (so far) without adhesive left behind.",5,Dymo does it,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",0.382
