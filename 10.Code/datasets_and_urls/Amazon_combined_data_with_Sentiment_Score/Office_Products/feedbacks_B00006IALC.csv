0,A1NQAYUMIAT0H0,B00006IALC,AMT,"[1, 2]","Like most people, I have waayyyyy to many electronic devices and find it challenging to store and charge it in an organized way. I bought this for that purpose. The mesh material allows for great ventilation while charging or storing. Looks clean and organized. The product is very well constructed and solid. You don't feel like it is cheap and flimsy. Will last a long time and looks great on our desk.",5,Holds My Electronics,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",0.3301
1,A1DDEEB79OIRBR,B00006IALC,Florida Pat,"[1, 2]","Originally I bought this in order to stack a modem and a wireless router. However, when I got it I decided to use it in my office to keep small electronics organized.I put a telephone on the top shelf and then a collection of chargers and adapters on the second shelf. The third shelf has earplugs, small cameras, and other electronics. They're now organized and within easy reach.I like the mesh; it looks good in an office and it would have worked well for the modem and router as it would have allowed air flow at the bottom of the units.",5,Excellent for small electronics storage,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",0.2645

3,A35HUT8MQMT21L,B00006IALC,Manny,"[0, 0]","I have this product on top of my computer table shelf. It looks like it is tilted a bit backwards and the shelf's front edge is pointing down instead of up to prevent the contents from sliding down, I guess the reason for the slight tilt back. It found the ideal place for my purposes on top of my computer shelf. 5 stars",5,looks good and well made looks durable,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",0.3053
4,A1HAUSCAQSGV3L,B00006IALC,MLP,"[0, 0]",I've always thought well of Rolodex products and this was no exception. It certainly seems sturdy enough and it looks nice--came just as pictured.Not a plastic-y product like many similar products of this type.,5,Sturdy,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",0.2868
5,A1PQ4LDLJMO3KW,B00006IALC,Picklewacket,"[1, 2]","this came bent and just warped looking. When siting on a desk it takes up waaay too much space, but I suppose mounted on a wall it would be more useful. I just seems so large, bulky and not very convenient.",2,large and bulky,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",0.2158
6,A1JNA5RWCEMT68,B00006IALC,Raymund C. Vergara Ray,"[0, 0]",Simple and good design. I can put it anywhere and it looks good. I like that it has hooks for hanging on the wall.,5,Good for organizing.,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",0.414
