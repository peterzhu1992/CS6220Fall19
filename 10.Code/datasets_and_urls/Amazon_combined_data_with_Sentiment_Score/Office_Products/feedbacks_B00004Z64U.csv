1,A2J39GPS8D4YJI,B00004Z64U,Booklover Jerry,"[1, 2]","Avery File Folder Labels are fast and easy to use. The paper is nice quality and they are easy to peel off. It works well on my ink jet printer and states it works with laser printers too. The labels are on acid free paper. I like that the labels are not side by side connected together like some labels I have used in the past but the labels have spaces between them (side by side) so they come off easy. The labels are close together on top and bottom but they don't stick together. Has anyone used labels like I had where the labels hang together or stick to the paper when peeled off? Ugh, I hate that. This one will not do that.I also like that it came with four free samples of Avery Note Tabs that was a pleasant bonus. Another great feature Avery has is free templates online for Microsoft Word and an Avery Design and Print. Going online, I found 44 templates listed for the file folder labels but about a handful of templates that will work with these specific file labels. They are basic but get the job done and look good printed out. Another freebie is the Avery Wizard for Microsoft Word for more creating. I use Wordperfect X5 and the templates work fine in it. I have yet to explore the other software listed but I just thought it was a great added bonus for using their templates. I will buy from Avery because they not only give quality labels, but go the extra distance and give more to boot.",5,Does The Job,1279843200,"07 23, 2010",0.4027

If you call Avery's Consumer Service Center (1-800-462-8379 number listed on their web site as Brea, California) you will be given several choices of support all of which route you to their customer, product, and software staff in Manilla, Philippines.I wanted to get more information on where their products are manufactured. The operator I spoke with and her supervisor both assured me that all Avery products are made in the U.S.A. in Brea, California, but some of the raw materials may be from other countries. They were unable to route me to anyone in Brea to confirm this information. After examining the packaging I have I found a sticker that said Made in Mexico. Other Avery products I have say either Mexico or China. None say U.S.A.I am very hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with their products.**************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the Consumer Service Center in Manilla:I have used sharpie pens on all my well-used file folders and decided to try these file folder labels by Avery. I was surprised how well they blocked out the old hand-written tabs with clean new labels. The TrueBlock Technology is simply a silver backing on the sticky side of the label.As for the templates, I downloaded the Avery 8366 template for MS-Word on Avery's website, but was disappointed that I could not get the text to center on the label when I increased the text to a legible size. So, I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0. It took some time to download and install, but well worth the time. The wizard was easier to use than the template. It comes with a few colorful graphics to make your labels interesting. I was able to use a big text size and center the text vertically and horizontally.Once I had my labels printed out, it was easy to peel and place the labels right in the file drawers, and I had a whole file drawer of easy-to-read folder tabs.A couple side notes. 1) Avery required that you give them your name and email for downloading a simple template which I didn't like. In addition during the Avery Wizard 4.0 install there is a box automatically checked to also install the Avery Ask toolbar and make it your default search engine. You can easily uncheck it, but rather tricky of Avery to set as the default to install additional software on your computer. 2) If you try and remove the label on your file folders, they do not easily release and you'll peel off some of your file folder with the label.Again, this may be a useful product, but very disappointing that Avery continues to outsource all their customer support and manufacturing!",1,"Like the product, but don't like Avery business practices.",1292889600,"12 21, 2010",0.1057

Every time I buy an off-brand just to save a few cents, I always end up with paper jams or unusable smudged, smeared, or incorrectly placed labels. Avery products are always well-made and supported by every device that I use in my office. The Avery File Folder Labels are no exception.Speaking of software and formats, even if the program you have doesn't support Avery (I can't imagine which one that would be...) you can go to their website and download templates or even use their website to print! (This one is great because our office includes not only PC's but also several Linux machines).Lastly, I was happily surprised to see the inclusion of 2 Box Tops.

4,AY3XPKRAMKKY7,B00004Z64U,C. G. King,"[6, 6]","Since I usually print only one label at a time, I'm pleased a sheet will go through the printer many times correctly. I've used various software programs for printing these labels and they always come out looking great, plus a single sheet doesn't seem to be affected by the heat from the laser printer and even after many trips through, the labels still release cleanly, then stick well to the intended surface. Even better, they can be removed cleanly when no longer needed.I use them for file folders as intended, but also for jars of stored goods in the kitchen. These may be multiple jars of the same thing, e.g. jelly, or one jar of a newly ground spice. I've given up thinking I'll remember what's in all those little spice jars. There's plenty of room on these labels for the name of the contents and the date.I don't always use the printer. I keep a sheet of the labels in the kitchen for quick labeling and just write on them with a pen or marker. When I reuse the jar, the labels peel off in one piece and don't leave an annoying residue.My latest labor saver is to write the name of a device on one end of the label and fold it in half over the cable that device uses so there's no more guessing which cable goes to the scanner and which to the camera, etc. etc. That worked so well, I labeled all my stored chargers so I now know which is which and don't have to try multiple plugs to get a fit. Some things don't need charging often enough for me to remember which of the dozen little corded black boxes is the right one. I've seen tags you can buy for this purpose, but why spend the money when these labels work so well. In addition, if the cord is much longer than it needs to be I include several loops when I fold the label over it, effectively shortening it to a more manageable length.Now I'm beginning to label various items in my home discretely on the bottom or back to aid my kids when they inherit it all. My daughter suggested it since she feared she wouldn't remember the details and dates of Great Uncle Sam's baby cup and like items. Because the labels stick well, but release cleanly they seemed a good choice for this labeling. If they are too big, I cut them in half. With the printer you can get a lot of info on the label.I'm really pleased with this size and the quality and will re-buy.

Like most other reviewers I tend to try to use and reuse file folders and have at one time or another resorted to writing over labels with magic markers or sharpies or sticking labels over others to the extent that the folder looks, well less than professional.While I do not use the labels in my printer these come with free software online and templates that are easy to use.An added bonus is the generous Box Tops for Education coupons on each package. Since we have teachers in the family and grandchildren in school we are aware of the amount of money your school can earn by saving these coupons.

I've used other kinds of Avery labels in the past and they tend to come unstuck after about 3-5 years. I bought those labels 15 years ago so hopefully they've fixed that. The problem with the software is that the lettering can look fine in Avery Wizard (when using WORD), but when you print or go to print preview, you may find that part of the lettering is actually off-label, particularly if you like to mess with different font types and sizes. So you have to go back and forth through trial and error until you get it right. Maybe by exploring more I'll find a better solution, but you'd think the text you see in the wizard's label box would appear the same when you print it out.",3,"Fine labels, mediocre software.",1284854400,"09 19, 2010",0.1624

The reason I say this is not only because of their high quality labels and products, but because when you buy it, you're pretty much guaranteed to find a template already in your office productivity software (e.g. MS Word/Excel). Avery now has the added feature of being able to design the labels directly from their website and print (Go to their website, and then click on Design & Print. Avery is truly going the extra mile to make the process of printing labels as simple as possible.I've been using Avery labels for years, and they continue to improve upon their already excelent products. This product in particular adds a special feature that they call 'Trueblock Technology'. For most people, this would seem like trivial. A label is a label, whats the point? For those of you that want to re-use old folders, and completely mask the previous label/marking, this label does the trick. After printing out a sheet of labels, I placed them over folders with permanent markers markings, old printed labels, pens, and more. On regular labels, you may be able to see faint outlines of what was written before. With these labels, I was unable to detect any previous marking. Works as advertised!There are 25 sheets of labels, each with 30 labels, for a total of 750 labels. Whether you print or write directly on these file folder labels, what amounts to less than 3 cents per label, you can't go wrong with this. Unlike some of their other labels, this particular one worked well with my Epson Photosmart printer as well as my ancient HP LaserJet 8150 (If your printer has the option to, be sure to specify that you are printing on a label versus a regular sheet of paper).Needless to say, I highly recommend this product.",5,Excellent products as always,1282003200,"08 17, 2010",0.2438

Well I couldn't wait to find out if that was true. I have been making file folders for my home office files by reusing old folders from our business. I have usually used a felt tip pen to write the name on the folder. That is not a very attractive way to set up a system, but I tried some old file folder labels and the previously printed title just bled right through. I had a ready made experiment for these new labels and I'm very glad to say that they did truly block the writing underneath and it did not bleed through at all. Now my personal files look like I actually took some time to set them up correctly (or at least correctly as per my definition).The Avery Company has made available free templates and software to use with their products. I had to give them my name and email address in order to access the templates I was looking for. The good thing is that the templates will help me utilize the labels more efficiently. These labels are for both laser and ink jet printers and are acid free. Included in this package was a sample pack of four repositionable note tabs.

16,A1TP2RW7KDI5AZ,B00004Z64U,John Werner JWW,"[0, 1]","I love to reuse file folders. I know, file folders are pretty cheap and why bother? Well, convenience is the main reason and not being wasteful, maybe, that's the other. Anyway, I've developed that habit over the years and I've used my share of tricks to do it which include turning the folder inside out and using the other side of the tab, liquid paper, correction film, and stick-on labels. Labels have become the preferred choice for me and that is where these improved Avery ones with their super opaque cover technology shine.Avery labels are simply the best brand you can buy. A label isn't something that cannot be improved upon and Avery continues to be the leader in the finish of the actual label, the adhesives, and their TrueBlock Technology which makes the label 100% opaque to anything under it. No more x-ray vision of the previous writing, or previous label, underneath makes for a neat job of folder presentation. They feed flawlessly through all my printers, and if only printing a single the sheets will hold up extremely well for repeated trips through. The quality is top-notch and you can use a fine point sharpie to write on and it is still crisp without the fattened bleed look to your written labels. The adhesive never curls and I have even been able to remove them with care to simply put a new label on when I've had several to build up.This particular size is truly versatile too. I've used them as labels on so many different items that I am addicted to having these on hand. You can use them not just in the office, but for lots of creative labeling. You can label audio/video cables by wrapping them around the cable, price sundry items if you have a business, label dates on items stored in your fridge or freezer, put a date you opened something such as olive oil so you know it is still usable, the list goes on. They stick and they remain readable under and/or heavy use conditions. These labels are worth the money and you may find yourself addicted too.

I use them regularly at work for their intended purpose, and I also use them at home to label stuff going into the freezer. They do stay on even when frozen, but are easiest to remove while still frozen. If they get wet before I try to remove the label, some adhesive has to be scrubbed off.I doubt Avery matters for the freezer application, but if you want a professional result for more traditional uses, Avery and name brand printer toner are a must.I've tried several different generic brands -- from all three big office retailers -- and the letters get smeared or flake off when applying the labels. Add generic toner, and the problem gets so bad that the printing becomes almost illegible. With generic toner these smear a little bit, but with the name brand toner (I've used these in both HPs and Canons), there's no problem. The generic labels might seem a lot cheaper, but these are well worth the extra dough.As far as True Block goes, well, I don't really care, but it does work. The labels have an opaque backing between the paper and adhesive, which doesn't allow anything below it to show through. I usually just remove the label if I'm going to re-use a file folder, because I'm just going to covering up the damaged area with another label anyway. True Block seems more useful for shipping applications than for file folders.

I printed mine using a Lexmark X3350 Inkjet printer. There were no problems with the label sheet feeding through the printer. The labels hold the ink without smearing or blurring or bleeding. Furthermore, no labels detached from the sheet while moving through the printer - a disaster which has happened to me using lower quality labels. Yet they are easily peeled from the sheet when it's time to apply them. Used over an existing label or writing, they are truly opaque. Nothing shows through.About half my files are 1/3 cut Manila folders and the other half are 1/5 cut Pendaflex hanging folders. These labels are intended for the 1/3 cut folders and they work perfectly there. But I found that by restricting the text on the label to about 2 inches total width, I could easily use them on the 1/5 cut hanging folders as well. I just applied the new label to the old paper label insert and then folded over the excess.I recommend that you investigate the Design and Print Online feature available on Avery's website. It is far more flexible than a simple template. With it, I was able to create a text field for my labels that was short enough to fit on the 1/5 cut folders. You can select fonts, sizes, colors, styles, even add images to your labels. And you can save your layout for future use. The interface is a little strange and sometimes behaves in unexpected ways, but you'll easily enough get the hang of it with a bit of experimentation (and it has an Undo). I printed my first try on plain paper and then overlaid it on the label sheet to double check.The package contains 25 sheets of labels with 30 labels per sheet for a total of 750 labels. Searching Amazon, I find that there is also a 1500 label package but I don't see anything smaller than the 750 size.

While I found customer support helpful I had to speak to two people because the first technical support agent did not think this product worked in a laser printer and he had to transfer me someone who confirmed it did.I first went to the Avery website and put in my product number which brought up a bunch of information and options. One download would have added an Avery icon to Word and as I understand it a toolbar as well. I did not want this.When I tried to call Avery to figure out how to download a template that did not automatically add a toolbar to my screen the person helping me showed me what to do. I was able to save a template to word that I can use without adding any sort of icon or toolbar. I asked about using the product in my laser printer only to be told it did not work in a laser printer contrary to the packaging. When I questioned this he transferred me to another agent who confirmed it did.One concern for those who do not have massive amounts of file folder labels to print is that you can only put the labels through a printer once. If you don't use all the labels the first time you have to hand write on the remaining ones.One good thing is that there are instructions on each sheet explaining how to use the labels. While the sheet directs you to the Avery website for more information, it also includes a toll free phone number for the Consumer Service Center and another for Avery Software Support. While it took two people to address my concerns the representatives were very professional.The labels are big enough to cover old labels and there is no problem writing on them. They work fine. I have used a couple of sheets already.Overall this is a good product. I just wish the website was a bit more user friendly but there is customer support to help people like me who have trouble navigating the website.",4,Good Product but Template Download Process was Confusing for Me.,1281916800,"08 16, 2010",0.42

Hamon Super Mom,"[0, 1]","First let me say, these are AWESOME and I am so glad I had the opportunity to try them on a trial basis because I don't think I would have forked out the almost twenty bucks on something I wasn't sure about...but I would and will gladly fork it out now knowing they work as well as Avery claims, if not better. There are 750 in the package...but with all the uses that won't take long to use up.**QUALITY**Labels are labels, right? Nope! These are high quality labels that really do cover up any writing underneath, even if it was written in a broad tip Sharpie. This is accomplished because the labels have a gray backing where the adhesive is rather than just plain white single-layer paper like most labels. They are also a heavier weight paper than your basic labels meaning no tearing!! They adhesive is strong enough to stay put, yet releases smoothly if you wanted to remove it...without leaving behind any torn paper or yucky sticky goo...YAY for that because I am ALWAYS reusing file folders and renaming them.**PRINTING**I have printed these using Word and [...] version of Word...both print perfectly and line up perfectly without having to adjust the template's settings at all (I usually have to adjust them by 1/8th of an inch or so to line up perfectly)...but not with these!! I have used them in my inkjet printer without any problems as well as my laser printer. Usually my laser printer causes paper to curl due to the heat, but these don't do that. I often print only a few lables at a time and reuse the sheet later with some of the labels removed....I have had other labels catch and get stuck in the printer when doing this, but not with these...smooooooooth sailing!The uses for these are endless...not just for file folders. I use them to label my kids books & toys, totes that I use for storage items, little jars I store fresh ground spices in, and other personal items....they are great for writing on too, not just printing. The packaging Avery sells their labels in works great for storing them because it keeps the labels from bending or getting the corners torn up, yet is super easy to take a new sheet out or put one away for future use...without taking up a bunch of space. The label is the perfect height for the tabs on hanging file folders, but it a bit too long, so I just fold it over the back and it works perfectly. My filing cabinet now shows my OCD nature and is freakishly neat & organized thanks to Avery! My only gripe, and this is a rather pathetic one...I wish they came in colors to match my folders...I'd even settle on just plain manila. Then my filing cabinet would be a true work of art!!",5,Perfect for EVERYTHING!!! Not just folders!!,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",0.2939

34,A2NB2E5DXE319Z,B00004Z64U,S. Lionel,"[0, 1]","The biggest plus for the Avery 8366 File Folder Labels is Avery's TrueBlock technology which layers a semi-opaque gray layer to the back of the label, allowing it to hide most anything you may put it on top of. I know that for a lot of the labels I have I have to remove anything underneath as they'll show right through. For this alone the Avery labels are great.Other than that, they're normal-looking labels that are sized to put on tab-type file folders. Unlike a different style of Avery label I reviewed earlier, Microsoft Word 2010 did not have a template for these. Avery's web site has several options, including an 88MB program that runs independent of Word. A smaller helper toolbar for Word doesn't support Word 2010. At the basic level, a .doc file is provided which you can open in Word and fill it in, but this means you can't take advantage of automation features such as mail-merge, etc. This is not a fault of the labels themselves, but if you're going to use these you might want to know.The instructions for the labels say to not reuse the sheet, though it seems to work anyway for at least a few passes.",4,"TrueBlock works, convenient size",1284595200,"09 16, 2010",-0.0243

When I heard these labels were suppose to stop bleed-through, I bought a pack of folders to go with it, figuring it wouldn't work as advertised and I'd end up tossing some old files. I was shocked when they actually covered up the DARK writing underneath. I often use a very thick, black marker for writing on some folders, and these labels didn't allow the original writing to bleed through at all.
