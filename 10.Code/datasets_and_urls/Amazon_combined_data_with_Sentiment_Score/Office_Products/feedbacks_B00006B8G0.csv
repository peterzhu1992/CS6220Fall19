We use labels of various sizes constantly rather than getting envelopes and folders pre-printed as a cost saving measure and a way to offer easy customization of our brand to our clients.As others have stated here, a label is a label is a label...right? Not always. There are many factors that I look at when buying labels, especially in quantity:1. Price. Big variances between 'generic' and 3M, Avery, etc.2. Glue. Good glue won't come through the label.3. Adhesive Quality. Labels shouldn't come off an envelope (which could result in a dead letter), and they shouldn't come off in the printer (which could result in the need for a new printer).4. Ease of removing from sheet. If they are not easy to remove, the label can be easily torn. Sometimes I've had to use an X-acto knife to lift labels.Avery labels here are great value, and have the other characteristics of good labels.

These labels work just like conventional laser labels--just use Avery's template to print the labels you need. The magic is in the dark, vinyl-like coating on the sticky side of the label.

They're an Avery product, so the templates for using these labels are built into almost every application you're likely to use with them, so formatting the print data is a snap. What makes these labels different is their construction. They're thicker than the typical mailing label, with a white front and a dark gray sticky side. This makes the labels truly opaque, so that they block any previous writing or labels that they are applied over. I've tried to see through them, and I haven't been able to.

The basics:*The labels feed smoothly into my laser printer and emerge the same way. No jamming, no smearing.*The TrueBlock (TM) Technology works well. This allows you to reuse manila envelopes and boxes without looking so much like you're recycling them...as long as the original label isn't larger than 2 inches by four inches. (A fairly generous size for a single address; small to include address of origin alongside the address of destination.) They retain a professional, clean appearance.*The bright white of the templates contrasts beautifully with dark print, keeping visibility clear. Again, professional and clean.*In addition, Avery will give you support as you use them. On the back of each sheet they've printed (in two languages) tips for use and directions for where to go on the web to get templates for Microsoft Word on the web or through e-mail. (Not sure why they need my name and e-mail address for me to download these templates, but they promise not to Spam me. I'm trusting that it's because it gives them the opportunity to ask me to opt-in to e-mails...the default. I opted out.) In addition to the blank template for mailing labels (be sure you enter the product number, 5263, to easily access the right ones!), there are specialized templates for use particularly with color printers. Current themes include holidays, seasons, special events (birth, wedding, graduation), patriotic and a host of various business ideas (dental, salon, etc.) They currently have 57 downloads available in support of this one product.All in all, a good solid product with really exceptional support from an industry leader.

For me this has made making great labels more user friendly because I always found the templates in word to be a bit clunky and limiting. The only thing I dislike is that many of the designs available look a bit dated and heavy on clip art.

These labels have a dark underside (TrueBlock) which successfully masks what's underneath, making them perfect for covering a previous label on a box. My box store brand labels are more translucent, something I accepted without thought until I tried these labels.

But only these Avery labels are completely opaque.For users of Microsoft Word, you can use the Label Wizard to set up printing, or you can go to the company's web site to download the label templates.The only thing that I didn't like about these labels is their flimsy backing sheet, which doesn't affect the labels themselves but which makes it more difficult to line up the sheets in my printer. Every so often, I'll print one that is slightly crooked because the sheet didn't get held properly in place by the manual feed slots.

Most Avery labels can stick to a wide variety of materials ranging from paper to pained surfaces to plastic and these are no exception.As advertised, they are very opaque and anything underneath will generally not show through. If you hold the label up to the light, you might be able to make out what was underneath--but otherwise you can't see through it.They feed through printers without issue (even color lasers that may snake the labels through several rollers) and peel of cleanly.Do you need Avery labels for everything?

However, these are only 2x4 - trying to fit the return address as well as an address was a bit too snug for my liking.Still, I had a mass-mailing that needed to be done, so I used these labels. I enlarged the typeface and used them strictly for addressee information, afixing a smaller return address label to the top left corner of a large envelope. Instead of looking liking tiny labels on a big envelope, these labels were sizable enough to dominate the envelope well enough to stand out and be noticed - particularly important for mailing purposes.It's always good to find other uses for labels - these were just large enough to fit another purpose very well. I have a massive library of books and those that are favorites merit a nameplate. I used clipart and created bookplates. Turned on end, they fit particularly well inside the front of books without being overly large. The labels are thick and solid enough to work without looking flimsy.

They peel cleanly and stick well.The thing that really pushes Avery labels into the 5 star category for me is the [...] templates website. A full-featured online layout tool supports most Avery labels, has tons of font/typeface combinations, supports useful things like filling in the rest of your labels based on a variation of the previous one, does mail-merge, etc, etc. AND that doesn't require any download-- when you're done, it generates a PDF to print. Definitely a big win in the increasingly online-centric application world. There are downloads for MS Office and other tools available on the site, also.These labels are big, nearly double the size of what I picture as letter sized envelope labels, so unless your fonts are massive, there's plenty of room on the label to add a graphic, or logo, or whatever.

What is particularly nice about these labels is they are fully blocking of any printing underneath. Furthermore, one can print only the labels one needs and reuse the label page provided one prints and removes from the bottom up. Of course, one needs to use the pattern and keep track of where to start. These labels are easy to remove from the backing and attach firmly to the envelope or box.To use these in an ink jet printer, select plain paper but request high resolution printing (700 dpi or higher).
