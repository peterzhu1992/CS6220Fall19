I originally purchased the oil for the cutters directly from Fellowes a couple of years ago; the bottle was smaller and more expensive at the time. I was quite pleased to find this product available from Amazon at a good price and larger bottle.I think a lot of people buy a shredder, not knowing that it does need some maintenance to keep it in top shape. Besides not overloading your shredder's capabilities or shredding material that you shouldn't, the next best thing you can do to protect your investment is to regularly lubricate the cutters. This reduces wear, noise, and can prevent the teeth from breaking.Be sure to read the instructions for your particular shredder, however, about the type of oil to use and the frequency. You may be tempted to use other types of oil you already have around your house or WD-40 or something, but many of those things are flammable and will only serve to damage your shredder or worse.As another reviewer said, be careful when cutting the tip on the bottle because if you make it too big, the oil will be harder to control.",5,Great Protection for Your Shredder Investment,1184976000,"07 21, 2007",0.0561

World Traveler,"[3, 13]","I gave it 2 stars because it does not have a warning label.I had purchased this at another store and when I first used it I cut too much off the nozzle and spilled some on a trash bag. My cat started licking at it and had to take her to the vet because the bottle does not have any warning stickers. It turns out that the product is mostly vegetable oil and the worse that I would have to watch for is diarrhea in my cat.The product works really well but it is a danger to pets because of the oil's sweet scent. I'm only buying it again because it works great, is the same price as they other store, and because I now have my shredder protected from my cat. I strongly advise anyone who uses this product to keep their shredder covered if they have pets or something that may be attracted to the oil. Especially if it has an automatic turn on to protect your pet if they put their tongue in your shredder.Update** I was really upset when I tried writing this review.

When I bought a replacement shredder I began applying shredder oil every month and I can really tell the difference. The shredder is three years old now and operates as well as new. The motor sounds even it chews through the papers very well.The bottle is easy to open and a long extension nozzle is helpful for precise place-ment of the drops. Each application requires only a small amount of oil. I would say I put a total of 8 drops in the opening, and then move the blades in both directions. This takes a total of many 20 seconds.I read that once this oil runs out it can be replaced by vegetable oil and I will try that, however this is not going to happen any time soon as I use very little during each application, so this bottle is going to last a very long time.I noticed that the price on the on this product fluctuates. There is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called Online Price Alert. This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on online price alert in Google it will be come up at the top.

As it turns out, my shredder can be lubed with simple cooking oil; my bad.Knowing what I now know, I believe the product is somewhat overpriced. But the reason I gave this product 3 stars & not five is both the container design and the way it is presented in the product description. There is nothing that I would call an extension nozzle. There is a nozzle (exactly what you see in the product photo). To me, an extension nozzle is something that attaches to the regular nozzle and lets you dispense the product in a controlled manner.With this product lets the oil (which is very light in weight) pour rather than drizzle out of the nozzle (note: the word extension not used). My shredder said to drizzle some oil on a piece of paper yada, yada yada. I cut the nozzle on this container at the marked cut line, but the oil poured out so quickly that it saturated & puddled on 2/3 of the sheet before I could stop.I have a real extension from one of my gun cleaning kits that fits this nozzle, and I will be using that henceforth.

13,A2GPLOLLE6BUDT,B00006I58N,Dave,"[0, 3]","There was at least one reviewer who had indicated the price of this lubricant was reasonable. I am not sure he calculated its cost which is roughly $87.00 per gallon. At that price it may be cheaper to never lubricate your shredder and just replace it when it wears out. I am not advocating that you should not lubricate your shredder, but just plain motor oil will be nearly as good and a lot cheaper considering that you can lubricate many items in your home by using an inexpensive oil can filled with inexpensive motor oil. Some may want to use a light grade in one can and a heavier grade in another, but you can save yourself a lot of money over the years by not buying special purpose lubricants when they are not really needed. Of course you would want to use higher priced synthetic oils like Mobil One in your Ferarri or Mercedes that is required for their warranty, but even that standard for high performance engines is still more than 10 times cheaper than this Shredder Oil. Decisions on the use of certain types of oil are not going to make or break you, I am just suggesting putting such small decisions into perspective. Its similar to the example of the guy who buys a new car every two years and trades his old one in, but he will change his engine oil every 3,000 miles because that's what his father told him to do. The only reason for changing the oil so often is if you are selling your car to your father who will keep it for years.In conclusion, if it makes you feel better using the special $87.00 per gallon shredder oil I think you should do so. But you may want to acknowledge that at least some of your decision is based upon how you feel as opposed to how you think.",2,The current price of crude oil cannot justify this price!,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",0.2021

54,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B00006I58N,Scott FS,"[1, 1]","Shredders need lubrication! I found out the hard way when our Fellows shredder started acting up (not running items through, stopping, reversing, et cetera). I always thought it was a bit of bunk, needing to lubricate shredders, but it's true, they do need it.When you think about it, paper is drying. It absorbs oil, water, etc, so when you run it through the shredder, it's going to eventually suck up any lubrication on the cutting wheels.You can use vegetable oils, but that is so messy. This product comes in a large bottle (suitable for an office environment) with a spout that can be cut so that just the right amount comes out. And it works great, just running a small bead on the wheels.The shredder, which was balky before, now works as God and Fellows intended. Fellows makes a superior shredder, and their oil keeps the machine in good shape.This is a keeper and is highly recommended! Shredders are a must these days, and good ones are expensive.

It came with a small bottle of oil that actually lasted me quite a while. But, when I was ready, I ordered this large bottle of oil and keep it in the compartment on the back of my shredder, so that it is always right there for when it is time to empty the basket and oil again.As I mentioned, this is a LOT of oil and will last a very, very long time for home use and quite a while for office use as well. It comes in a nice, sturdy bottle with a little stopper top that stays on perfectly fine as long as you aren't tossing the bottle around. I like the shape of the bottle because it fits perfectly in the compartment on the back of my shredder. If I wasn't able to keep it right there with my shredder I would probably forget to use it.I purchased this eleven months ago and my bottle is still almost full. For six-seven dollars, it is a good deal IMO. Maybe you could just buy a bottle of some other kind of oil, but I think it is worth those few dollars to have a bottle with the thin tip for easy application and I don't have to remember to run to the kitchen to get some oil, pour it into something that makes it easier to apply, and then have another dish to wash.
