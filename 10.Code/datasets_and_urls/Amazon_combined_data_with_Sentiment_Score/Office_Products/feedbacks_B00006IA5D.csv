2,AROQO2VDODT7,B00006IA5D,"[1, 1]","I use this item daily, and it works perfectly. It doesn't slide around in the drawer, and the buckets are easy enough to get items in to and out of. I would purchase this item again, if the need arose.",5,Perfect,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",Branden,0.3591

5,AKLUFVL8A311U,B00006IA5D,"[0, 0]","This works perfect for my needs. I put it in a drawer of a Safco Mesh File cart and it pretty well fills it. I didn't want a tray with tiny little compartments for few paper clips and other stuff that usually doesn't fit them. The bins in this tray are large and deep enough to store larger items.Good buy, it is heavy and strongly built. I would recommend it.",5,GOOD LARGE BINS - sturdy build,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",John Bean beaner,0.3059
6,A14O0BENBHDUN9,B00006IA5D,"[0, 0]","I finally made the plunge and got a drawer organizer for our bathroom drawer. My husband and I have a single drawer in our bathroom so it's always quite messy filled with toothpaste, hairbrushes, hair ties, floss, bandaids, and more.This Drawer Organizer does the trick! There is a good variety of compartments that fit all of our items perfectly and I LOVE how deep this organizer is. One of the small compartments holds all of my bobbypins and hair ties perfectly. The longer organizer holds my hairbrush and combs while the middle organizer we keep for toothpaste.",5,Perfect for our bathroom!,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",Maradanger,0.2135

It fits as expected. I really like the deep pocketed sections.I purchased two. One for my desk at work, the other for my junk drawer at home. Fits my needs.",5,Super pleased - great product,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",Ohioan,0.1474
