6,A39ALS60U21HE5,B00006BB7Y,Katherine Rose,"[0, 0]","I bought this gel mouse pad to replace my previous Belkin Gel Mouse pad that finally gave out after 10 years of service.My old one lasted 10 years, at which point it got a whole on the wrist-rest and that was the beginning of the end for it. The wrist-rest on this particular mouse pad is high enough that my hand is at a comfortable position. I got the blue one, which is like a pantone blue. Very nice.",4,"Four stars because well, it's a mousepad",1396396800,"04 2, 2014",0.3986
