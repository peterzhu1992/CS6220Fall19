0,AWKZAUC0D8DYL,B00006B8GI,Auskan Auskan,"[1, 1]","If you like professional and uniform looking labels - and I do - then this is a great product. I have a P-Touch label maker that I have used forever to create labels for my file folders. Rather than hand-writing, I print the label, then peel the adhesive strip to the file folder and I do like that my labels have a uniform look. What detracts from this system is that my labels are printed on white, so once adhered to the file folder, the label as well as the text is clearly visible. What sets the Avery labels apart is that the label itself is clear. Thus, it is virtually invisible once it is adhered. This adds a very professional look to the labels, in addition to the uniform look.However the reason I said in the title that they are best for business use? The label sheets can be run through your printer which will print the whole page at once. Prior to their arrival I didn't think this would be a problem, as I could just print a few, then save the sheet and next time I needed labels, print a few more. Nuh-uh. The sheet can ONLY be run through the printer one time, due to the adhesive residue on the page that will gum up the printer. This means I need to know ahead of time what labels I will need for all 50 labels! Now granted, if I were starting a new project of some kind, that wouldn't be a problem. But generally I need to create only a few labels at a time - and I don't want to wait months until I have 50 labels that need printed! For this reason, I downgraded my rating to a 4.The software templates available online make it easy to create the labels. You can even add a graphic, such as a logo, to the label. When I saw the suggestion that you can print a label for both sides of the divider at once, I could not at first see how this would be useful. However I now realize how handy it is to have both sides of the divider labeled. Now, no matter where I am in the binder, I can easily flip to the section I need. (This feature means I only have to wait until I need to print 25 labels, instead of 50, before printing the whole sheet. It also means I go through twice as many labels.)Another nice feature is that rather than having to peel and stick individual labels, it is easy to label a whole strip of five at once. You simply line them up, stick down the labels, then when you remove the outer strip, all that is left is the labels on the dividers.The dividers themselves are flimsier than I would prefer. Thicker than paper but not as rigid as a good cardstock. The corners are sharp rather than rounded. So far this hasn't been a problem, although I can see them getting turned over and creased more easily. The hole side is reinforced and so far has held up well.Overall this is a good product but I do believe its best application is in a business setting where multiple labels are frequently required.",4,Great office product - not so good for personal use,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",0.3129

(I accessed it quickly by searching Woord 2007's online Help.) Click DOWNLOAD, accept terms, follow prompts and such, then you will be prompted to enable macros in Word. Once that process is complete (a few mins), you're all set to start creating. (You'll want to adjust the SAVE AS option, make sure you save it in your Docs, or wherever you keep templates, otherwise it goes into a preset MS folder and you may never find it again!)It's very user friendly. This is not your most basic Avery label, where you insert directly onto the template. Rather, you insert text and photos from a separate on-screen window. You can add different pictures on each tab (left or right position, easy Browse and Insert from Your Pictures) or the same pic on all tabs. Same with text. Click OK to view template, and if you need to edit, click EDIT TEXT OR PICTURES on the toolbar and the screen returns. Changes are made quickly enough, with a visible progress bar. Fonts can be easily tested out and edited - ctrl+a to select all on the actual template, then scroll through several preset fonts to see the changes before your eyes without final editing, then click the one you like best to make the changes final. You can also access and use MSWord's full set of installed fonts by clicking Create New Theme Fonts and saving as Custom.The template automatically prints in BLACK, size 14. What I have not found is how to quickly change the entire page's font COLORS and SIZES. The only way that has worked for me is to select the text on each individual label and then apply a new color or size from Word HOME (off the Avery template toolbar, back onto the Word toolbar). I have tried several tricks, nothing has worked. This is unfortunate, as color coding can be an extremely helpful and effective way to access specific tabbed sections of information.The template screen gives you the option to start on any row you choose, which is a great way to conserve template sheets, since you may not use every label on the sheet every time. You can print more than one set at a time and then Collate or Group.Overall I really like these, and I will forgive the color and size faux pas for now.

On Avery's web site they have their Consumer Service Center shown as Brea, California. I called the number listed (1-800-462-8379) and was given several choices of support. There is an option for templates and software, products, and all other issues. Any of the options you choose whether you're calling from the US or Canada will route you to their call center in Manilla, Philippines.

It took some time to download and install, but well worth the time. The wizard was easy to use. I was able to use a big text size and printed the row of 5-tab labels quickly and easy.Once I had my labels printed out, I was able to lay down the row of tab sheets (you can not do this if the tabs are already in the notebook), align, rub-down into place, and then peel away the outside edging. If you have a lot of tabs to make at once this product would be very helpful. You get 10 sets of 5-tab rows per sheet.On the other hand, I still like using the Avery 612797 tabs which has 80 tabs per sheet and better for times when you just need to print a couple tabs.",1,"Like the product, but don't like Avery business practices.",1292889600,"12 21, 2010",0.2412
9,AV3XTMK5I2AWI,B00006B8GI,Canthespam,"[1, 2]","Let me say this right off the bat... I have NEVER written a review for a product that I haven't used personally, but in this case I have made an exception.I wrongly assumed when I requested these labels and dividers, that I could print out as many or as few labels as my project required. Read the instructions carefully - you can only run the one included sheet of 50, through your printer ONCE, and if the number that you need is less than 50, you cannot use the sheet again and have to buy either another package with dividers or individual packages of label sheets - either 10 sheets of 80 labels each, or 25 sheets of 80 labels. The reason they can't be used in the printer again is that the exposed, residual adhesive might ruin your printer.I contacted Avery's customer service (not mentioning Amazon or Vine) and was given the extra label purchase information above.Only one sheet of 50 labels comes with this package of 25 dividers. You can print labels to be used on both sides of the index tabs. Unless you have a large project, where you will be using all 50 labels, the others will have to be written on with a pen, which is all right if you don't want the uniformity of all of the labels being printed and not hand written. It is not a huge expense, but it would then require you to buy additional packages of 800 or 2,000 labels, again using the exact number that you require for your project, and throwing away the remainder of the sheet.Judging by the pictures only and the info on Avery's web site, professional results appear to be easily achieved with the printed labels. I have a project that only requires 15 labels and to be truthful, I will wait until I have a larger project, so I can print and use all 50 labels at the same time.For the $20.00 cost, I think that they should include more label sheets, varying the number of labels on each sheet. Maybe several sheets of 10 to 20.The package as it comes, and the purchase of subsequent packages of sheets, appears to be for industrial sized jobs, assembly-line production of multiple reports, or for companies/individuals who don't mind not having to write in headings on left over unprintable labels.As for the binder that was included in the Amazon/Vine package, it appears to be a good buy.

This Avery product saves me time in that it allows me to label all my tabs at once using the enclosed label strip (which has guides on it to allow proper placement on the tabs). The design is a time saver and the guides work well.The drawback to this is that Avery's instructions tell you to only feed the label sheet once through your printer, so, with 5 sets of 5 tabs each, you really need to have a bigger project/multiple packets to optimally use these labels.Avery also includes a label sheet for sticking individual labels one at a time onto the tabs (but again, the assumption is that the label sheet is to be feed through the printer as a one time only sheet).The Avery website is easy to navigate and the Avery templates are easy to use.This is a great product for my use.

When you go to the next screen on the five column template and view details, the numbers 11436 will show up.Usually things have disclaimers about how they won't work on Macs (it either won't line up, won't open the pdf, or requires a rocket scientist). This product did not say there would be a Mac problem until AFTER you download the template. Then and only then does it clearly state that there will be a problem with Word 2008 and Macs. Since my computer's default always ignores Word 2008 and goes back to an earlier version, I thought it would be fine. LOL! Not quite. Generally, I don't click agree on anything that says trust all documents from this publisher. Compile error in hidden module: blah blah blah was my second alert. The next problem was that the template had a box of text over it and that led to my second compile error in hidden module. I was able to get rid of the box by first deleting the text and then selecting the box and cutting it. It is hardly ever easy to use things with Macs but generally Avery has been compatible so I was surprised by this.

But I went to the main Amazon site to check the selling and full retail prices first, and noticed something that changes my review considerably. Make no mistake - this is a VERY nice product, as detailed below. BUT: What Amazon Vine program reviewers received for review is NOT what you will get when purchasing the same product. What you will get is an excellent quality set of divider pages (fairly heavy card stock with plastic reinforcement along the 3-ring punched edge) and clear labels for the divider tabs. Sounds very basic at first. What sets this apart is that the clear (not white) labels are constructed in such a way on the full 8x11 sheet that you simply lay a strip of 5 labels across 5 divider pages, line up the labels, and apply them all at the same time. They line up perfectly with the divider tabs, leaving you with a professional looking presentation or project. If you want a first class presentation or project, this is definitely the way to go.The problem is that Avery sent Amazon Vine reviewers the same product with a very nice Avery 1 D-ring notebook included. You won't get that with your purchase. So the price you'll pay - even at the discounted Amazon rate - makes these labels pretty expensive even with the Amazon discount off regular retail. You'll still have to go purchase a separate notebook. I don't know if Avery was using that as a subtle way to increase ratings on the product since it would not be obvious to an Amazon Vine reviewer that what we're reviewing is not what you'll be getting. I just think comparing apples with apples, so to speak, is the most appropriate and fair way to do it, and what we reviewed is more than what the retail customer gets through Amazon. I called Avery to verify, before writing this review, since I thought (hoped) perhaps the Amazon description simply forgot to mention the included notebook - it didn't because there is no notebook with the labels and dividers when you purchase it on Amazon.With all that said, if I was rating ONLY what the Amazon customer will purchase on line, I'd increase the rating to a solid 4-star rating - perhaps a bit over-priced, but WELL worth the money if you want a first class, professional looking presentation or project. You'd have a very hard time creating the perfectly aligned effect with individually applied labels.

For projects that don't require that level of finish, they are really too expensive to use on a day-to-day basis, especially since there are so many labels on the page.

Next, figuring out which way it goes in the printer. Thanks to the handy practice sheet I got it in a couple of tries. Wouldn't it be great if you could put in your printer make and model and it would tell you which way the paper goes. One of the slickest features of Clear Label is being able to apply labels to all five tabs at once. After lining up the tabs and the strip, you can apply them all at once but to remove the remainder of the strip requires a little fiddling with each label... at least they all got positioned perfectly and that's the important point. Maybe they could make them break apart just a little easier.Where you need to follow my directions instead of theirs is if you are applying labels to both sides of each tab. Unlike the example Avery supplies, you don't want to just type the labels two up. For the second set, you'll want to reverse the order. Otherwise you won't be able to take advantage of the Easy Apply Label Strip and you'll be back to peeling them off one by one and hoping you can line them up. I didn't figure this out on the first batch but it worked well on the second.The end result is a very nice looking set of tabs and knowing they are made from 30% recycled paper helps too... especially when I read today that global climate change has already killed off 40% of the phytoplankton in the Earth's oceans and I happen to know that historically, half of the world's oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis.

It is my understanding that the binder is not a part of the package, so I will not describe the binder.**The first thing I did after opening the package was make two copies of the Easy Apply Practice Sheet because I wanted to test print directly from the template and not print on a plain piece of paper and hold it against the practice sheet as recommended. I wanted to see it directly on the form. Because the label sheet can go through a printer only 1 time, be sure you have enough ink in your printer, especially if you're printing in color. Would be rotten luck to run out of ink halfway through the job. Now 50 labels may seem like a lot, but if you're printing for an office or conference, that's a drop in the bucket. If you're looking to print a row or two, this is not the best product for you. This is suitable for larger projects which require repetitive applications and can save over the cost of having dividers professionally printed. What makes this product different is that you print a sheet of labels, remove a strip then apply the labels onto 5 tabs with one movement. You can reverse the process for labels on the reverse of each tab, hence the 50 labels on a sheet for 25 tabs. The instructions on the back of the sheet direct the user to move from left to right in peeling, pressing and removing the strip, but I see no reason it can't be done from right to left because the margins are the same on both ends. I became a little nervous when reading the instructions and saw, professional-lookin g dividers, not a very professional look with the error in spelling. Made me question all aspects of the product since there was an error in Avery's professional printing. Anyway, I was impressed by the Avery website and template options available, and I also enjoyed playing around with the Design Pro offered from the website, especially for a Mac computer. I designed my labels in color, ran a couple of tests, making the necessary adjustments in design and alignment, printed the labels with baited breath, and enjoyed the application process which was very fast and efficient. The sheets are very white and crisp, have nice sharp corners, and the rounded tabs are nested together beautifully with no empty space between them.

I'm very pleased with these labels, however.One thing to be aware of: the product cover which notes that the guarantee extends only to a sheet of labels that has been fed through a printer a single time. Initially I'd planned to use these labels and dividers for my son's school binder, which contains only 5 subjects, but since each sheet of label strips contains 25 labels (5 rows of 5) and can only be run through the one time, it would have been a waste.For personal use, I can't think of other similarly large projects for which I'd need 25 labels at a time. I imagine these would be wonderful in an office, though, or perhaps come tax season when it's time to organize receipts?I wound up using this to label my large, hyper-organized recipe binder and the results look stunning!

Each page also has a thin plastic reinforcer strip along the hole-punched side, and similar clear-plastic reinforcement on both sides of each tab. The corners of the pages are sharp, not rounded.

This was affordable, but it looked cheap and cheesy and I searched high and low for a better option.

If you can fill out a form, you have all the skills necessary to make custom tabs.

Every company I've worked for in the past fifteen years imposes strict sanctions against installing software yourself, and waiting for IT to approve and install it takes a long time.

As well, the labels all go on straighter and more professionally. Nice innovation!It is also nice that enough labels are included with the dividers to put the labels on the front and the back of the dividers. **It's important to note though, that if putting the labels on the front and the back, the ones for the back need to be printed in the backwards order than the ones for the front.** They do not illustrate this on their materials, and if it was in the instructions, I didn't see it! This is important because there aren't extras and if it's done without that switch, the backs will have to be hand applied, negating the time savings!These labels are really best for those doing all 5 sets in the package at the same time, because making multiple runs though a printer with the same label sheet can be unreliable. Also, setting it up multiple times negates much of the time savings as well.The package also comes with standard tab labels that can be applied singly.

52,AACGHYIQZWVIL,B00006B8GI,S. Hamon Super Mom,"[1, 1]","Oh my Avery, how I LOVE you!! I am a total neat freak and obsessed with file organization within my home as well as at the office. I use other Avery label products to label my hanging folders, which this product isn't really good for because those have the little tabs that get shoved into the plastic clip. I also have subfolders within my hanging folders (your basic 3-tab folder), and again, these labels aren't good for those either because those folders have a much wider labelling area. So, minus a star for not being able to use these economically with other folders. Of course, if you wanted to use these on your basic 3-tab folder, you could...but the label itself is not very long and you wouldn't be utilizing the wider space on the 3-tab folders tab...plus these cost too much to do that. These are designed for 5-tab folder systems.Ok, now that I got my gripes out of the way...on to the good stuff! Avery states you should go to their website and download the template (11436) to print these bad boys correctly. I did not need to do that as both of my word processing software packages already had the template and it worked perfectly (I have Microsoft Word 2007 and OpenOffice.org). Something I am a bit confused about, my package of trial labels came with 2 different label sheets that utilize 2 separate templates. The first one is the one you see in the product image (11436), the one that makes applying 5 labels at a time a breeze (sheet contains 50 labels)....the second one looks more like your typical label sheet (template 612797) and contains 80 labels divided into 4 columns of 20. Again, both Word and OpenOffice had this 2nd template and printed perfectly! (note template 612797 is exact same as Avery Template 5836)Others have complained stating they were unable to put the label through their printer for 2nd or even 3rd times making these a one-time-use sheet. I did experience problems putting the label through a 2nd time on my inkjet printer, but no problems at all on my laser printer. This I can't explain, but it is good news for me because now I don't have to print all 50 labels at one time or throw away the sheet if I only did print a few.No other reviews that I have read have stated how much text can be placed on the label. This I find important, so hopefully me telling you helps. Using your standard Times New Roman font, size 12, you can fit 23 characters across and on 2 lines....so 46 characters total. This of course changes if you adjust the font type and size, or if you put an image on the label (yes, you can do that and it is awesome!!).These also come with a 2 3-ring binder that has the vinyl overwrap on the exterior to insert a page on the front or back (I received a black one, but who knows if that is standard, or if colors are random). The interior has 3 built-in pockets on the front & back (so 6 total) that are stacked evenly adding to the organizational appearance. The binder has a rubber pull-tab to open/close the binder rings, which are D-shaped making turning pages and storing the binder closed less stressful on the holes of the paper in the binder.To start filling up that fancy binder and have a place to stick the labels, Avery includes a set of 25 3-hole-punched dividers. These are white and have a reinforced plastic stripping over the label tab as well as along the side where the holes are punched (preventing them from being torn out of the binder or wearing out prematurely). The dividers are thicker than your standard paper, but no where near the quality of say cardstock. Shame on you Avery for creating such a wonderful label process with crappy quality dividers.If I haven't said enough already, let me say some more things. I personally love these labels, but can see where others wouldn't. You need to have a need for these labels or they will be a waste of your time & money. My co-workers laugh at me when I'm on another labelling mission, but when it comes time that they need a document and they can't find it in their poorly organized desks...who do you think they come to?",4,Another wonderful Avery product that feeds my OCD....,1287619200,"10 21, 2010",0.1157

I am going to make a family journal and this is perfect to start with my pages, then go to my grandparents on my Father's side, then my Mothers side and on to Great Grandparents. The 5 tabs per set will give me just what I'm going to need to work my Family Journal up! How easy can this be to accomplish what has been nagging at me for so long not quite knowing how to put it together. I will be able to use pictures with the journaling as well! Avery has made this possible for me to now know how to do my Family Journal and also to easily put each of my children and grandchildren one together. I went onto Avery's site to look at the labels I can get by just downloading to Microsoft Word or to Adobe Reader. Thank you Amazon Vine!",5,Binder for many uses!,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",0.2792

I have to admit to being a little intimidated with trying to affix five labels simultaneously, but it's a lot easier than it looks. To help keep the dividers from shifting when applying the labels, I placed them in a three-ring binder.Even though I only have a simple inkjet printer, the labels ended up looking professionally printed and don't smear, which seems surprising on something transparent.There's a drawback, though, in that the label sheets are only supposed to, based on the manufacturer's directions, be fed through the printer once. This means printing 50 labels out. This is reasonable for office use, but for general home project/home office use, one-copy reports, and the like, it's too many. For example, I was printing labels and only needed 10 labels total for the two separate projects I was working on.While it's a great product, you ideally need to either have large projects to use the labels for, or plan ahead for printing out labels for multiple projects at once.",5,Useful product best for larger projects,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",0.4179

Included are 5 sets of 5, with one set of traditional labels, one set of easy labels, and one practice sheet. Templates are downloadable from Avery.The easy-tabs ensure that the divider labels align, which is a nice touch. I'm going to see if I can pick these up in colored labels -- that would be sweet and perfect for how I use this product (essentially a career portfolio).",4,Great divider set with labels,1278806400,"07 11, 2010",0.5846

57,A3M7R4PD0FEPUB,B00006B8GI,T. K. Paul imatyak,"[0, 0]","Not only did I use these for notebook dividers, I used them to label file folders. They fit and look great with some minor adjustments (putting one folder inside another). One of the nicest aspects of using these for dividers is the straight placement. I think they look much nicer than anything I've used before. I have several notebooks that have over 25 dividers, so the time I saved creating and applying the labels is very much appreciated. I also took advantage of the fact that I could play around with section titles to see which would fit best.Avery labels are about all I can get either at my local Staples and Wal-Mart stores. (I don't even know who else makes them anymore.) I'll be buying these again.",4,They look very nice,1282521600,"08 23, 2010",0.4202
58,A22I55P15NSAOX,B00006B8GI,Two kids mom scienceteachermom,"[0, 0]","First of all, unless you are in Vine, you DO NOT receive a binder with these dividers. So disregard any comments about a binder in reviews when considering ordering this product.Printing them was simple as was applying them in the strips of 5 makes quick and easy work of getting the dividers ready. The ink from my Canon inkjet did not smear at all.These dividers are great for large projects that you want to look professional. However, the biggest drawback is that you must print all 50 of the clear labels at once. This is fine if you have multiple presentations but makes it difficult to for smaller projects unless you want to write on the tabs, which defeats the purpose of getting printable tabs. In short, this product is fantastic for making up presentation binders for a business, but will not be useful for setting up binders for your kids for school (since they are unlikely to need 50 dividers at once). I would not use them for my own home use, but will buy more for my business.I gave this 4 stars in relation to using it for larger projects.",4,"Great for big projects, too much waste for smaller ones.",1281484800,"08 11, 2010",0.106

How many times have I done that in my many, many binders. Not anymore. The index maker labels are a nice construction.
