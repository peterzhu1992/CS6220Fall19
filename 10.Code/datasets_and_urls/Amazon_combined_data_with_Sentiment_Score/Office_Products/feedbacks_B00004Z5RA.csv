6,A3UW23DBF2KHWC,B00004Z5RA,"[1, 1]","Belkin Wrist Pad is a great support for all people who spend lot of time working with their keyboards that will help your wrists and hands don't get tired so much.It's lightweight, very comfortable, ergonomic product and it's made asymmetrical that is great for me because position of hands during keyboard use isn't the same.The pad is filled with gel making it adjustable to your own hands thus providing great support.I like keyboard wrist pads that aren't combined with mouse pads because that allows user to combine position of keyboards and mouse in a way that is convenient to the user, but also making it suitable for both left-handers and right-handers.Since I use it for a month I cannot yet speak about its durability though it's looking like a lasting product that doesn't wear a lot during use.Overall, this Belkin Wrist Pad would be my first recommendation if you are searching for good wrists support being in front of the computer for a whole day.",5,"Lightweight, very comfortable, ergonomic making it my first choice for wrist pad...",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",Denis Vukosav,0.9743

8,A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,B00004Z5RA,"[1, 1]","My wife was having soreness in her wrists that may have signaled the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome. I ordered the Belkin Wave Rest wrist pad, and since she started using it, the soreness has subsided. She loves the pad. It's about an inch wider than the keyboard she's using, so she doesn't have to move her hands off the pad. I've used it a few times, and I liked it enough that I may get one for myself.I think the wrist pad is worth trying for anyone who may be developing carpal tunnel syndrome or any related problem.",5,Wrist pain subsided after using the pad for a few days,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",J.

However if you look at the picture closely, the pad is actually a bit thinner 4/3rd of the way to the left, I think the designer's ideal is to make the thickest part near the number pad on the right side..But the problem is that number pad is least used part of the keyboard, and when my hand rest on &#34;F&#34; and &#34;J&#34; key the right side gets a lot less coverage than the left side, and feel very unbalanced.",3,"Great, small quirks",1391472000,"02 4, 2014",Li Amazon-Aholic,0.5906
