1,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B00004Z5SM,Ali Julia,"[1, 1]","I've been using Avery labels for my label needs for many years. The best thing about Avery labels that they stick on very well, smoothly, without puckers. I use the lables also with the colored ink jet printer and black and white laser printer. The paper quality is good and there is no blurring of ink when used with ink jet printers. Laser printer results are excellent as well.I usually do need to print a huge number of labels and can't fill the entire sheet. However I found that I can reliably print the labels on the sheet in two several passes, even when some labels were alredy peeled off. o avoid labels sicking to the printer I flip the sheet and have the part that has no peeled labels go first. This really helps me to save money and only print what I need without waste.Avery redesigned the label sheet to reduce wasted paper. Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels. Despite less of a hold on the labels I am still able to feed the paper through twice as described above.There is a large variety of free templates for use with Avery labels, all you need to know is the number of the label to get the right template. Using templates I get perfect results with several different word processors - no waste, all labels get printered and perfectly aligned.You can't go wrong with Avery labels.Ali Julia review",5,You can't go wrong with Avery labels!,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",0.2791
2,A278LEQK1TEPVB,B00004Z5SM,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Rarely does a company claim something is improved that actually is better, but this is one of those rare occasions. The simple lack of paper in between the columns of labels does wonders for the ease of peeling off a label. Why this isn't a common practice for all printable stickers is the real question. No more bending the paper to peel one off. On my inkjet printer the printed labels look wonderful as far as colors and clarity. With the template I was able to customize several mailing labels for different seasons and different addresses. The labels affix to envelopes easily and I haven't noticed any peeling. I have only used the labels on regular envelopes, so I don't know how they would hold up on any other type of packaging (such as padded envelopes), but will update if I ever find out. The labels could have been a little longer to allow for a longer address in larger fonts or a small picture/clip art, but I still was able to put a small jack-o-lantern in front of my friend's address when sending her a Halloween card (only really sent her one so I could use more labels just for fun). I just had to use a smaller font next to the clip art, but it still is a good size.Word of caution: Depending on your printer, the printing may be off center or higher on the label than expected. I'm almost positive this is my printer because I have had this issue with mailing seals as well, but just wanted to advise others to check this before printing many labels.",5,"Easy to Peel, Good Quality",1287014400,"10 14, 2010",0.2725

But, these labels are easy to use with MS Word templates. But unless you are going to have a printer that serves only as a label printer, if you have only one or two labels to print, you will save time by writing them by hand because there is some setup time. As long as you have names and addresses stored in Word, and do not have to take time to add new addresses for a particular mailing, I think three labels is the point where you start saving time by printing them on your printer.There is really nothing special about the labels, the adhesive is good and evenand the paper is bright white.

These slightly thicker labels are great, they feed through the printer without any problems (I'm using an HP D7360) and line up perfectly for my templates. With the normal style of Avery label I tend to pull off the outer grid, then raise each sticker one at a time - this can lead to wrinkled edges that don't stick as well. These new pop-up labels really do peel off easily and without edge damage but they don't come apart while printing. (I was afraid they would get stuck inside the printer - didn't happen). Definitely worth getting again and has a nice crisp appearance. I did see another reviewer had trouble with them sticking to poly bubble envelopes - with all my labels (except those on paper envelopes) I tend to cover them with a piece of clear tape, so I don't know if that is an issue or not. I did use them on that type of envelope, but with the tape applied as well.Updated 6/3/2012 - As these labels have aged they have developed some issues that make me reluctant to leave them with a 5 star rating. the adhesive has gotten less tacky, I now see more of the peeling the other reviewer reported. Equally annoying is a failure of my printer to recognize that these are printable. Because the easy peel has areas near the top that are not covered in label, my printer spits every fifth or sixth sheet out as unprintable. it can take a dozen re-feeds for the printer to stop thinking the page is upside down.

Why not just leave well enough alone and continue with the same style as they started off with so many years ago? Avery doesn't think that way, which is good for us.Avery redesigned the carrier sheet so peeling off the labels is simple as can be. It used to be that you had to bend the sheet to separate a label from the sheet and then slip a fingernail underneath it to peel it off. Now, Avery has eliminated the paper between the row of the labels and you just bend he carrier a bit and pull off the label. Simple, faster and less frustrating then it used to be.The labels are designed for ink jet printers and I had no trouble feeding them as single sheets.There was no spreading or blurring of colored inks.Avery has long offered design templates to make creating labels a lot easier. Way back when, printers and software were less sophisticated and you really had to know what you were doing to print labels without a lot of waste and hassle. Now just download the template, use it in a major word processing or other application that supports them and you're set to go.Avery still plays at the top of the label game and this particular style carries on that well deserved honor.Jerry",5,A good product keeps getting better.,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",0.256

The ink never smudged, and the labels came out perfectly clear. They are easy to peal off, and yet never peeled off when they weren't supposed to, even when I sent sheets through the printer with many of the labels already taken out. So, these are great labels, and I can't come up with a single complaint.Second, about the software: I have a Mac, so I didn't try the desktop software. However, on their website they have literally thousands of templates that will work with Microsoft office, and even Apple Pages. Much of it is a bit cheezy, but they have some very plain templates, and you can always edit out the pictures. This makes the labels extremely easy to use, as the templates avoid trial-and-error on placement and margins.All in all, a very nice label solution. One word of caution, however, and this is no fault of Avery and will happen with ANY inkjet product: the ink in inkjets is water soluble. That means if you use these for mail, you really should put transparent packing tape over the label. Probably not worth bothering to do this if you're making return labels, but mail does occasional get wet (neither rain nor sleet nor snow...) and a single drop of water can bleed an address printed on an inkjet.",5,"Work great, even with a Mac",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",0.2921

If you go to their website, they have four free options to generate labels, including mail merges, included graphics, font formatting, etc.:1) The old standard, Microsoft Word mail merges with templates. This is pretty much the same as I remembered - the 5160 template works perfectly, and I was able to do a test merge using my holiday list.2) An all online solution, Avery Design and Print Online. This is the standout for me. Cool, fully online, capable of using my data files, with clip art and good features. I like this a lot.

I've tried many styles and brands and Avery brand labels continue to be my favorites. Avery seems to have done everything right with their new Easy Peel labels. The paper is just the right thickness - blocks out any print underneath without creating a raised edge that gets caught easily. The glue doesn't lose adhesion over time. The paper is bright white with a smooth finish and the edges are cut smooth and clean. Perfect!Plus the new Easy Peel feature makes peeling off a label nearly effortless. The page is creased under the edge of the label sticker. Just bend the page and the edge of the label pops up for easy grabbing. Ingenious design!Number two runner up is 3M brand. Their paper has a slightly rougher face, but their glue is just as strong. No Easy Peel technology with 3M labels however.I've learned to stay away from Staples brand labels and the other generic brands. The glue is worthless and the paper is too thin to cover over any old print.So if you're looking for a great printer label and don't mind spending a little more for quality, Avery brand Easy Peel labels are the way to go.

Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use. CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs. For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000. There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labelswere a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name. The question was how to get the information printed on the labels. At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes. I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor laser printer labels, there were fourteen pre-made templates for the different size labels. I chose the template that matched my labels. Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint. I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text. A test run on my color laser printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels. The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up. I can never remember. After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success. Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours. We had enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs. One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways. The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before. I am now a big fan of Avery labels, but I recommend getting the free software to make them work.",5,Free Software Makes the Labels Work,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",0.2715

First, getting your ink jet to align with the labels is hard because there is no flexibility. A slight feed error and the printing overflows on the next label, and the whole set of 30 labels must be thrown out. Second, even when you get these lined up perfectly, the label is very small. You can get three lines only- squeezing four lines requires type that is too small, or lines that are too closely spaced. I gave this 4 stars because the labels are well made and work as advertised. I took one star off because the labels are too small, and I do not understand why they would suggest these are good for address labels- they are simply too small for most applications, and simply too small to line up properly on a printer. The templates are fine. But my epson printer grabs them with a slight shift each time.In all other aspects, these are excellent ink jet labels.
