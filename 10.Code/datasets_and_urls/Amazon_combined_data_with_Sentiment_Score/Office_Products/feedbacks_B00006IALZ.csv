1,A3RJZWLHXAPKTA,B00006IALZ,Jenny O.,"[0, 0]","I bought this for home use - these were piling up on my desk, so I wanted a place to put the mail and paperwork in my office while it waited around for me to get to it. This does the job. Is it elegant? I wouldn't go that far, but it looks better than a clear plastic inbox tray.",4,Does the job,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",0.3204

Well constructed, looks great, and effective. Non-slip feet help it say in place.",5,Excellent Tray,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",0.4929
3,A1P3DDFL423B3C,B00006IALZ,Mitch Haile,"[13, 13]","I have had two of these trays for a few years. I did at one point buy the (sold separately) spacers to stack them, but I've never been a fan of stacked trays and abandoned that idea. I keep these side-by-side on my desk, using them as a pair of In and Next boxes for David Allen's _Getting Things Done_ method of organizing tasks.These perfectly match my cherry desk--so much so that they look like a set. I have a bunch of the other desk accessories in this series (pencil cups, etc.) and they all look fantastic. Elegant without the overdone aluminum mesh. Sturdy, useful, and about the right price if you're on a budget without degrading into black plastic.Highly recommended.",5,Quite fantastic,1249344000,"08 4, 2009",0.2612

It fits 8 x 12 paper perfectly, and is able to accomodate her purses. The look is very classy",5,Very elegant looking,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",0.3765
