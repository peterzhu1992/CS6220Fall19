And, staples, while they have their place, just don't make it where a jumbo paper clip can clasp in its jumboness the sheaf of our thoughts or the checks of a bygone year. Paperclips are like paisleys. We all need more of them.",4,Trombones geants!,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",0.0722

8,A2ZRMCRLDSUX6R,B00006IBK8,Tom ontrac1,"[36, 43]","These are amazing! How clever that someone devised a way to bend thin strips of shiny metal in such a fashion that they can be used to clip several sheets of paper products together so they don't get lost. They don't work as well as my stapler, but those with commitment issues will find the paper clip a great alternative. They can also be bent into fun shapes when you are faced with idle time sitting at your desk. However, it seems that once they are altered from their original shape, they do not perform their intended task very well anymore. Sure glad that I purchased 1,000 of these little buggers.",4,Paper Clips,1291075200,"11 30, 2010",0.6376
