Quality is standard and has remained the same all the through the years. I added this to the order in order to qualify for the Super Saver Shipping. Nowadays I don't use this tape that much except for minor tasks. But I have some on hand just in case.,3,Scotch Tape,1379721600,"09 21, 2013",0.2496

2,A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B00005C3YY,C. Hill CFH,"[7, 10]","This Matte Finish Magic Tape is so much better than the generic types for most uses. It goes on totally clear on most paper, it is very strong, and the matte finish doesn't easily reflect light so it doesn't draw attention to itself.The brand name Scotch has become a proprietary eponym for this type of clear tape, along the same lines as Band-Aid, Kleenex, and Saran wrap for their respective products. This generally happens only when a product is the best of its kind and has become the de-facto standard. This is certainly the case for Scotch Tape.It may cost a little more, but it generally worth it. Highly Recommended!",5,Its Scotch Tape! Highly Recommended!,1252022400,"09 4, 2009",0.5975

It feels better, it doesn't yellow, it is very easy to wrap presents with, it is almost invisible, you can write on it, and probably thousands of other things.Does it cost a few cents more? Maybe, but it is the quality you are paying for. :)Plus, I am use use to saying &#34;can You tell me where the scotch tape is please&#34;?",5,Best tape the is,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",0.3652
4,AVDECPX9PL98P,B00005C3YY,Eddie Banuelos,"[0, 0]","This tape comes in handy when Christmas Day is only a few weeks away. It does the job in keeping gift wrapping intact, or even placing notes on the wall. It is not difficult to remove the tape from the dispenser, so it is easy to use. The tape is not one-hundred percent see through, since the matte finish makes it looks glossy. The stickiness of the tape is excellent, which makes the product a reliable one in most circumstances, such as a school project.",5,Perfect For Gift Wrapping,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",0.3579
5,A18NPNRL7UB7DD,B00005C3YY,Kimberly L. Ellis bathory,"[0, 0]",Scotch Magic Tape is the only kind of tape I buy. I have used cheaper tapes. They pale in comparison. Magic tape is virtually invisible when applied. It is sturdy yet able to be sliced with a fingernail when you need to adjust the length of the tape on the fly. Cheap tapes just twist and crumple. No frustration with Magic tape. Did I mention that it is the only kind of tape I buy?!,5,Fantastic Tape!!,1336176000,"05 5, 2012",0.0414

11,A2PD27UKAD3Q00,B00005C3YY,Wilhelmina Zeitgeist coolartsybabe,"[0, 0]","I've been using Scotch Magic Tape since I was a kid. I think it came out during the early 1960's, maybe late 1950's. We always had the Scotch Tape in the red package before this one came out and then it's been the green one for me ever since. Gee, I guess I've been using this tape for around 50 years. I guess that makes me 3M brand loyal.I was running low on tape and was so happy to find this tape as an Amazon add on item when a little short of $25 for free shipping. It was nice to have a reminder that Amazon carries these little office products I'm always needing around my home.",5,My Favorite Tape,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",0.2278
