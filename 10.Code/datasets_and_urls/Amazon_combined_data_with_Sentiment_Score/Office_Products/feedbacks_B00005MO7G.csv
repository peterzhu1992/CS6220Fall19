0,A38QHZEEYZKT27,B00005MO7G,Amighty Celebrity Poker,"[8, 10]","Definitely works, but is considerably smaller than your average desktop calculator. Also due to this I think, some of the buttons, notably the CE and ON buttons, are on the side of the number pad, not above it, as I am used to. Altho this would seem minor it makes for some fumbling around with the keys every time.If small is good for you think about this calkeylator, otherwise go for a regular one.",3,Smallish,1191369600,"10 3, 2007",0.244

The summer swelts, as it is apt to do, but what about you? Worry not. Traipse onward to your favorite creamery. How often can you do this? That's where the calculator comes in.Work in your figuring confectionery and coffee shop visits, stops by the corner hot dog vendor, and the lovely friend you might bring along to each celebration of taste. Consider taxes, tips, and extra chocolate sprinkles. This math will take a focused mind, and an accurate calculator.Large numbers, visible digits, and extra buttons for those with the mathematical acumen to enjoy them, the Canon calculator sits snugly on any desk or cafe counter. It will suffice most dining needs, powered by sunny days and ice cream desires.Ensure the goodness of a year filled with flavor, well-paced through each week by knowing the cost and averages of chocolate, cappuccino and gelato. Be prepared for hot fudge sundaes, mochas and nougat bars. When December comes, as the year has passed, you will be able to tell the one you love, This one's on me, with confidence, as you will have studied the numbers on your Canon calculator.--Brockeim",5,Excellent Tool for Counting Confectionery Shop Visits,1184544000,"07 16, 2007",0.3305

4,A3GNRMHCTL5K3U,B00005MO7G,Lombard Street,"[4, 4]","It has an eye-angled, upright display, and is perfect to work on a desk. The keypad is not as soft as other calculators on the market, giving you a retro and reliable feel (if you have ever used those full size desktop calculators popular a decade ago, you know what I am talking about.)I find other calculators (e.g., Sharp EL-377T) awkward to use on a desk. They are perfect for handheld. If you want to have a calculator on your desk and operate with one hand and without leaning forward to check the LCD screen, this Canon LS-82Z is perfect for you.",5,eye-angled display,1286841600,"10 12, 2010",0.4859
5,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00005MO7G,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[8, 9]","Canon makes a fine small pocket calculator that I trust. I understand, of course, that some people will want this for the same reasons I wanted it while other people would never be satisfied with this calculator. Therefore, here are the pros and cons of this calculator:PROS:1) It can use either solar power or battery power.2) The keys are pretty much the right size.3) The numbers on the screen are relatively easy to read and it's got a memory feature.4) The calculator comes with a function card. This will help you or refresh your memory as to how to use this calculator to its maximum potential.5) This product is relatively inexpensive; this is perfect for anyone who wants an affordable pocket calculator.6) The display is angled toward the viewer's eyes so it's easy to read the display--and the display doesn't even need full brightness in order for you to read it!CONS:1) It doesn't have features that a statistician would want. If you want to use this for matrix and vector calculations, you're flat out of luck. Get a scientific calculator instead.2) The change sign button is very difficult to even notice--it's on the % button!3) The three key limit on the memory function may frustrate people.Overall, this calculator is perfect for anyone who wants a regular, reliable and inexpensive calculator just to do basic functions. Again, statisticians and other people will not be satisfied with this; but I was pleased overall. It's a great calculator for most people; and so I'll give this a four star review.",4,not bad at all--despite a couple of minor flaws,1245369600,"06 19, 2009",0.4124
6,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00005MO7G,Patricia A Reader,"[5, 11]","I first saw the CANON LS-82z calculator at my local bank. Itwas anchored to a table, so no one would take it, and wasthere for people to tally up deposits and/or withdrawals. It isso little, so useful, so -- well, cute -- that I found myselfanthropomorphizing it, (that is, turning an innanimate objectinto something which is living...at least in my imagination,and falling completely in love with the adorable littlecalculator at first sight, (and use!). I wanted so much to takeit home with me, (as a calculator -- AND pet!) Perhaps it'sdue to the fact that I live in a no-pet building that helpedfoister these, er....feelings in me, but the fact is that it ISa rather small and compact little calculator, (only 3.5 x 4.5 x1.2 inches in size), has easy-to-use hard, (but not too hard)plastic keys, and a nice big 8-digit display! It also seemedjust the right size fit in my hand...though, of course, tetheredas it was to the table in the bank, I couldn't try it out. No --I did NOT hear the little calculator say, Take me home with you!-- but it was fun to IMAGINE it was saying this. I also knew thebank had probably searched very carefully to find the right modelcalculator to put on the bank table. So -- with this free advicethat this was a good calculator, (which the bank had unknowinglygiven me -- and every other bank customer!), and my own immediateliking to it -- though I knew I couldn't take the bank's modelhome with me, I did the next best thing: I wrote down the modelnumber, and looked for it on the internet. Sure enough -- therethe calculator I had seen in the bank, (or maybe one of it'sfirst or second cousins!), was there on Amazon! Immediately, Iliberated....er, that is, bought...two of them, hoping, (in myimagination, that is), that these little calculators would finda happy home in my condo!When the calculators arrived, I took one out of its proteciveplastic casing, and immediately put the number 107734 on it.Then I turned the calculator upside down. As with any calculator,the word heLLO! appeared on the screen. (There's a whole bookof these calculator tricks, which I mean to look up on Amazonas at the earliest opportunity!)Well, the little Canon LS=82z does fit nicely in the palm of myhand, and works just as well in my home, as it does at thebank. The keys are HARD plastic -- which means they do NOT getsoft and difficult to use after a while. However, hard doesnot mean difficult here -- the keys are a pleasure to use!They are small enough to keep the size of the calculator down,but big enough for adult hands to use. And -- this IS a solarAND battery calculator. You can always test this on any calcu-lator. Just be sure the calculator is on, and showing numbers.Then put your finger over the solar-battery panel. If thenumbers fade, then the calculator is a solar-powered calculator,only. If they do not fade, then obviously a battery is in thecalculator, too -- as is the case here.It's true this calculator has only a three-key memory, and somepeople find this a great inconvenience. To me, it's only a veryminor inconvenience, and one I can easily live with. The change-sign (from plus to minus, or vice versa), key is strangely printedon the same key as %. Sadly, there seems no way to use thechange sign function, as directions are not given on the back ofthe package, and there are no other directions given. I don'tchange the sign, often -- so again, this is a minor inconvenience,for me. But if you must change signs from plus to minus, or viceversa, often, I sadlty must suggest you adopt another calculator.The biggest disappointment, though, is that, although this ISpowered by a battery, (presumably a button model), as well as solarpower, THERE ARE ONLY TWO SCREWS, ON TOP, IN THE BACK OF THECALCULATOR. This means that it's all but impossible to take thebattery out, and one will be left, eventually, with the choice ofeither using this as only a solar calculator, or getting anothercalculator altogether. A mean thing to do to both calculator...and user.Still, I plan to use and enjoy my litte LS-82z. And if I anthropor-morphize once in a while, what of it? Sometime back, an entireTV show, ('WONDERFALLS'), was based on this idea of anthropormorph-ism. It stayed on the air only a short time...but during thattime, made money for everyone connected in its production!",4,Y O U ...C A N ...

Since this is dual powered, it will last longer and you can recharge it with solar power.The size of this calculator is nice because it fits in your hand while you calculate away.
