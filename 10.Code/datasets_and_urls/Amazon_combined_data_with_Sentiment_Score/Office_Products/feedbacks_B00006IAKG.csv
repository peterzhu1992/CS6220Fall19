4,A2PQUL8TI4P4HV,B00006IAKG,Nakkiel,"[1, 1]","I just needed this to organize clutter such as note pads, discs for my computer, take-out menus, tape, etc. This is slightly larger than I expected. I need to keep it off to the side of my desk instead of on it. It does work as a simple separator, but bends VERY easily. It came with nearly every separator bent out of place, and only took a slight push to bend them back. I suppose this can be good if you want to add a slant, but it can't hold any weight.",3,Works.,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",0.1596

I love it so much I think I might buy another one for my Textbooks. the book ends I bought were junk. Also perfect for the price!
