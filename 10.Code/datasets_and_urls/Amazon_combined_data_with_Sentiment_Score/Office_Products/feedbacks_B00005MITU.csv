I had bought an AT&T; Trimline phone that was really poor - it didn't have the features that I expected, and remembered. I bought one of these in white color for my wife, and then found that it was so good that I ordered the black model for myself.This phone has a backlit screen (excellent for night-time calls), powered by the phone line - no batteries required. The light intensity isn't very high, but is readable in the dark. I found the quick dial use to be fine, although I was a bit surprised that one needs to program in the emergency number (isn't 911 standard?), but maybe some people want to call their relatives in an emergency or something. I have mine wall mounted, although the unit works either wall or desk.The phone is handsome, and the features (handset and ringer volume, quick dial, etc) work well.The only drawback is that the handset is fairly large. I am 6' tall with big hands, and it fits me fine, but if you are purchasing for a smaller hand you might need a different model.",5,Great phone for the price,1253664000,"09 23, 2009",0.1313

Several people said people on the other end cannot hear well. I immediately tested mine, and called 2 friends, who both said they could hear me quite clearly. It is funny how there are always people who harshly criticize products in these reviews, yet so many other people do not find anything wrong, I wonder how that can be, can there really be such a big difference between one unit and another. I thought I would like the Black color best, and it cost less than the White, but I see now that the Black shows finger print smudges very easily.

We bought three of these (one for our house, shop, and my mother's house) to use mostly as backup for when our various cordless phones become unusable in during power outages (more frequent than I like in our area).We have these connected to line splitters (Belkin RJ11 Plug/2-RJ11 Jack Modular T Adapter) and they work just fine. These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which, although limited, does give us some control. It is also handy that the keypad is backlit and draws power directly from the phone line, allowing you to see the numbers in the dark.While these phones do have the ability to store numbers and even speed-dial, we have not set them up to do it.Highly Recommended!CFH",5,Works Even When The Power Is Out - Highly Recommended,1284768000,"09 18, 2010",0.1661
8,A1SHHQSPOWR00F,B00005MITU,E --,"[6, 6]","I used to work for a large telephone company including time spent in a Central Office or CO. The CO is the place where your telephone lines go after leaving your house and where the telephone company has all of its equipment. I also did field telecommunications in the Army.In a natural disaster, cell phone towers have a very limited amount of battery backup. That means your cell phone will not work about 5 - 8 hours after an earthquake. That's what happened to all of us after the '89 Loma Prieta earthquake.However, for landlines, the telephone company maintains a very extensive system of battery backup power in the Central Office so your landline phone will continue to work even after an emergency or after losing power (yes, your corded phone uses some electricity to work, but that electricity is produced by the phone company). In fact, after the regular battery backup power is exhausted in the CO, the phone company has the capability to drop generator trucks to run the equipment and keep your corded phone working indefinitely.There also are other technical reasons that you want a landline in a natural disaster instead of a cell phone, but basically the equipment running your landline can handle many more calls when everyone picks up the phone at the same time to call 911 and their aunt Mildred.So, bottom line, keep your landline phone line and one of these very inexpensive AT&T; 210 CORDED phones on hand, if only for emergencies or when the power goes out and you can't use your cordless phone or cell phone. By the way, the voice quality of my two AT&T; 210's are excellent.",5,This phone will save your life,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",0.018

When the power goes out, however, they are helpless. I do have a deep cycle battery and power inverter for when the power goes out, but having this basic phone allows me to have a phone without drawing power from my deep cycle battery. I can check with the power company, talk with neighbors, and potentially most important, if there's an emergency I can immediately dial for help.Everyone who owns a phone that plugs into an electric outlet and who lives in an area likely to experience power outages should have one of these for when the power fails.

(The power lines in our area are aboveground, but most telephone lines are underground. During storms, we often lose electrical power, but the phone lines are usually intact. The cordless phones, which require AC power, are useless at those times, but a hard-wired phone still works.) When our hard-wired phone recently died after about twenty-five years of service, we replaced it with the AT&T; 210 Corded Phone. It's a fine telephone, reminiscent in style of the old AT&T; Princess Phone of the 1960s, but modernized with memory-dial. Other than that, it's pretty much a basic, bare-bones telephone, which is what we need during power outages.The AT&T; 210 appears to be solidly built, and we expect to get many years of service from it.

The phone comes with a longish cord to plug into the phone base and phone jack. If you need the standard short cord to use with a typical wall mounted base there is a slot under the base to wrap the cord instead of providing a shorter second cord. I like this!

Regardless of whether an outage lasts an hour or days, when the electricity goes out, out nifty, convenience packed, cordless, electronic phones do not function. Cell phones never work, regardless of the weather, because of our mountainous location.When the electricity goes off, we go old school and pull this corded phone out of the junk drawer. Using it means being tethered to the wall with a very limited range of mobility. At any other time it would be a hassle to use, but is like a gift from above during the times when it is the only option for communicating with the outside world.The twisty cord gets easily knotted up and the base is made too light. Unless hung from the wall, expect the base to skitter all about the counter top when the cord is pulled on even slightly.

It still sounds a bit like I'm down in a hole, tinny I guess, but it's better than some of the others that I've tried.The base is really light weight, so if it's not hung on a wall (which you can do with this one) it will probably pull off the table if you stretch the phone and it's cored too far from it's base.It has a lighted key pad, sort of (the light is really faint).So, it works, has some options that are OK, and if you want one like they used to make, this is OK, but not perfect.",4,"Not retro, not modern, just a nice phone that works",1315785600,"09 12, 2011",0.2685

This telephone by AT&T; works better than other, much fancier phones, including two expensive cordless phones with extra handsets, when I had to get a new phone for my new home. The construction of this telephone reflects great engineering; and it's very, very reliable for a price that's very inexpensive these days for a phone. Yes, it is corded; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job.The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired. The buttons could be brighter but the back lighting does improve upon no lighting. The phone offers well known features including last number redial, and allows you to set the phone up with your telephone company so that you can use this phone with features like call waiting and three way calling. The phone has a mute feature, adjustable ringer volume and more. These functions never disappoint me. It also has a small knob that lets you switch between touch tone and pulse (rotary) dialing. I use touch tone dialing as most people do. I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing. Cool!If you want to take a nap without the phone ringing, just turn the ringer off by using the knob at the base of the phone.I highly recommend this telephone for people who need a basic phone at a cheap price that still has a few frills to like including memory speed dialing and call waiting. The extra features give you all you truly need to make this a well constructed telephone at a ridiculously inexpensive price. Sure, the back lighting for the buttons on the phone could be brighter; but overall this is still quite a good phone for the price.
