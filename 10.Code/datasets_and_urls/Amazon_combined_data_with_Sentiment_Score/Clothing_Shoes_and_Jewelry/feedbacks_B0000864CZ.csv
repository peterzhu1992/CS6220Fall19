They're very cute too! One note -- if the fabric you're wearing is white or somewhat sheer, you might want to buy tan petals instead, as the pink is very light and will show through as a white bra would.",5,Perfect,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",0.3855

After buying two other more expensive pairs, one too light (who would have thought that Jennifer Lopez was considered &#34;dark&#34;) and one whose reviewers swore it was adhesive and it wasn't , I finally found these again and they arrived quickly . I'm SO pleased!!!!!",5,Perfection,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",0.1673

3,A3BUONF9B5RP1J,B0000864CZ,Justina,"[0, 0]","These work very well. Love the color and the feel. Stick on very smooth and can't see under clothing unless it's a light colored thin shirt. Best I've found for the price. Very easy on the skin and easy to take off, no pain at all, and stay on all day long. Middles sometimes tend to puff out if sitting or laying a certain way but go back when standing up. Great for the price and no pain when removing!",4,Great for the price!,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",0.4829

5,A2LX85V0TVHUQK,B0000864CZ,Mandi,"[0, 0]",The pink color was very faint - almost white. The quality on these was a little disappointing as well. The little pad in the middle was way off-center on almost every one. They didn't stick as well as other brands i've tried as well. Would not buy again.,2,Will not buy this brand again,1391385600,"02 3, 2014",-0.0386

7,AWL3TRWMO9BDW,B0000864CZ,Xyrana,"[0, 0]","I made a Halloween costume, but it soon became apparent that the inside wasn't padded well enough... Ordered these pretty much last-minute, got them the day of the party, and I must say that they certainly did their job! I couldn't even tell I was wearing them, either. After the party, I ended up falling asleep with them on, and even then when I went to take them off the next day, it didn't hurt at all. It pulled just a tiny bit, like pulling off one of those cheap bandaids with really weak adhesive. Also, they hadn't come off at all during the night, and I toss and turn a lot when I sleep, so they seem to last well.I was wearing something with a little bit of padding, so I can't speak for how well they will do underneath something very thin, like whether or not the edges will show.",5,Works quite well,1384646400,"11 17, 2013",0.2563
