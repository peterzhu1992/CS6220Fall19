I sometimes have a hard time finding them in department stores so was very glad to be able to buy them on the Internet. They are comfortable. They allow a little forgiveness when you gain a bit here and there without stretching out if you lose a bit (I wish more often). They also wash and wear very easily and simply. I can even throw them in the dryer. What's not to love? :),5,Briefly Yours,1245542400,"06 21, 2009",0.3469

They're perfect for anyone who doesn't like bikini or high-rise panties. After three babies, I can't wear those things anymore. The fabric moves with you, and they're practically invisible under clothing. I add Oxi-Clean to the detergent when I wash them, as chlorine bleach does a number on them.
