My husband normally wears a 32/34 and I got this in a 38. They are just right. There is no way a 32 would have fit. Also, these were approx $40 cheaper then at my local farm store.",5,Great fit/great price!,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",0.1173

We tried them on in a store to make sure we knew what size to get to go over his regular work clothes. We do not wash them daily. They last longer that way. Pay attention to the little things, there are 2 styles in these. The pockets are different!",5,Carhartt,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",0.109
3,A20D2ZFUVB06QI,B0000ASFQL,Bigten418,"[4, 5]","I'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased--I will admit that I haven't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time--I had no idea how low the quality has gotten. First, the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily, 2. The canvas material is not what it used to be either, my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same. 3. The sizes are so different, I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear, but when they were delivered and I tried them on, it was as if they were two sizes smaller. The material is thin, and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be. I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product, to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases. The quality is very low, but the prices are way too high for the quality.",2,Carhartt Bibs/Cover-All,1352937600,"11 15, 2012",-0.1808
4,A3QSZ2SE3HUSXM,B0000ASFQL,bluezman714,"[0, 0]","I ordered a 40x32. I should've ordered a 40x30, but that was my error. Subzero temps are comfortable with these on. I wear a pair of jeans under them. I'm 5'10 and weigh 170 lbs. I washed them twice and the length did shrink about an inch but I have to wear boots with them or they will drag onto the ground at the bottom/back of the legs. These are well worth the price. Being my first Bibs, I expect to buy a new one yearly, but in a size 40x30.Update:Now that spring is here, these bibs are great and worked perfectly! They are must have in Colorado. When washing them, follow the instructions!I recommend going to your local Carhartt store (Sears?) and trying a pair on to get your sizing perfect. Even if they don't have the lined bibs, they will have the unlined and it's so important you get the length of your bibs right or you will ruin them as they rub on the ground.Next Fall I will buy the unlined version in a different color and may get a size of 38x28. The reasoning for the 38 instead of the 40 is that the lined pair are thick and at times with jeans on underneath, it did get toasty.I've been to my local Sears and have tried on the unlined version which are $30 cheaper, but I could see that as long as I had jeans on underneath and maybe thermals under the jeans, the unlined will be just as comfortable. Obviously you want to buy them on Amazon!The length in the next pair will definitely be a 30 length (instead of the 32 I bought)or maybe even a 28 length, because they adjust in length at the suspenders.So UNDERSTAND this fact: When they say they are a 30 in length, keep in mind that's the shortest length they adjust to. So my 32 in length bibs I bought are 32 at the shortest length possible and they will actually adjust (at the suspenders) 3-4 longer than the length stated!!!!",5,Great,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",0.1774
5,A18PCUCGTW7RP9,B0000ASFQL,BRef,"[22, 24]","The quality of this item is very good, the reason I rated it 3 stars is because it is very hard to size these correctly. I've just ordered my third pair, hopefully these will be right. I went to the carhartt website and ordered as they suggested, the first pair was too large, the second too small, I hope the third will be just right. I would suggest you try these on in a store first to get the right size. Amazon's return policy and quick shipping has been top notch, the only thing is I have to return and re-order rather than return for an exchange.Edit: Well the third pair did not fit me like I would have liked, but it will have to do. Try these on before you buy.",3,Very hard to fit,1293667200,"12 30, 2010",0.2319
6,A33EEX2DOYPLSV,B0000ASFQL,Duff123,"[0, 0]","I have these for occasional electrical work with my brother-in-law and for general use during the winter. I have used it several times now in cold weather and kneeling in the snow. So far they have been exceptional! They are very warm when wearing a pair of pants under these and then a coat with it as well. I have not felt the cold on my legs or core when wearing these bibs so far. They fit very comfortably. Other users have mentioned how to determine the sizing so I will not go into great detail over that, but I normally wear a 32&#34; waist and got a 34&#34; in waist for the bibs and they fit well/almost snug when wearing a normal pair of pants under them. Also I have the 32&#34; length as that is my normal length in pants and they fit just fine without dragging on the ground at all. Overall they are warm (as I have used with a windchill in the single digits already), they are comfortable & flexible while still being very sturdy and should be very durable for years to come! Great purchase for outside winter workers and those of us who want a good warm pair of bibs that we may never have to replace!",5,Great bibs at a great price!,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",0.3583

Maybe this is my mistake for not checking the size in the store before buying from Amazon.That said, Carhartt makes legendary work clothes, as durable as they come, and these are no exception. I wear them on my Harley riding to work at 5:30 in the morning and my legs are nice and toasty.",5,"Great product as always - but beware, they run a bit tight",1330300800,"02 27, 2012",0.0631

He's purchased carhartts for more than 30 years and knows they always run small so he opted for 2 sizes bigger than normal in the insulated bibs and,as it turns out, the largest size carhartt offers. Sadly they were still at least 2 sizes too small! He was soooo disappointed to have to return these and purchase an brand other than carhartt. Wish Carhartt would review their sizing and offer a bit more of the larger sizes AND more accurate sizing information.As I said... sadly, these were returned. :(",2,Had to return,1402012800,"06 6, 2014",-0.2364

15,A1UT7AQOQIMQJF,B0000ASFQL,Nico DeMarzo,"[0, 0]",Make sure you order about 10 sizes larger than what you need. These are meant to be warn over other layers of clothing so you need to take in account for that. I wear a size 36 waist so I got a 46 and it fits great over jeans with thermals underneath. Fits great also over just jeans. Like all Carhartt products its warm and durable. I highly recommend it for anyone working out in cold conditions.

Having said that, what we get here is nothing compared to other areas on the USA, but for here, a 1/2 shuts the schools down. We've had a number of snows producing several feet and on our 360' driveway thats allot of shoveling. I got the Carhartt Men's Quilt Lined Duck Bib Overall for my fiance and they were fabulous. While running the snow blower he was comfortable, warm and not soaking wet. Actually, he had to take his jacket off. He wore them over jeans, but they were warm enough that you really would only need long underwear under them.Although, this is not really the place for this review I will say that I also bought him a pair of Carhartt Men's Insulated Waterproof Breathable Gloves ASIN: B002VWJWYU which he loved and at Amazon you will see 18 reviews and almost stars.You cannot go wrong with Carhartt.",5,"Warm, water resistant & comfortable",1300838400,"03 23, 2011",0.3509
