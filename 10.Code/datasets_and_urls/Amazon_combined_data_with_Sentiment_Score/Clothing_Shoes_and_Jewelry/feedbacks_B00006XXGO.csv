These were cheaper than the chucks on the converse website so I took a chance and am happy that I did. They are the same ones I get every time, perfect size, perfect fit.

Once she found out they come in pink, no other color would do. Sigh. But they are SUPER cute, and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and won't come off, but lots of room to grow through the toes. One drawback, the laces are hard for a toddler to manage, and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself.",5,"I like them and my brothers (age 1) like them and Daddy likes them. -Alyx, age 2 1/2",1373155200,"07 7, 2013",0.173

She has who knows how many pairs of Chucks (over 20), and always seems to wear a different color every day. So to be a good friend, I had to get a pair. Red, being one of my favorite colors, seemed the right choice. I bought size 6.5 Men's, which translates to 8.5 Women's. The fit is good! These are heavier than I would have expected, but they aren't uncomfortably so. They are very sturdy considering so much of them is made from canvas. My feet feel well supported.

10,AOXVR30698014,B00006XXGO,C. Fong Serious Shoes,"[0, 0]","They say that it takes a real man to wear pink, but even among women and girls who wear Converse, pink is an uncommon color. These make quite a statement no matter what crowd you run with. In some ways it can even be a safety measure, as they make you easy to identify in a multitide. Because they are so unique, people that wouldn't normally remember or even pay you a second glance will tend to look twice and/or learn to recognize you - I think that alone makes these worth the money compared to any other shoe.In addition, unlike many shoes, Converse don't mind being thrown in the washing machine for occasional cleaning (just avoid the bleach, or you'll fade them quite fast). Thus, I don't mind wearing these everywhere, because if they get dirty it's no big deal.Speaking of fading, pink Converse have to be worn for awhile before they resemble the color of the image shown - they are a bit more bright, deep pink than they appear. They are not neon pink (a separate and easily distinguished color), but nonetheless pinker than the image.Converse almost invariably seem to run a half size larger, and these are no exception. So if you're a 9.5, get a 9, etc. These were my very first pair, and I'm glad that I tried them on in a store to learn this before ordering - it would have been a rather unpleasant surprise.Also true to most Converse, these have little to no arch support, a thinner sole compared to most modern shoes (i.e. you'll feel it if you step on a rock or such), and don't take too kindly to being worn in the rain, mud, snow, etc. I certainly wouldn't run a mile or take a hike in them.

After extreme wear, some parts that are glued can get loosened. Shoe goo can be used to make most if not all repairs on these. So they can last longer than nearly any shoe. They make them exactly like they did decades ago, with the same quality, with one caveat, Converse, the iconic American shoes, are now made in China. This may or may not matter to you. It does matter to me, due to labor practices, and environmental standards, which is why I typically buy New Balance shoes, still made in the USA as of 2013. I've worn made in USA converse in the past, but never the new China-made ones. On arrival I couldn't tell any difference in the shoe itself, just as sturdy as ever.On a side note: This particular style is pretty trendy among celebrities. My wife saw this color/style on some female singer and had to have them. Lots of female celebrities buy these male high-tops.
