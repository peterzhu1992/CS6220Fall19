0,A3SC04DC5TLYSP,B00004SR8Z,Amanda Winstead,"[8, 11]","This pouch is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and I liked the very adjustable strap. However, I would like for the pouch to be a couple of inches longer to accommodate the length of a standard boarding pass. I was surprised that it was too short as it seems to me that travel documents would the the most likely thing to store here, but it could not be closed unless I bent the passes which then made them difficult to remove. A minor gripe, overall I'm satisfied.",3,Would like it to be a bit longer,1335139200,"04 23, 2012",0.272

A basic passport and money holder for travel. The color is not like the picture at all, but I am keeping it and letting him decide.The very light beige will get dirty quickly.The zippered section is fine. I wish the passport section had a zipper instead of velcro. For the price, it is adequate.",4,Small but functional,1323648000,"12 12, 2011",0.1659
2,A1WCJS4L2L1WQ,B00004SR8Z,book-lover,"[1, 1]","I bought two of these pouches for a recent vacation to Europe. It was comfortable to wear as long as I didn't put too much in it. It was fine with credit cards, driver's license and some cash but when I added my passport it became a bit heavy and bulky, but not prohibitively so. I think if you are planning on carrying your passport with credit cards it will work well for you, but if you are not planning on carrying your passport around, a pouch that is smaller might work better.This pouch is likely a good size if you are carrying quite a bit of stuff, but it will stick out under your clothes if your passport is in it. A lot more comfortable with only a bit of cash and credit cards.It is also a l longer in length than I realized. Its so long that I could wear it around my neck and tuck it into my pants. My daughter refused to wear it since it is quite bulky under your clothes.",4,did the job,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",0.2991

4,A1X6ZPF88LTHGJ,B00004SR8Z,Debra,"[0, 0]","I recently used this neck stash on a two week trip to France. It was wonderful! I loved it at the airport and at train stations, especially. It is so helpful to have my hands free yet my passport and bording pass (or train ticket) ready to pull right out instead of fumbling in a purse. I also carried money and credit cards in it and in extremely crowded tourist areas (like the Eiffel Tower) I wore it under my shirt for extra security. It's lightweight and the adjustable neck strap, when adjusted properly, makes this pretty unnoticeable under a shirt. I love the different compartments, as this makes it easier to find what you're looking for right away.",5,Excellent travel accessory,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",0.5992

I debate if I really should not give it 5 stars as it does everything it advertises itself. When I travel out of country, I have this around my neck and under one layer of clothing. I have my &#34;throw away&#34; wallet in my pocket with expired cards and a few dollars.I like the various pockets and zippered security to keep things in place. The neck cord is a little long so I had to tie it off so the stash would fall mid chest making it a bit more concealed.4.5 stars - minus 1/2 star for long cord and a flimsy feel.

I find this a very good arrangement. Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket. I also like the adjustment on the length of cord so you can wear it high or lower.
