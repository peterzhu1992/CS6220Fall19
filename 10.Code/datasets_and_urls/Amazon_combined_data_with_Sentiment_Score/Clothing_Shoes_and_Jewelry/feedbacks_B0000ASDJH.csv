0,A1V6F5FDBH49YI,B0000ASDJH,A. Claymaker,"[7, 7]",I wear these sock with my running shoes in the winter. Running shoes aren't very warm so adding a wool sock makes them wearable in winter. They're nice and springy but not too bulky so they fit nicely with my shoes.,5,Nice and warm,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",0.2157
1,A2ZY49IDE6TY5I,B0000ASDJH,Crabigail Cassidy Crabby Abby,"[1, 1]","I normally wouldn't pay $15 or more for a pair of socks and I didn't in this case. These were on sale for around $10 a pair, and I bought three pair in gray and they have been well worth it.These socks offer superior cushioning in the areas that most typically take the greatest abuse. They don't slip or shift as you wear them and they prevent chaffing and rubbing. The keep my feet warm and dry as they have superior wicking quality. I go for long walks in the woods near my house and my feet feel good afterward which I can only attribute to my hiking boots and these socks. I even poke around the house in these socks because they are comfortable and provide decent traction on hard wood floorsFor what it's worth, I've been wearing these for quite awhile now and they seem to be wearing better than my other socks. No piling or signs of thinning in spots such as the heels which usually go first. They wash up nicely and while not specifically listed as antimicrobial, these keep my feet dry and fresh smelling.",5,Offers A Lot Of Comfort Features,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",0.3841
