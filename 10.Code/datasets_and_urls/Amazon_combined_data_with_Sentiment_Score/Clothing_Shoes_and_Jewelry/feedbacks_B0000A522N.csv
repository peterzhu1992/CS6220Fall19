Ok, I admit I'm in my mid forties but I'm sorry the multicolored goofball shoes I saw didn't impress me much, they just look ridiculous. These however have a simple clean look and are some of the best fitting athletic shoes I've ever owned. I like a snug fit and these fit like a glove. You might not be the gym peacock but your workout won't suffer.",5,No Clown Shoes from the mall here,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",0.4641
