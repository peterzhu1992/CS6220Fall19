The price is great..also like the fact the advertising is at a minimal, just a tiny tag on the left side. my bf loves seeing me in these because it shows off my body which is a turn on for him ;) ya so go order these, or don't, more for me :)",5,My everyday undies,1385596800,"11 28, 2013",0.5729
8,ADGDDAGTBVECC,B00008KI3U,G. W. Meador Gary,"[0, 0]","What can I say about Jockey underwear? They last a long time, come in some great colors, fit well and are inexpensive. I have tried other brands of underwear but it seems like I always come back to Jockey for one reason or another. They work for me and I would definitely recommend them.",5,Jockey Elance,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",0.4916
9,A1D9B1RBLRZY4C,B00008KI3U,infantry11m,"[2, 2]",The waist fit fine but the overall fit was poor. The leg openings were tight and they would sit so low that they fell off my rear at times. especially if I was getting up and down.

10,A191V1YHGWJ7MV,B00008KI3U,Jason,"[10, 12]","I used to wear Jockey Elance Bikini Briefs exclusively, but in the past year they have changed their design. I am a larger framed man with a 48 inch waist and I have always worn the XL size. They have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them. But the last few times I bought this product, they have a smaller, tighter fit. Very tight in the pouch and between the legs. They also have a lower cut, both in the front and back. I'm constantly pulling them up in the back. My junk is popping out of the top and the sides! These might fit a woman comfortably, but not a man. There's no stretchiness or room in the front for the boys. This bikini would be better if Jockey offered it in other facrics such as Modal, Tactel or Nylon. I don't know why Jockey changed their design, but I don't like it and I will not buy this product again until they change it back. Sometimes change is a bad thing... and this is a bad thing!May sound odd, but Jockey makes women's panties that are FAR more comfortable compared to Elance bikinis for men!",2,"They've changed, and not for the better",1294444800,"01 8, 2011",0.0855

I think Jockey may be discontinuing this line as the price was great, and I could not find the Elance at the local department store. The only down side was that he wanted all black but could not order this color in the 3-pack. Shipping was good and the package arrived in good shape.",5,Good fit.,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",0.5151
