1,A2K3J2X8KDY47N,B0000AZ10I,Jewelry Lover me,"[3, 3]","I like wearing these earrings - they are simple and classic in design and since I require gold posts (get knots in my ears with other types of metal posts), the challenge is being able to afford multiple pairs and colors. For $33, I am quite satisfied with these even though the stones are not as bright and darkly colored as the picture indicates (hence four stars for this truth in advertising issue). The posts are sturdy and backs fit securely. Peridote stones are translucent and free of visible inclusions. The color goes nicely with my spring wardrobe. Appropriate for all ages. I'd highly recommend them.",4,great earrings - but stones not as dark as the picture shows,1300233600,"03 16, 2011",0.411
2,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,B0000AZ10I,JO,"[3, 3]","I'm very pleased with this purchase, especially having bought them during an Amazon sale. The blue is clear and bright, the setting is secure, and they fit well on the ears. The post is a little higher than center so I often find myself turning them to be sure they are falling correctly, but it really doesn't make a difference. The white gold really complements the blue and I much prefer these set in white rather than yellow gold because of the very cool color of the stones. For those who have light colored eyes, these are especially complementary. I have received numerous compliments when wearing these and I wear these very, very often, sometimes not removing them for weeks at a time.",5,Beautiful quality,1186444800,"08 7, 2007",0.3932
3,AAPPWNP9FWVWS,B0000AZ10I,Kathlyn Storey Kathlyn A Storey,"[11, 11]","Peridot is my birthstone. Twenty to 30 years ago, I purchased 6 mm round peridot earrings for around $110 from I. Magnin. The oval earrings from Amazon compare favorably in the amount of gold and stone size. From there, the color and cut of the perfectly matched peridots on the Amazon pair are clearly superior. The picture doesn't do them justice. These earrings cost me less than $18 including super saver shipping. Anyone who loves peridots is going to love these earrings.",5,Beautiful Peridot earrings,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",0.3435
4,A5BJMAHZWGJ7N,B0000AZ10I,Melaina Lara,"[2, 3]","I got these as a daily deal, and I'm so glad that I did. Even though I had to wait a couple months, they are worth it. The price is fantastic, (even the regularly listed price), for a very nice cut, vibrantly green and well matched stone. The setting is sturdy, and ranks right up there with very expensive jewelers. Simply a can't miss earring!",5,Sweet deal!,1202688000,"02 11, 2008",0.3519
