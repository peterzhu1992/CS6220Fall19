0,A2NUBL2UYWPBWR,B00007AS82,C,"[1, 1]","This bag is perfect for the new 10 netbooks. I have an Asus 1000he and have been having trouble finding a lightweight and attractive bag for it. The larger battery (9.5 hrs) makes it just a touch too big for most 10 bags and sleeves out there.I can fit my netbook in its neoprene sleeve in the main section, portable DVD drive, portable HD, power brick and cords for them all. The outside pocket holds my wallet, Ipod, Iphone, pens and a small pad of paper. My plane ticket goes in the back zippered pocket. There are NO MAGNETS anywhere on this bag.The best part is when I want to travel light, I can take out the rest of the netbook accessories and the bag slims right down. Or I can use this as a lightweight crossbody bag that just happens to have my netbook in it. There is plenty of room for that and purse things.The vertical profile makes it easy to get the netbook in and out and redistributes the weight more ergonomically. Fully loaded, it feels much lighter than a similar horizontal bag. I love that this bag is lightweight to begin with, unlike specialized laptop bags that weigh more than the laptop itself empty!It is not meant to be a laptop bag, but the extra space in the bag enables you to add more padding and protection if you want to and still end up lighter when fully packed than an empty off-the-shelf Staples netbook bag. You'd be a lot more stylish too.The black, navy and slate colors are guy friendly and look like a cool and compact crossbody bag. The shoulder strap extends to comfortably fit a medium-build guy. The main compartment measures 2depth & the front compartment is an extra 3/4.",5,Perfect 10 Netbook bag and messenger bag.,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",0.2749

Many compartments as I like and this holds twice as much as other brand bags while weighing less. Fits my iPad without a problem (in slim case). The design makes this bag not too bulky for me.,5,Flipping over this bag,1347926400,"09 18, 2012",0.3457
2,AR964PME0LTNX,B00007AS82,Half Pint,"[0, 0]","I purchased this due to the good reviews it has on Amazon. I plan to use it for long day trips, weekend trips, and vacations. It has plenty of room, separate sections, and extras that will work out great for holding all kinds of stuff! I can't wait to use it! I have smaller bags like this where the strap goes across the body, and I prefer that when traveling or walking around all day long, but I definitely needed a bigger one (but not too big - haha). I feel safer knowing it can't be stolen from me and it is also more comfortable to wear. It is made well and I like that the material will repel water. Great bag!",5,Will Make An Awesome Travel Bag/Purse!,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",0.5157

While I think it is plain for me for everyday, it makes a fabulous travel or day trip bag, especially if you have children. The bag is lightweight with tons of organization. The strap is comfortable and doesn't rub and burn your skin. it's a durable but soft, unlike some other nylon strap bags I own (and need to get rid of because they don't compare!)",5,My Disneyland/travel bag,1279065600,"07 14, 2010",0.2075

This is almost identical in style so it was easy to transition all of my items into this secure bag and still have them relatively in the same spots. As a bonus - this bag is lighter! It even appears to be water resistant, although I don't plan to test that theory. It holds my wallet, make up bag, small umbrella, two pairs of glasses, ear buds, cell phone, Kindle, and various little items in the interior small zip sections like keys, gum, kleenex, etc. I even squeezed a lunch bag on top and was still able to zip it shut thanks to the adjustable flap snap. This will be a great bag for travel as well but for day to day commuting into the city with slots for everything and everything secured with zippers, it's great. And although it lists for $78 on numerous websites, I found it on Amazon for $55. Sweet! Thanks, Amazon! Oh and the monkey is cute too.",5,Great commuter/travel bag,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",0.5241
