With one brand we had trouble with the rubber sole separating from the rest of the sandal. Sometimes you could fix it with Shoe Goo, sometimes not. I recognized Columbia as a good brand and bought a pair on the large side, since he is still growing. So far we're doing fine. One can tell by inspection it is a much better sandal than sandals selling for half the price. So, though it is more expensive than some other brands at department stores, I think this is a good value in the long run. Comfortable and attractive, too.",5,Great quality.

The grip on the bottom is really good, but its a hard material so they seem like they wont wear out fast or hurt your feet when you step on a sharp rock. The stitching, velcro and straps all seem very good. Most comfortable sandals Ive had yet, the rubber you step on is squishy. They also have a lip in the front which helps protect your toes and keep them planted in the sandal. I ordered a 13 and they seem very true to size. hope they last!",5,h2o,1280188800,"07 27, 2010",0.4721
2,AWE98CMHS5NE5,B0000AU0DH,J. Ream,"[0, 0]","I was going whitewater rafting for my bachelor party and wanted sandals I could wear in the river. I also wanted them to last. I turned to Columbia. The sandals are decently comfortable, but take some breaking in. Expect a sore foot the first 3-5 wears.The sizing was accurate and I did not feel that they were too big or too small.The only problem I had (well two...) was that they did not stay on very well in the river. The front strap kept being pulled over my toes so my foot was resting on top of the front strap. This was rather inconvenient while trying to prevent yourself from drowning in raging rapids. The second is my wife hates them and thinks they make me look like a computer nerd - if only I wore socks with them.The water had no ill-effects on the material.",3,Purchased for watersports,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",-0.0709

I used them on a long walk down the boardwalk and regretted wearing them on the way back, and even went barefoot for the last few blocks. Would be better if that back strap was adjustable to tighten things up if needed. Even my cheap old OP sandals have that.",4,Nice for the beach,1311724800,"07 27, 2011",0.1406

Returned those without a hitch, and ordered 9s. These fit much better. The velcro straps make for easy adjustment. Nice thick soles and solid construction. I've taken up hiking/backpacking and got these for camp shoes; I suspect these'll serve for a good long time.",5,Nice sandals!,1282953600,"08 28, 2010",0.2578
