0,APWK2EKIA0PVN,B0000ANEXJ,Fiona's Mom,"[0, 0]","These socks are lightweight, yet very cushiony. They make my feet feel great inside my hiking boots. I think they're especially good for older feet that are getting more sensitive in the heel area.",5,Very comfortable and supportive,1360627200,"02 12, 2013",0.3725
1,A382A4DO3XQWVT,B0000ANEXJ,Happy Mac User mb_77,"[0, 0]","These socks are absolutely amazing, and I cannot believe how much better my feet feel after long walks or workouts with wearing them. They make all of the difference in the world.I learned about the Cool Max sox from reading Leslie Sansone's book, and decided I should use all of the research that the US Army put into finding which socks held up well for soldiers in the field. These are for walking workouts, and have excellent cushioning just where you need it, plus they wick away moisture.Your feet will love you for getting these!",5,"$15 for a pair of socks? Well, it is worth it!",1338940800,"06 6, 2012",0.7216
2,A1CWGPQ4RMQBAM,B0000ANEXJ,H D,"[0, 0]",These are the best fitting and most comfortable socks that I have ever worn. They cushion the feet where needed and do not shift or fall down. They launder very well. Well worth the price. I still have some socks from this company that are almost 20 years old!,5,great fitting socks,1401494400,"05 31, 2014",0.3123

4,A272JDNEVXGADX,B0000ANEXJ,Y. Bijan,"[0, 0]","The sock fits well, but it doesn't stay up. The cushioning is very nice and makes the sock thick. I think it keeps my feet warm and not cool. I like to wear them around the house when my feet are tires because of the cushioning, but they aren't the summer hiking sock I wanted them to be.",3,okay,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",0.1975
