0,A3UBCBATB4P2Y1,B0000B35D9,Amazon Customer forever dieter,"[5, 5]",I wanted a 1 gold hoop and found it with these earrings. The gold is shiny and beautiful. The clasp is solid and stays together. It is hard to find this size hoop. These are replacing a very large pair my husband bought me for Christmas. (They were so huge that I looked like DUMBO!)These are perfect to wear for dress-up or casual. I wear lot of turtlenecks so was looking for a pair that would not get caught all the time in them. This is the perfect size.I also have very short hair - so these earrings complement my hair style without overpowering me.They are also very comfortable - so much so that I sometimes forget I have earrings on.Buy with confidence. These earrings will delight anyone looking for a decent quality and reasonably sized gold hoop.,5,Beautiful gold earrings,1230508800,"12 29, 2008",0.3484

Perfect 14K yellow gold color, not brassy-looking at all like some gold is, they are the perfect size - 1 in diameter. Well made, yet light in gram weight, the post snaps shut with a nice click and doesn't feel like they will easily come unsnapped. The hinge seems to be high-quality and strong too. They are the perfect earring for me.",5,The perfect go to earring - 7 YEAR UPDATE,1252281600,"09 7, 2009",0.5246
