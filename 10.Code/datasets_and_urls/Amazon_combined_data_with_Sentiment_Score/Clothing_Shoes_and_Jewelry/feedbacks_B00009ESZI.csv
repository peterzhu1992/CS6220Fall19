1,A2MJ8OL2FYN7CW,B00009ESZI,Lynne E. Lynne E.,"[9, 9]","LOLLIPOP has long been a leading brand of 100% cotton underwear, and the quality is still very good. For everyday wear, I much prefer cotton over silk or nylon, because of cotton's superior comfort and absorbency. I've worn Lollipops since childhood, and I still prefer this cotton leg band or cuff leg model over the equally good model with the elastic cuff.The Lollipop package claims that Lollipops keep their fit wash after wash without shrinking. Maybe that's true if you follow the recommendation to machine wash cold, hang dry. However, my Lollipops are machine washed and machine dried with other whites (using settings for permanent press and low heat), and they ALWAYS shrink.To allow for shrinkage, I go up one or two sizes when I buy ANY brand of cotton panties. For Lollipops, the package recommends: size 5 (hips 36-37); 6 (38-39), 7 (40-41), 8 (42-43), 9(44-45), 10 (46-47), 11 (48-49), and 12 (50-51). I wear women's size 10/12 pants, and my hips measure 40 over clothing. I find that size 8 is my best choice for Lollipops. Either size 7 or size 8 will work for me when new (7 fits, 8 fits loosely), but size 8 continues to fit after the panties shrink from multiple machine washings (and dryings).",5,Superior 100% Cotton Panties (Go Up at Least One Size),1381449600,"10 11, 2013",0.3823

4,A1LFSTBR7L7PUT,B00009ESZI,V. Wiedemann 2 avid readers,"[1, 1]","I much prefer the wider leg bands and far smaller leg openings in these Lollipop briefs. Compared to the regular Vanity Fair undies or several other brands, these are definitely the best fitting (they actually cover your butt!) and most comfortable. They do not seem to shrink when they are washed and the quality of the cotton seems like it will last quite a while. I did have a problem with the elastic coming loose at the side seam on one pair purchased a while ago but mended it by hand and it has been OK.Younger women might be comfortable in underpants that only cover part of their rear end and/or tummy but for old ladies like me, this style is perfect. They cover everything I want to have covered, right up to the waist! In fact, they come up higher than most of my jeans and other casual wear pants, but that's not a problem.I don't think anyone makes a cotton brief that will last 5 or 6 years like I used to buy from Jockey many years ago, but for what you can get these days at a reasonable price I think these are the best buy.",4,Comfortable and practical cotton panties!,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",0.5323
