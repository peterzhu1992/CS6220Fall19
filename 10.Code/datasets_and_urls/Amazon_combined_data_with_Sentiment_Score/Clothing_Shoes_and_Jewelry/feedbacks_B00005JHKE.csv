1,AKJHHD5VEH7VG,B00005JHKE,Dominique,"[0, 0]","I ordered this for my son, who was invited to a Superhearo party. He has been in a solid size 6 and sometimes goes up to a 7. I think this costume runs a bit small. It fit him perfectly but if he wore a 7, I think it would be too tight.The costume is of average durability. Parents used to ordering these types of costumes will find it average. If I had to wash this every week, it might not make it past 6 months.I didn't order any gloves to go with this, he wanted them but didn't need them. Unless it's a chilly Halloween night, save your $ and skip the gloves as well.Overall my son loves this costume. He's not a fan of the velcroe back. it bothers him, so we leave the back open, he's usually wearing a shirt underneath anyway.We were going to a party in the spring. The costume is quite warm. The material is thin but the overall effect left him overheated in the sun. Please keep this in mind if you're using the costume in a warmer climate.It is a good value for the price.",3,Runs a bit small,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",0.2376
2,AJGN47OUGFDIT,B00005JHKE,flyladyjax,"[0, 0]","Yelp, I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play. It is really cheaply made. It's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks. And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it doesn't give them a place to breath out of . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so don't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume",1,Guaranteed to Rip on Your 1st day of play,1298332800,"02 22, 2011",0.0221
