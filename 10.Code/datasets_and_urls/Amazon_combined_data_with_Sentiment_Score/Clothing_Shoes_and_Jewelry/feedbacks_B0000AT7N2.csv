Ditto on most brands of khakis, the office rat's jeans. After purchasing a couple pairs of Carhartt's excellent khakis, I decided to try their jeans. I have never before had a better fit in a pair of jeans,or a more correct sizing of the waist and inseam. They are so comfortable my wife has to steal them away to wash them, so I got more of them. I have several Carhartt products and I can assure you they are made for maximum durabilty, value and comfort for the working man. The relaxed fit version is especially comfortable on horseback because it allows your legs to move without pulling down the waist.

I like the fact that Carhartt has a very broad selection of both styles and sizes to choose from. I am at the weird end of the spectrum body type wise, and am very skinny, but long legged. A 30 waist but a 34 inseam...yeah, I am all leg! My son is better proportioned and has a 32 waist and 30 inseam. Finding jeans that fit me is difficult. But, thankfully, Carhartt has pants that fit me. I really enjoy the jeans I got, except for the fact that they only have 5 belt loops instead of the 7 I am used to. My son's relaxed fit jeans are great. He wears them frequently. He is into body building and needs a jean that does't fit too tightly to his thighs (which are understandably quite large now). So these relaxed fit jeans fill the bill nicely. He doesn't feel pinched or bound up in them and finds them to be all-day comfortable. Construction is rugged and quality is excellent. They fit well and wash/dry well. These are really high quality jeans and worth the price. Oh, and the price was very NICE.",5,Bought these for my son. He Loves them.,1349568000,"10 7, 2012",0.4102

But, before ordering I tried on two pairs of my current jeans to make sure I liked the size they were. I did, so I ordered that size, but these are much tighter than my other jeans of the same size from other manufacturers. They are tighter in the legs and waist. I think part of the problem with the waist may be because if you look at the picture you will see the waist band is higher than many other types of jeans. So, the higher waist band rides higher up closer to my belly button compared to my other jeans. And, ummm lets say my six pack of abs bulges out a bit more by my belly button than it does down on my actual waist. I've never had jeans that ride this high in the waist, so that probably explains some of my sizing issues.But over all these are constructed well, and I have quit doing situps in hopes that my rock hard bulging belly muscles will get smaller so the waist will fit better.

59,AMW2I30QL5L93,B0000AT7N2,Star,"[0, 0]","I bought one pair of these for my husband to see if he liked them. When I saw the quality and heard him talk about the comfort, I immediately ordered another pair.....should have ordered a couple more AND I WILL! I usually order Levi's relaxed but these seem to last so much longer and have the extra room men always want in certain areas (said that as nicely as I could). Now, after washing a couple times, I will no longer purchase those other jeans which are very weak in the pockets/crotch area and seem to tear easily. These Carhartt jeans are amazing! My husband really loves the comfort. I'd recommend them for work, as well as, dress jeans. Very handsome! You get much more quality with Carhartt and pay less. You can't beat that!UPDATED: May 15, 2014 The last jeans I purchased were washed three times and have torn on all corners of the back pockets. I should not have been so quick to give such a great review since the one pair held up pretty good. In looking at them again, the pocket corners are all thin and fraying/tearing ONE MONTH LATER. I use a light laundry detergent and don't leave them in the washer so it can't be that. I guess I will have to continue my search for those sturdy work jeans. If anyone has suggestions, please let me know. Thank you!UPDATED:June 21, 2014 THESE JEANS SUCK! I am returning all three pairs I bought to Carhardt. The entire seat of these jeans finally just ripped two months and just a few washes later. I have already patched all three pairs twice.
