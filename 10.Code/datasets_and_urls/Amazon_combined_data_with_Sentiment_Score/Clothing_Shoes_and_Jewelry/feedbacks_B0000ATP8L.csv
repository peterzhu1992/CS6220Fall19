Unfortunately, the quality is not as good as in the past. The sizing leaves a lot to be desired. As suggested by some other reviewers, I ordered the shoes size larger than I had in the past. The length was OK, but the medium width is more wide. I also ordered a pair of Rockport sport shoes. They were size 11, but barely. The width was just OK. I will order shoes again, but will not be surprised if they need to be returned for poor size quality control.6month follow up: I have been wearing these a lot. The more I wear them, the more pain I get. Went to a real shoe store and was shown that the front lateral side of the shoe tapers more narrowly starting near the base of my little toe. The more I walk, especially with orthotics, the more the side of my foot is compressed. Not good. This was not present on previous shoes. I bought a pair of SAS shoes that do not taper. Much, much better. I have worn Rockports for over 20 years. This latest pair don't make it. Lift the sole cover on the inside. Could it be cardboard?

44,A1RODQFI08SIJQ,B0000ATP8L,Sushrut Patel,"[17, 21]","I bought this shoe(9.5 W, chocolate nu buck) because of glowing tributes on this and other sites. The shoe felt great on trying it on initially. I agree with other reviewers that the supplied thin PU insole is laughably thin, and non supportive, creating a false aura of roominess and comfort which does not stand up to(pun intended) prolonged non-recumbency. It DOES NOT have the ADIPRENE insoles that most other Rockports do. The unusually THICK TONGUE covers most of the dorsum (Top) of the foot....and competes for room...you have to open up the laces wide to accommodate it, or your arch top will start hurting. I tried a comfort insole, but it left little room for my toes. I banished the shoe to the back of my rack. Recently(after 3 months), I revisited the shoe, and remembered my previous travails. I trashed the insole first. Then I progressively stuffed paper napkins into the toe and ball area, leaving it overnight for a few days, to stretch it. Finally I equipped it with a my favorite spenco insoleSpenco Polysorb Cross Trainer, Women's 9-10 / Men's 8-9. So, after a few days of foot & heartache, and a few hours daily D&C; (dilatation and curettage), the shoe is very usable and comfortable for my 12-18 hour duties as a physician. In the mean time, I discovered and am using a pair ofClarks Men's Wave.Tract Lace Upwhich are very comfortable and supportive without any modifications for my purpose of prolonged walking and standing.Addendum: some musings after 18 months of occasional use: 1/6/1014,I have worn this shoe about 50-60 times, and they look and feel great. It has a wide flat platform, and is great/stable for standing, but not as good as some other more modern designs for prolonged walking. The nubuck leather (color is more medium tan rather than chocolate as advertised) has maintained its finish, thanks in part to initial treatment withKiwi Suede and Nubuck Protector, 4.25 ozand occasional use ofKiwi Suede Nubuck CleanerI reach out for these shoes when I want a tan colored shoe that I will wear all day. They fit a little high around the anke, and I tend to use them more in spring and fall, when it is not rainy.

For that kind of walking I use a more athletic, cushioned and flexible style of shoe than this one. I bought this shoe for occasions where I wanted a shoe that looked better but would be comfortable walking up to two miles. It fits that bill but I wouldn't recommend it for longer walks. It is too stiff for that.",4,Good casual walking shoe,1368316800,"05 12, 2013",0.147

The nubuck finish is a bit suede like, but not as fussy, I like the look and the color. I notice an inconsistency in the inner-sole of one of the shoes. The foot feels a very slight but annoying change in sole thickness just in back of the toes. When I ordered an additional pair in black, that same inconsistency was even more evident in one of the shoes - so I returned that pair. Be aware of the error - you may need to return them as well if the feel is apparent to you.Based on my last pair, I expect these will last beyond my interest period. At some point you just want a new pair of shoes and these things refuse to die! I use them for everyday use for all but dressy occasions.",4,Comfort Casual,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",-0.0053

They have been the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and have held up under sometimes very punishing conditions due to the nature of my work. I have really liked their cushioned Vibram soles. Alas, all good things come to an end and it finally got to the point where my poor Rockports were looking pretty grungy and worn at the heels. I paid several visits to various Houston stores that carry Rockports, but none of them carried the Classic Walking Shoe type, which is exactly what I wanted. I then decided to give Amazon a try.This is the first time I've ever taken the chance of purchasing shoes on line. I'm usually VERY picky about my shoes because I have to spend so much time on my feet in my job, which also includes having to stand for many hours at a time at conventions, etc. Too often, shoes just don't fit properly on my narrow feet. When my Rockports arrived from Amazon, I was only a little disappointed that they felt just a touch smaller than I would have liked. I told myself, however, that my old Rockports have been well worn in and have probably stretched out over time to arrive at that perfect feeling that they now have, so I've decided to hang on to these and give them a chance to break in as well.If this works out for me, I will probably consider making my future shoe purchases online with Amazon as well. Their prices seem to be competitive and the shoes were delivered to me in a matter of a few days. I highly recommend these shoes as a kind of casual dress shoe for those who spend a lot of time on their feet but need something more than sneakers or other less dressy type shoes.",4,Purchased the Rockport World Tour Classic Walking Shoe to replace my very worn out Rockports,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",0.1622
49,A1N80G2PR4P23J,B0000ATP8L,W. L. Cummins,"[0, 0]","These Rockports have a straight last, which I personally much prefer over a curved last because of the type of arch support I find to be the most comfortable when wearing a pair of shoes for a long stretch (like when going to the Fair and walking all day). They tend toward sizing a tad small, so if you're in between, go for a 1/2 size up, and being able to get an 11-N is a luxury for me. I broke them in (yes, they're not wear-ready right of the box) by wearing them around the house for a few days. Since they've softened up, they have been my choice of foot wear over my old white tennies and my NB walking shoes. I have other Rocs and my feet love 'em. I'm not worried about the nice clean look--they'll get spills and dirt with time. I could use any of several products to keep them pristine looking (Scotchguard is good), but I'd rather they aged naturally. Great shoes. Great price at Amazon (I put them on my Wish List and then just waited for the price to plummet).",5,solid comfort,1240185600,"04 20, 2009",0.4225
