3,A3IS3JGEHZ2YFU,B0000865II,JJ,"[11, 11]","I am so happy with these... they feel great and very sturdy. The sizing chart was accurate... I am 5'6/200 and I ordered 1x/2x which fit fine. The control top is very comfortable compared to other brands. The fabric is very smooth, not too flimsy but not suffocatingly thick either. It also is not snagging like other nylons, nor do I notice any pilling. They are so comfortable, and I expect to get many more wears out of these. I am so impressed with these I just bought 2 more pairs.",5,These are awesome!,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",0.3772
