Carhartt, on the other hand, makes tee shirts like they did 40 years ago, with nice thick fabric that you know will last for years. It's a relief to get a product that is made of really good material. Highly recommended.",5,These guys make real tee shirts,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",0.4579

It's so difficult to find clothes that fit when you're big and tall (tall, dark and handsome if I do say so myself). I usually wear the same clothes every year until they wear out but now I have bought a new wardrobe, basically. I've spent $500 or so on Carhartt clothes in the past few months and I don't regret it. I wish they would make sweat pants!These are very thick material, really nice design. I don't mind the big logos like some people--I like how it adds extra color and style. These will last me for years, no doubt about it.Also, these are made very loose. I would say 1 size larger than most cheaper clothes. If I wear one of those generic clothes (which I don't mind wearing btw) I usually have to order like a 5X because they are so small. I definatley like a loose fit so it suits me perfectly. However, if you like your clothes to have a classic, tighter fit I would order a size smaller. Their hoodies are pretty true to size but their long and short sleeve tees I would for sure buy a size smaller.So yeah, these are way more expensive than I normally pay. There are t-shirts I can buy at the mall 5 for $20 but they have literally started falling apart just after one summer. So it's worth it to buy these because I know they will last.Awesome brand! If you're not sure then go ahead and buy it because I don't think you will be disappointed.",5,"High quality, loose fit, and I love the pocket",1329868800,"02 22, 2012",0.3037

You gotta be a big corn-fed American boy to sport one of these.Running it through the dryer made it worse; the neck hole shrank but the other dimensions remained almost unchanged.

I usually buy oversize to allow for shrinkage of cotton knit fabric but it is not necessary with these shirts. They come oversize. It's best to wash them before wearing since they will fit huge until they shrink down in length and girth. It's also recommended that you wash the darker colors separately--at least at first. I hand washed all the T-shirts I ordered before wearing and the Port colored one turned the water in the sink red. Be careful until the excess color has washed out. I have noted overall fading with the older black Carhartt T-shirt I have. This is after several months of wear and washing.I've bought several of these shirts in various colors. They are head and shoulders better than the cheap T-shirts you can find at Target or Walmart although they are more expensive. They are comfortable for work wear and look nice under an unbuttoned sport shirt for casual get-togethers.

The armholes allow easy motion, and the body of the tall-sized shirt is longer than the norm of tall sizes from other manufacturers. Both features ensure all-day comfort for the active wearer. This holds for work and play duties alike. The only quibble: There's a small, cheesy (cheap-looking) manufacturer label on the front of the breast pocket.

But this shirt was a disappointment.It was so scratchy when I opened it that I couldn't stand to wear it. I thought it might be from leftover sizing in the fabric, but it didn't get any better after washing. I even tried the soak in brine technique, which softened it a bit, but it's still scratchier than my other t-shirts. Four washings so far, and it's still scratchy, though it is getting a little better with each washing.I have other pocket t-shirts of comparable thickness from American Giant and Key. Both are much softer and more pleasant to wear than this one, even right out of the package.On the pro side, the fabric is thick, and the size is good. I've gotten medium t-shirts from department stores that shrank to uselessness after a few washings, but this one kept its size pretty well. I also like the color (I got Sand). If only it were more comfortable to wear.*** Update 6 August 2013 ***Nine washings now, and the problem is no better than after the fourth or fifth washing. It still feels prickly the moment I put it on, unlike any of my other t-shirts, including cheap department store ones.I looked at the fabric and it has a fair amount of pilling on the inside of the shirt. So it's pretty clear that the scratchiness is not going to get better. I'm ready to put this one in the grunge clothes bin. I'm guessing it was just a bad batch of cloth.They probably make these shirts in various locations. For reference, mine was made in the Dominican Republic.",3,"Did I get a bad batch?

Carhartt's are absolutely the best but you do have to pay up for them . They are worth it . If a thinner material will do I will try other quality brands like Key's or St Johns Bay if their on sale but truth be told the Carhartt's are best .

While the XL hides my recently acquired larger waist, it's also so large that it could accommodate shoulder pads. Further, the length covers a good part of my pockets in my jeans or shorts. The Large is close to a perfect fit, and just a little big in the shoulders.THEY DID NOT SHRINK when just thrown into the washer and dryer, and came out remarkably almost wrinkle free.I don't know why it's called workwear.

As such the fit is different from each factory, the fabric is a different weight, stretch, softness......and more importantly the sizing and proportions are different. the shirts from mexico are noticeably too wide than the others in the waist.This kind of inconsistent quality of construction and pattern is why I am now on a search......nay, a quest to find a new go-to work/everyday wear t shirt.I no longer trust the Carhartt brand to deliver CONSISTENT fitment. As all companies seem more interested in producing a pleasing product to display nicely on a store shelf, Carhartt too seems more interested in that, rather than FUNCTION and FIT.

I should have no problem with an effing t shirt fitting me.My most recent purchase of jersey knit work t shirts, are produced in Haiti. the shirts from Haiti have the following problems....The neck hole is too low in the back and to high up on my adams apple in the front.The arm holes are too far back on the body of the shirt, as such the fabric bunches up in the arm pit and restricts shoulder movement and gets instantly covered in deodorant wax and pit sweat stains because of the binding up in that area. These shirts cause arm pit camel toe.The shoulders are too tight, the front body panel and the back panel of the the shirt body are identical patterns.......the back panel is supposed to be wider than the front because human backs are always wider than chests. The arm of human beings are not located at the actual sides of our bodies, but rather are clocked more facing forwards on our torsos......as proven by the fact that you cant cross your arms across your back.....easily, but you can cross your arms on your chest.Overall.......the details are fine on these shirts, material, stitching, etc.......but the fitment, proportions, assembly and ultimately ergonomic functionality are so distorted that I will be wearing a different brand in the near future.These shirts are now made to look good........folded on a store shelf.",1,Own over 20 of these.....all same size....all fit differently.,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",-0.0131

They were about $2 cheaper than the store. I noted that Carhartt T's tend to run a little large. I wear a large in most all types of shirts, but wear a medium Carhartt. I stayed pretty true to size after washing and drying. I'm a Carhartt fan!",5,Good Fitting Heavy Shirt,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",0.2583
