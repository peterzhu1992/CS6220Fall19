They're so adorable, and we constantly receive compliments on how cute they are. My daughter has been standing since she was about a month old, and she's actually started to wear out the bottoms from pushing herself along when she's in her walker. Even so, I'm really quite pleased with the construction and materials. They're very easy to slip on wiggly feet, too. These have become my go-to gift for expectant moms with a baby girl on the way.",5,So many compliments!,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",0.4898

5,A2BD4PA680QAY1,B000086Q9O,Passau,"[9, 11]","I have ordered pairs of these infant converse for both my son and my daughter when they were infants. I got so many compliments on them when I took the babies out wearing these shoes. They really made an outfit seem so stylish.The shoes are a very soft material that will be pleasing to your baby. The soles are soft material, as well. I found that these shoes are really best for pre walkers or indoor use while walking, otherwise they get really filthy because the material of the soles is white canvas type material that really shows dirt. I have thrown them in the washing machine but they don't get all of the stains out from walking and can look really dirty, which detracts from the look of the shoe. So, I liked them best when I just used them on the babies before they hit the walking stage. I also don't think that the bottom of these shoes grips well enough for a walker. If you want a pair of converse for a walker then I recommend getting the hard rubber soled converse which will not show dirt as much, and which grip the ground well. You can find them here CONVERSE Kids' All Star Core Ox TodI also feel that these shoes run a bit small so I recommend going the next size up, which will also help you get more use out of them. All in all, they are adorable shoes and the height of baby fashion, and they are comfortable as well. Get a pair and get ready for lots of compliments when your baby wears them!",5,I get so many compliments but best for pre walkers,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",0.4108

My baby takes off her shoes constantly, and these are great because they lace up and she can't get them off. They run slightly big, which is good too. I love them.",5,Awesome,1198627200,"12 26, 2007",0.572
