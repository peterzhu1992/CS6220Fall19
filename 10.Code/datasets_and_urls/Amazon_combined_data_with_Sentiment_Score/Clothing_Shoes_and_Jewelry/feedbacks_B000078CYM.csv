0,A305GU9HMVXL24,B000078CYM,Anna B,"[1, 1]","I have used a version of this bag for many years and keep coming back to it. I tried a Baggallini bag recently and decided I didn't like it so well because it actually had too many compartments for me and I'd forget where I put things. With the Ameribag, I find things more easily. I also need to carry a water bottle with me and this bag has just the right amount of space for it, whereas I didn't have that with my Baggallini. I have lengthened the strap to use it cross-body style, which is more comfortable for me to carry. The extra-small version is just right for me, a short person. The larger ones are a little too big. With this size, I can fit a baglet inside, which can be handy at times. I like that this nylon bag is washable. It cleans up easily!",5,Classic Bag Still Works for Me,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",0.1922
1,A2Y3C8OF23ZUE8,B000078CYM,CP,"[1, 1]","First one arrived with the little plastic hook that connects the bottom strap broken. Not sure I like this way of connecting strap seems cheap where metal may be better way, as women even this size is smaller than previous ones owned by LL Bean. Wanted to have smaller bag hoping to lighten my load, so to speak as my shoulder is paying the price now older. Nice pockets with magnets on outside and set up the same with many pockets. I will use the second one sent to replace first but, will most likely go back to LL Beans. The only thing on that one after years of use the zipper stopped working.",3,Okay,1387152000,"12 16, 2013",0.0159

3,A27XVIR408TNH0,B000078CYM,JBD consumer,"[1, 1]",This bag holds a lot of stuff in easy-to-access pockets. The wide shoulder strap is very comfortable and has a no-slip backing that keeps it in place. The overall design of the bag does seem to cause less stress on my shoulder and back. I will buy another one in a different color.,5,Great Bag!,1278374400,"07 6, 2010",0.0521
4,A3JLWUDJB5QM5L,B000078CYM,L. Diaz,"[1, 3]",I don't like Ameribags because they are too hard to store things in and find things in. I do not like their bag.,2,Not a fan,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",-0.3194
5,A3C51QSKN6EP5R,B000078CYM,Requirements are IT,"[1, 1]","Ordered this, my umpteenth Healthy Back Bag, as a tiny accessory to hold my stuff when we go out to dinner. It's the perfect size, unobtrusive, tastefully black, works with anything I wear. Neither too little, and definitely not big. Holds my Blackberry, a notepad, pen, my sunglasses/change of glasses, and a sundry thing or 2.Love it.",5,Nice handy purse,1258070400,"11 13, 2009",0.3296
6,A1WV33AMQ1ZDM2,B000078CYM,RRatledge,"[0, 0]","I got the desert color - a fantastic, go-with-everything khaki color. This is a very casual bag, so if you dress up every day, it might not be for you. I love that it has a place for everything and I'm hoping to pick up a larger sized Ameribag for traveling. Now they just need to make a Back Bag for lap tops!added 1/11/2012: I just came back to buy my 3rd Ameribag, the brown one this time - it's a beautiful, rich, cognac color. Love it! Also a note on Ameribag's customer service and warranty - a strap that holds a d-ring on the inside of one of my other bags ripped. I gave them a call and they're having me return the bag for fixing or a replacement. Very easy to deal with and very nice people.",5,My new favorite,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",0.4828
7,A2DMQ5BYVYAFGV,B000078CYM,Smart Shopper,"[0, 0]","This is a review of the Crimson color distressed nylon bag, extra small.I have major back problems and chronic pain, and went on a search for a lighter everyday bag. This is perfect. I work in a casual office and can carry this everywhere without worry that it won't be suitable. I have a smaller clutch that I use for occasions that call for more formal attire.While not one of those women who carries around everything but the kitchen sink, I am still amazed at how much I can fit into this bag. Everything that was in my regular purse fits in here, with room to spare. What's more, this bag is noticeably lighter than my purse, which is precisely what I needI agree with other reviewers that the inner water bottle holder is small. However, it does a great job of holding my sunglasses, which is more useful to me for daily use.The only negative is the small, narrow size of the two outer pockets. I love the magnetic closures, but the so-called cell phone pocket is too small for my iPhone with Otterbox case. Instead, I use it for my little pill container. I haven't put anything in the smaller side pocket; seems to small for most things.Other reviewers have rightly pointed out that this is NOT the classic bag, no matter what the advertisement says. It's the newer HBB-evo bag. That doesn't bother me, but it may bother someone else, so I think it's worth mentioning. If you look closely at the picture of the crimson bag, it shows only one flap pocket on the side. There are actually two.I guess I'm so impressed with the overall weight and function of this bag that the outer flap pocket design is really not a big deal. For an organized person like me who strongly believes there should be a place for everything and that everything should be in its place, this is almost perfect.",5,Great alternative to everyday purse,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",0.2444
