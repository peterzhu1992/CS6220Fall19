2,A200FKBEWWO68M,B0000ASFDC,. Chip...,"[1, 2]","I bought this jacket to replace the exact same 4 year old jacket that is starting to show signs of wear on the sleeves and cuffs. This jacket is not exactly the same as the original. They cheapened it up quite a bit. The lining is not of the same quality. The quilting is thinner and the elastic in the cuffs is not as elastic. This jacket is compared to a 4 year old jacket that has been worn three seasons for four years.This jacket appears to be typical of much you buy today. It's made with cheaper material, by an off shore manufacturer for pennies on the dollar.If I had bought this in a 'brick and mortar' store and had other jackets to compare it to, I may have passed it up for a higher quality piece.Still an okay jacket, but not the same.",3,"It's okay, but...",1387152000,"12 16, 2013",0.0197

4,A1T18O5P9JZTP,B0000ASFDC,Dave,"[0, 0]","I got the Sandstone Active Jacket in &#34;mushroom&#34; color, which is exactly as shown in the picture -- it's a tan color but more brown than beige. This jacket - above all - was a great value. I'm not sure if I got an off season discount or what, but when I saw it I jumped on it. The jacket itself is great. I have owned three of these in my lifetime and they're pretty hard to destroy. Mine just got to looking kind of ratty after many years, and need replacement. The quilted flannel lining is warm enough for sub-freezing temps with layers underneath. This is the original work wear jacket. I have seen a bunch of knock offs, but Carhartt is still the king. It's not about the label, it's about the quality.",5,Great jacket,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",0.1841
5,A3OAV4N63O4GXA,B0000ASFDC,dogs2010,"[2, 2]","It is really perfect. The material is stiff until you was it, once that happens the material relaxes a bit and becomes amazing. The jacket is really warm without beign crazy. I wear it with appropriate layers from 65 degrees all the way to 30's. When i make my way up to northern california ill be sure to update this on how the jacket performs in snow and lower temps. I have high hopes. Highly recommended just as with all carhartt products.",5,Outstanding in any weather,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.3064

8,AULBF5I0N9YNJ,B0000ASFDC,Jane R.,"[0, 0]","This jacket is a different style than some of the other carhartt's such as the camo series that hasn't been around a long time. The hood on this was a couple inches shorter than the other carhartt I purchased. It doesn't quit cover the face, so sent it back. I haven't run in to that style hood since the 90's when carhartt was cut smaller.",2,returned this one,1391644800,"02 6, 2014",-0.0683

I am a small lady, (5'5 120) but I wanted the sleeves to be long enough so I got the men's small, and they are. I also like the longer fit over my hips a little, so you can do work without the jacket ending up above you waist all the time.

14,A2LK03RTCCDQR2,B0000ASFDC,Raynepa,"[3, 3]","I was originally looking at the Sandstone Sierra Jacket but after trying on the Sandstone Active Jacket at a local store, I realized that the active jacket is more suited to getting in and out of a car... less jacket in the arms and waist. Both are very comfortable and warm. The hood serves as a scarf and as a hat when I get caught in the rain, sleet or snow. I am 6'1 and approx 200lbs, the large fits me well, comfortable with some room for layering when needed. Frontier brown is a good shade - not brassy but not flat. I really like this jacket.",5,Great jacket!,1349740800,"10 9, 2012",0.4684
15,A1FA7VUGCJRER6,B0000ASFDC,Reeper,"[54, 54]","I think i found my new favorite jacket.Im always looking for Carhartt jackets or coats and i had the J140 which is basically the same but the outer shell is not as soft.This model is sandstone and is much softer and has a weathered look.The liner is quilted which is much thicker than blanket or thermal lined types.Quilt (and Sherpa) liners are much more comfortable when wearing short sleeve shirts.Its not as heavy as my other coats and yet keeps me nice and toasty even if its 30 deg outside.I can even wear this in colder climate if i layer it with a long sleeve thermal shirt which i prefer than a big bulky jacket.In my experience Carhartt will last you a long time even if you abuse it and this one is no exception.I have a barn coat that i use at work for 11 years and still going strong.You pay a little bit more for this jacket but if it last you a lifetime so what.EditWent up to the mountains today... snow,30 deg. and 50 mph gust.It was cold as hell but this jacket blocked the wind and kept me warm.All i had was a long sleeve t shirt underneath and i was comfortable.Definitely recommended to anybody looking for a warm jacket that is not too bulky.I really want another one with a different color coz i liked it so much.Just be aware that Carhartt makes another jacket exactly like this but its not sandstone.Its just as good but this kind is a much softer outer shell.",5,Good quality jacket,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",0.5234

19,ASX45KPI9YOGD,B0000ASFDC,woodman,"[0, 0]",Love this jacket. Looks and fits great. Only thing is that when working the sleeves seem to pull a little short. Not working they look and fit fine. maybe I need to get use to the elastic cuffs. Overall it's great. Thought of returning and getting a &#34;long&#34; size instead of regular because of the sleeves but the price was more and didn't want the rest of the jacket to look and fit too long.,4,Love this Jacket.,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",0.3947
