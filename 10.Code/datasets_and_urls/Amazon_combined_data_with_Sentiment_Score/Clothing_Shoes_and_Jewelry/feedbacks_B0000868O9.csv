1,AFNE6AFYU3ZVD,B0000868O9,A. Fink,"[0, 0]","I am a solid 32DDD. I've been measured and that is the size of bra I wear in brands across the board. This bra has this weird extra nipple room that I did not need. I'd probably be able to fit a tablespoon in there and fill lit perfectly. It isn't that the cup is too big, it's only this extra nipple space. The bra is also scratchy. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again. I cannot wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room, and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect. I wouldn't compare it to the torpedo boobs you'd see on Marilyn Monroe and the likes, but it definitely does give a point to the breasts. I will only be able to wear this bra with clothing that is thicker, like sweaters, or dresses that are double layered or have thick material. I also ordered Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra. This bra is AMAZING. The Bali Bra in my size has 4 hooks and very large straps also, the cups go very high on the breast, covering almost the entire breast, making it illogical to wear with anything that shows even a little chest (not breast) because the bra is visible.

8,A1B7XXNR5DL4TR,B0000868O9,Cindy T.,"[0, 0]","I've purchased this bra for many years. It is never my only purchase. I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out. Wearing blouses or dressed, or even casual tank tops, can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach area look thicker, and your torso shorter. With this bra, the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at the shoulder straps. No the straps are no elastic and it isn't due to being cheap. the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable. The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they don't have a lot of &#34;give.&#34; They wear like iron and look great through many washes. I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer, nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy the elastic. (sulfates causes sudsing) Try Charlie's Soap. You can purchase it through Earth Fare. You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle, even the moving parts. What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful &#34;stays&#34; on either side of the bra. These push you side tissues towards the front. Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you aren't used to looking so good. You will be glad not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras. Don't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra. Inexpensive doesn't mean it is &#34;cheaply made.&#34; Remember to lean fully forward while making the connections so you distribute tissue. Enjoy this purchase. Cindy T.

Usually I am trying to slightly minimize the overwhelming appearance of my chest (I wear anywhere from a 38G-44C, depending on the brassiere manufacturer), but this rather comfortable buttressed wonder is an all signs point to two Kilmanjaros kind of affair!The sort of high-construct, seamed directly-over-the-nipples cups, heavy-duty, thick-banded bra that macho litterati Ernest Hemmingway and Mickey Spillane would have waxed over, and the Godfather of bras, Howard Hughes would have machinated. And while it does fit great (though runs large), and makeS you feel sexy as all get out, it does NOT work with about 75% of my wardrobe, or most modern wardrobes I would venture, as clingy knits, spandexes and thin t-shirt cottons are the order of day. The back band of the bra sticks WAY out under any rayon-thin, drapey fabric, and that's with the correct size; it is just a clunky kind of bra.But since Amazon sells these Bali Flower Underwire Bras so inexpensively, I decided to keep it anyway. Under thicker shirts the back band is less noticeable (but not the upwards-pointing nipples!). Hell, I might even buy another one in the suggestively named navy, Midnight.

31,AU0LLORGK9IDR,B0000868O9,Julie H. Rose,"[1, 1]","First, some sizing notes: This bra runs big in the band. I wear a 30F or a 32DD, depending on the brand/style. This bra fits me perfectly on the smallest hooks. In the long run, that'll make it uncomfortable and big on me, but it's so awesome otherwise, I'm giving it five stars, especially considering the low price.Small band sizes are hard to find. I'm glad Bali makes some 32 bands. Most American companies do not, and those of us with the unfortunate combo of small band size/large cup size usually have to purchase very pricey European brands. That's another reason I'm giving this bra five stars. I paid sixteen dollars and change for it. It fits as well (and is more comfortable) than most of my fancy high end bras. No, it isn't as pretty, but one does need some plain bras!Yes, this bra is truly old school. It's not stylish enough to be called retro. Has Bali been making this bra since the early 1960's? It looks like that might be true! Thing is, for those of us who are big and saggy, this shape can be very flattering. I'm a small gal with a big chest, and old school bras are really great for my shape. No, I wouldn't wear this under a tight t-shirt, but it's fabulous under any other clothes. I am surprised at how natural it looks with clothes on, 'cause it really gives one old school torpedo shapeOn to the scratchiness that so many are complaining about. Out of the package, this bra feels really fake and almost plastic-y. That sounds awful, doesn't it? Well, I don't find it scratchy on, and believe me, I am very, very sensitive. I'm always complaining about bras! This one is very comfortable! However, I would venture to guess that if it was too tight, it wouldn't be. The elastic seems less scratchy to me than many of my other bras, and this weird fabric actually feels quite good on. Another thing is the straps. Some have complained that they fall down. I am surprised by this, too, as I have very small sloping shoulders and I've found the straps stay up easily.Gals, get fitted. If you're wearing a bra that doesn't fit properly, you'll be making the straps too tight, and that's when they start falling down a lot. A bra in the right size is a must. It's hard to find when you are my size, and I wish this bra came in a size 30, but it's so darned close to perfect and such a great price that I'm very happy with it!",5,Another winner from Bali,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",0.2007
32,AAPPWNP9FWVWS,B0000868O9,Kathlyn Storey Kathlyn A Storey,"[9, 12]","This is nothing short of a screaming deal. If you are full figured, you know what a problem it is to find a decently priced, well made, designer bra. Bali is a name brand in this area, and their bras are excellent quality, and pricey. To get this bra at $7.80, in white, including super saver shipping, is incredible; you cannnot even match this price at outlet stores. I originally bought three of them about three weeks go, and they just arrived. The sizing is true to other Bali bras I have purchased. I just put one on, and it is wonderfully comfortable. One particular feature that was not described on the web page, nor in reviews, is the back closure. It was just what I wanted: four hooks (vertical), in three separate sets (that means there are 12 separate hooks) for providing about one inch play in the width. Again, this type of closure is difficult to find. The only thing that I would have liked was some elastic on the straps; however, they do adjust in front to somewhat avoid cutting into the shoulder. As of today, they are still at this ridiculous price, so I ordered three more.Next day note: I wore the bra for over 10 hours yesterday, and it's the closest thing I've found to not wearing one at all. To address concern in other reviews regarding the shaping, i.e., looking pointy, yes, there is a bit of that. For those who prefer form fitting clothing, this could be a problem. This is not a minimizer bra; those will flatten you out if you prefer that look, but the price you pay is in comfort. At my age, 62, I can tolerate the peaked look because it totally beats the saggy look. I tend to wear my blouses and sweater tops very loose, so that this issue is not a problem for me. At the very least, this bra is perfect for working in the garden, when I'm typically wearing an oversized T-shirt. Another note regarding itching...mine do not, and I have pretty sensitive skin. However, a suggestion would be to wash the bra first before wearing it the first time.May 28, 2014 update: These bras wear and wash well.

46,A3AOUGVJ8R8AIS,B0000868O9,Randi,"[2, 2]","Since I had a need for one, my bras have always come from a certain popular lingerie chain. Mesmerized by their bust boosting miracle bras and fabulous looking models, I really never thought of straying. Problem was, their bras didn't fit me well, and definitely didn't provide me with the shape I desired. Their molded bras made me look saggy and lumpy, albeit bigger, but certainly not flattering. Plus, I was paying $40 to look this way, so I began to look for other options.Enter the Bali Flower Bra..... excellent support for my small bust and a more natural and feminine shape. No longer do I have one single rounded lump for a bust line, but two shapely, lifted and separated breasts! Best &#34;perk&#34; of this bra, a slimmer looking figure. Turns out proper support really smooths things out and emphasizes the waist line... can't argue with that!!Now, at that other bra place, I generally wear a 34A but since that was not an option, I opted for a 32B and I'm glad I did. The tighter band is actually very comfortable and the cup is absolutely perfect (for once, with a little manipulation, I actually fully fill the cups!).Now, if you're a fan of the rounded molded cups, stretchy straps and a seamless appearance, this might not be the bra for you. But if you're looking for a classic, slightly more conical look, and solid support, this bra is perfect. For those who, like me, enjoy wearing vintage clothing, look no further this is the 40s or (less severe) 50s silhouette you are looking for.Finally, the lace. It's pretty, this is a pretty bra, but should you try it on straight out of the package and determine that it's a good fit but far too itchy, wash it once or twice--- you might change your mind.Very happy to find this bra, I certainly will be buying more.",5,Exactly What I've Been Looking For,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",0.5139

Most of the new seamless bras are overly padded and flatten me out.I looked at my local stores but it's very hard to find a seamed bra that isn't a minimizer in huge sizes. Most start in D cups.This is an attractive bra visually and I would normally just order up one size, but I look like I should be the musical Grease. Or in a 1950's TV show.My husband said I was a walking weapon in this thing. I could use my breasts to poke the eyes out of a potential attacker.It does not look like the photo of it on amazon. Anyone who put this on, would have to push their breasts into the front of the narrow part of the cup to fill it, and would end up looking pointy.",2,I'm 32B but this is too small plus it's ultra pointy.
