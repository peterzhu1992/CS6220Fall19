They help compress my muscles and help align everything. By the end of the day, I'm sore but the next day I feel great. Will definitely buy more.",5,Great,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",0.2739

It is a little delicate if you touch with it surfaces irregular... some strip can fall out. I bought two sizes more thinking about my son could wear it for more time and it will not fit too tight like picture... maybe that is uncomfortable for a kid BUT although that size fit relax but fine the sleeve is too long, I had to cut it so I think that the better way is to buy it in the correct size or maybe one size more and cut the sleeve.

I was told delivery wouldn't take place until 12/21 - 12/27, so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great. I can't tell you how well it fits as it's a gift for my son.",5,Looks & Feels Great,1324080000,"12 17, 2011",0.4886

4,A58RQ97D4N1QP,B0000722HK,Hotswimmer,"[2, 2]","I am a huge fan of Under Armour's workout apparel, and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts, also own several each of Under Armour's Tech T-shirts (0382) and the Loose Gear shirts (0084) - I've written reviews on those as well.Ok, let's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt. It isn't for everybody. It's tight - a compression fit, the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights, but on your upper body. Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit, and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that, it's a high-quality, great-performing shirt. It provides a lot of muscle support, and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry. As I said, not everyone will like the fit, especially at first, but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings. Athletes in competitive team sports - football, hockey, etc. are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you don't have a perfect body needn't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support, regardless of what sport or workout you are into. In fact, if you're just a little bit soft, it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks. You can always wear another shirt over it if you're self-conscious, just don't like how it looks on you, or haven't quite burned off enough fat yet. If you have a good physique, what can I say - you're going to look hot in this shirt. In fact, it's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first. I usually wear a size XL in the other, looser Under Armour shirts, but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these. They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight. I love this shirt in black, but there's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you can't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry. UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat, and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off. I've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up, even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat, but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch (a lot!). Either way, I haven't taken any chances.",5,A Great Workout Shirt,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",0.2352

Kept me cool and wicked away sweat quite nicely. A word of caution, they are a bit sheer, so if you're bashful get a darker color.",5,Great for Running,1365465600,"04 9, 2013",0.0702
6,AMVC9WTXYKNJ1,B0000722HK,J. Edgar Mihelic Skyscraper,"[0, 0]","I fell in love with Under Armour's products four years ago, and that hasn't changed.They were still a niche brand then, on the edge of coming into their own as a major brand in the marketplace.These shirts and their whole line of ...Gear products are the reason why. They had a quality product before the image was built.I stayed away at first, not thinking that an undershirt could be worth the twenty-five clams. I tried some of the competitors first, but a friend of mine was such an advocate I had to try at least one. I'm glad I did. The HeatGear material is perfect. It is firm enough that it does it job in compression -- for me, that means keeping my jiggly bits in place when I work out -- but it is not too tight or thick.I have both the sleeveless and the sleeved version. I like the sleeveless version for working out, because it helps your range of motion with your arms. The sleeved version is nice as an undershirt, but the only problem in that context is that they place their logo on the chest with a high contrast so it shines through the outer shirt. UA has started to offer a sleeved Tactical version of the shirt, which I might buy one or two, but the color choices are limited.They do what they advertise; the material spreads the sweat out and it evaporates faster than cotton. The hold you in place. You are not as hot as some may be while working hard. You are armoured.These are entirely worth the money, and I recommend that you buy a half-dozen or so as soon as you can.",5,You are armoured,1330732800,"03 3, 2012",0.2703

I ordered a large and it was way too tight in the armpits due to the shortness of the sleeves. Hence the reason why UA is now making them with the longer sleeves. I wish they would carry the 3/4 sleeve more.,3,too tight,1315958400,"09 14, 2011",0.1956
