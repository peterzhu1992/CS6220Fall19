They are like a heavy duty control top panyhose but they really lift and tuck the goopy stuff.Recently while trying on some new skirts I turned around and was dismayed at what appeared in the mirror! Horrors! My butt has gone south, but not to worry, I tried the said skirts on with my Spanx and that solved my problem. Now the twins back there look nice and perky...well, not like when I was 16, but maybe when I was a 33 year old dance teacher.The waist and thighs stay in place, no rolling there. Even though I'm a size 2 it does take a little more work to get these babies on. But once they are in place, wow!",5,LIFT AND TUCK!,1221609600,"09 17, 2008",0.0182

I love them. they slim down my legs & love handles enough so I can wear a size lower than what I'd wear without them. easy to manage & they don't really roll down on the top unless I'm hunched over.

6,A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ,B00008KH9C,Bunkster Brown,"[4, 4]","Just got my new pair, and for ME the secret was to go two sizes up. I am 5'4 and weigh 145... according to the chart I'm a B... but the C was even too small for me. Just got the D, and bingo! Perfect! Doesn't seem to roll, and I might actually be able to breathe in the thing. Those who haven't been happy before, try going two sizes up... worked for me~ five stars now!My previous review:I am completely torn about my rating on this one. On the positive side, this product shaves ten pounds off my appearance, easily. So five stars for that. Two negatives though... First, I ordered a size up (from what is recommended at Spanx.com), as everyone seems to suggest. They are still VERY tight, and still roll down. Secondly, I have not even worn them yet... I only tried them on twice with my Maid of Honor gown... maybe had them on for a total of fifteen minutes each time... and all of the stitching on the waistband started to come out in a big, long unravel. It happened in two different places on the waistband. If I hadn't bought them so long ago (well in advance of the wedding), I would have returned them and requested a new pair. Now, I'm here to order another pair, and I think that this time I'll try ordering two sizes up, and see if that stops the rolling problem. I will save the second, damaged pair as a backup for the wedding day. Those two issues caused me to take away two of the five stars that these could potentially be (for me, anyway). One more thing... as it stands now, I couldn't imagine wearing these every day... it really is a GIRDLE! But for a special occasion, or a night out on the town, yessiree!! They do really suck you in and give you that figure you wish you had!

Not exactly revealing, but I felt I needed the protection. Looked fine and liked the way this felt. It was not confining or uncomfortable. Did a good job and I felt confident.Yesterday it was frigid so I decided to use this as an extra layer under my jeggings that are fitted. I wasn't thinking in regard to hiding anything. I just wanted to stay warm. Anyway, when I put the jeggings on I thought they seemed baggy or loose. They've always felt fitted. When I met my friend for lunch she asked me if I was still losing weight because my pants were loose fitting. Ditto for my husband.Spanx work, but darn if I can explain it. They go on easily. While they are fitted to conform to the body they don't feel tight. They are comfortable enough that I forget I'm wearing them.I ordered a medium and since I normally wear an 8 or 10 they are true to size. I have friends who wear plus sizes and tell me the size they wear are consistent with the garment sizes they normally wear.I either hand wash or wash on a gentle cycle using Woolite and air dry.

16,A21IMS76KY1VPC,B00008KH9C,honeysmother Robin,"[6, 6]","to any wardrobe! The thing about these panties are: you HAVE to size up. If you are not sizing up, they are NOT going to fit right, or control what you need them to control. I bought one pair - according to the manufacturer's sizing - and quickly found out that they were too small. Tried the next size up, and got the rolling effect. Tried two sizes up and I was in the zone. They squoze in tight though, so I went three sizes up and found the pair for me. Now, I'm not saying that YOU have to go three sizes up to find the right pair for you, but it is doubtful that the right size will be your normal size. I would start two sizes up to be safe. This seems to be the general consensus from everyone that I know that owns a pair of these. Besides, who wants to feel like a stuffed sausage under your clothes?? Final word: buy the right size. Once you find it, you will see that these are a must. Let's face it, this designer found a niche in the market and now everyone is trying to capatilize on her initiative. Most of them do the trick, but how comfortable are you? The feel of these power panties are fabulous, and once you find the perfect size for you, you can be stylish, smooth, AND comfortable in your clothes.
