0,AMEL533AU04WN,B00008AALU,Carol l Esser,"[1, 1]",Very light weight in texture I sent them back. Still waiting for credit. I thought for the weight they were too expensive. I was looking for more warmth in this product,1,Tights,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.2228

3,A2OK6BEYM8VMRV,B00008AALU,Joy M. Bidlack,"[1, 1]","These are soft on the skin, they fit and they don't sag or bag (i.e. comfortable). I think these are a great value. I also got a pair of smart wool tights - and I'm finding these almost as warm but MUCH more durable and economical. I've bought more.",5,Great!,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",0.3834
4,A2HYYEP7V3D59E,B00008AALU,Megan,"[0, 0]",I go through a lot of tights and these ones have lasted the longest! They fit great and the color I got (lagoon) is awesome! I get a lot of compliments on the color. I have a dog and she likes to jump on me so I get a lot of runs in my tights and I have to throw them out! These tights have stood up to my dog's claws numerous times and they still look good!,4,Love these tights,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",0.4539
