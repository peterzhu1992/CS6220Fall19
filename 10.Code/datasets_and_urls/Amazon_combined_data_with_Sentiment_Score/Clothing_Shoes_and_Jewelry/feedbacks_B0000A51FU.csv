3,A3D7EK8H15BX2I,B0000A51FU,kim,"[1, 2]","Cant really go wrong with K Swiss , have worn them before and love them. Dont typically buy black shoes but had to have them for work. Only thing I would suggest if you have not worn K Swiss before is to maybe try on at a store before ordering online. They run small- you will probably need 1 to 1 1/2 size larger than you normally wear.",5,Cant go wrong with k swiss,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",0.23
4,A304X07E7YH2LJ,B0000A51FU,peace and calm,"[1, 1]",The size is not true. I bought a pair of 6 1/2 about two years ago from a different website and they fits perfectly. So I bought the 6 1/2 again. But they are at least two sizes larger. I have to return the shoes. I am not sure what happened. Did they do it on purpose so people think they have small feet or was it a mistake?,2,Too large,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",-0.0385
5,A2T146ZME7CPKC,B0000A51FU,Teri,"[3, 3]","This is the 3rd pair of K-Swiss sneakers I have purchased, because I love them so much!!! I love the way they fit on my feet, and how they're so soft and cushiony inside. They are also a very light tennis shoe. My sister-in-law looked at them and thought they'd be really heavy, so I handed her one, and she couldn't believe how light it was!!!",5,K-Swiss Luxury Edition Sneakers,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",0.2993
