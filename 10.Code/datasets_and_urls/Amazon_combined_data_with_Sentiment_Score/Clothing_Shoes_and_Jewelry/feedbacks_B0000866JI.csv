0,A2618JUNYRSGHU,B0000866JI,Go Old-Fashion!,"[0, 0]","Sure it fits snug - but that's what it is supposed to do! Also, the garters are wonderful, only one has ripped, but it is easily sewn back together. It makes everything smooth underneath clothes, and is just a fun thing to wear! It has a lot of stretch to it, so that's good for me; I recommend for any lady pursuing the glamour of the 1950s!",5,Lovely!,1401667200,"06 2, 2014",0.578
1,A1JBA3TOZRUPFG,B0000866JI,Lauren,"[1, 2]","This is my second garter from Rago and it's amazing. If you're looking for shapewear, this is the brand you want. Don't bother with Spanx, they're not gonna hold you in. They'll smooth all the lines, but this one will give you the firmed up, 1950s look. I work at a 1950s clothing shop and I'm not the only girl who wears Rago!Also, I'm a petite girl and Rago has sizes for me. Shapewear in smaller sizes can be difficult to come across.Anyway, Rago is an amazing brand, please don't hesitate to get something from them. &#60;3",5,I'll Always Buy Rago!,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",0.2261

3,A1O2R9PHEOZG34,B0000866JI,Maryrose90,"[3, 5]","Purchased this to wear under a formal dress for a wedding. The control and slimming aspects are outstanding; really made my dress hang well. Unfortunately, every time I sat down, the bottom would ride up so once I stood again I would need to slip into the ladies' room to pull it back down. I avoided anything with a seat because it becomes so cumbersome to go to the bathroom and thought this would be a good alternative but it was not. I would buy a Ragu product again just not this style.",3,Did what it was supposed to do I guess,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",0.0903

Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under (Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant) - to help put it on and stockings (Berkshire It Fits)toprevent ride up. Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place. At first it is tight, then comfortable, and then I forget that I have it on. I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on.",5,Rago Open Girdle is wonderful,1299801600,"03 11, 2011",0.2178
