It is comfy in terms of fit but the fabric makes it clingy and warm specially on a humid night.

2,A1AU1G8U8IPXX2,B0000867AN,C. B.,"[0, 0]",I have been buying Shadowline night gowns for years. They took the place of the Vanity Fair ones I use to be able to find. With this recent purchase I noticed that the fabric IS a lighter weight compared to my other Shadlowline gowns. Maybe the company is trying to cut down on their cost and therefore using lighter weight fabric. Either way I love the color and am happy with it. If they go any lighter in the fabric weight I will NOT buy anymore.,4,Love the color of the Deep Lavender,1291334400,"12 3, 2010",0.1109

Little long bare foot, but perfect length in slippers. 5'3&#34; Will come back and purchase other colors and from this company bought darker colors due to not wanting to be sheer looking in the light. These are what I wanted. Wash delicate HE machine and use Tyler detergent. Hang to air dry. Then quick fluff in air HE dryer. Wonderfull in feel and fragrance.",5,"So very nice.

6,A2EVSUXUZL7NTM,B0000867AN,Deborah vendetta,"[0, 0]",I was amazed at the quality of this night gown. The nylon was not the thin flimsy material that you usually see but a nice weight that should hold up well. It washed up beautifully and came out of the dryer wrinkle free . The fit was very accurate and the length was just right . I'm 5ft 3inch and it was perfect!

8,A17BKWISY8YNOY,B0000867AN,French Lavender,"[1, 1]",I was happy to see this style of gown that is almost impossible to find in a store. I had several that were identical to this made by Vanity Fair years ago. They were the best gowns ever. This one by Shadowline is a close second. It's comfortable and lasts a few years before fading. I have the sapphire color which is not see-through. The lighter colors are see-through. It's made in Mexico.,5,Beautiful & Comfortable Nightgown,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",0.2278

I was looking for a pretty but practical peignoir set which is surprisingly hard to find, and I settled on this nightgown with the matching robe. I am 5'7&#34; 150 lbs and wasn't sure whether to get the medium or large. I played it safe and went for the large, but its a bit big and I think the medium would have fit well, at least for the nightgown. I would probably still choose the large robe. The rosy pink is a beautiful deep pink, the gown is the perfect weight for wearing and feels wonderful on. I knock off a star however because as others have mentioned, it is too sheer to wear without the robe, at least for me. I plan to order the short set for summer wear. Maybe several!",4,Sweet and lovely,1363651200,"03 19, 2013",0.3156

14,A20IG24DLFALIA,B0000867AN,Lisa Gem,"[0, 0]","This gown is generous in fit, soft, washes up beautifully and comes out of the dryer with no wrinkles and packs easily. I would suggest going down one size if you are between 1x and 2x. The color is exactly the way the photo shows and is a deep hot pink color. I bought the matching robe as well and the same can be said about it as the nightgown. I do not find it cool to sleep in, as other reviewers mentioned, but it is certainly comfortable and pretty enough to wear it around the house and especially when visiting friends and you want something to throw on quickly to make those bathroom trips in the middle of the night! The style is rather matronly, and is suitable for mixed company or when you need something simple to wear while getting coffee in the morning.",4,Rosy Pink 2X Shadowliine Petals Nightgown,1346803200,"09 5, 2012",0.3492

A red Shadowline...hands down!My previous purchase was from a local upscale dept store and through the years it has seen it's share of some rips and tears; however it is still together, just a lot of wearing, but I will not part with it even though it has now been retired.I'm so glad this item was available...and will be a continued customer of Shadowline (until maybe I have every color) and Amazon...amazing service ~",5,In my experience,1354492800,"12 3, 2012",0.3232

19,A26K3T6L5NYO7L,B0000867AN,PennyPincher,"[1, 1]","Since a few customers have commented that the quality has changed- and I have NOT found this to be the case, I want to include some information from a comment by one of the sellers. It will be after my own review. I have worn these gowns for more than 20 years. I used to purchase them at Dillard's Dept. Stores, but they quit selling them some years ago. I was so happy to find them available here on Amazon because absolutely NOTHING I have found, for any amount of money, has been as nice as the Shadowline. The pale pink, peach, and periwinkle are not quite as opaque as the other colors but I do not find anything unusual about that (think white pants!). If you find the darker colors to be too revealing, you should probably consider flannel nightgowns. Just saying. :-)___________________Shoppers please note: There was a short period of time (late 2011) when Shadowline used a different fabric for the Petals gowns in Holly Red and Deep Lavender. It was not as nice as their traditional Opacitrique fabric. When they changed this in 2012 (and changed the color names to Red and Purple), the listings got mixed up here and were combined into the same page (for Purple and Deep Lavender). ALL of the new Petals gowns are made from the same fabric now, which is their trademarked Opacitrique fabric--the original Shadowline Petals fabric. The new owner is extremely picky about the quality of his products. And I believe the Deep Lavender and Purple are now the same gowns. If you have doubts, it is a simple matter to contact the seller of whichever size & color you are viewing and ask them whether it is Opacitrique fabric: select a size and color, then click on the seller's name that shows up. On the right side of the page, scroll down to the link that says Contact Seller. Hope this helps!",5,STILL THE BEST in 2014,1395619200,"03 24, 2014",0.076
