Either I maneuver myself into the bra after attaching this, or I just get my husband to do it for me. Both ways are annoying, but hey they get the job done. No falling straps!",3,It's okay.,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",-0.0972
1,AIEEK7AHXKZCC,B0000869QI,BeatleBangs1964,"[2, 2]",This is an excellent product that will keep bra straps perfectly aligned and prevents slippage. They are very comfortable and work well with any bra.,5,Keeping Connected,1271462400,"04 17, 2010",0.7691
2,ANQH4ZSSC5M5U,B0000869QI,ElenaD3LV,"[0, 0]","I have very narrow shoulders so my bra straps constantly need hiking up. Many years ago, I finally found a Wacoal that stays put but it no longer fits and is being discontinued. I have tried every single other brand on the planet and they all slip off so I got this to hold them in place. It works perfect. I wish I didn't have the extra bump across my back but it's better than constantly reaching in my shirt to pull up slipping straps. I like that it is adjustable, too.",5,It Works!,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",0.216

5,A1E19ZBPXY24EJ,B0000869QI,M. Avery Mavery,"[1, 2]","This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product! Because the plastic is so slippery, when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to adjust it to your liking, as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders, the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of where you begin when you tried to adjust it. I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast, but Im a size 8 and a B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is. Furthermore, the company I bought this from here on Amazon (i.e. Lady Grace) has an outrageous shipping cost! This piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed catalog (along with this cheap gadget) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it. Total waste :-(",1,Waste of $,1372550400,"06 30, 2013",-0.1246
6,A3BNYC25EOEURJ,B0000869QI,Patricia Kadban,"[0, 0]",I've always had a problem with my bra straps slipping off my shoulders. This has solved that problem. The only thing that you need to do is make sure your bra is hooked and step into it pulling it up from the bottom. Once up the straps will straighten out. It's so nice not having to spend the day pulling up my bra straps.,5,Yea!,1370131200,"06 2, 2013",0.0477
