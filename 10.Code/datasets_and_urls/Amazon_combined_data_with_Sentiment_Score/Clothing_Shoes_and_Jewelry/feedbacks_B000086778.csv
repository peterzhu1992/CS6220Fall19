0,A20V82ECCVK7PN,B000086778,Erin,"[2, 2]",I thought the hooks were too small for my bra straps- but a kind commenter helped me out. I now realize they wrap around the bra strap and hook to themselves. So now that I know how to use the strap it works well but is not super comfortable. I'd recommend it still though because it beats having your straps fall down.,4,Works well but not super comfortable,1342483200,"07 17, 2012",0.0597
1,A13YGY4FR9XNJ3,B000086778,Jackie Peterson,"[0, 0]","For $7 you get 4 of these things - what more can you ask? I bought these as opposed to buying new racerback bras. They are certainly tricky to install - probably best if you ask a friend for help. BUT once in place, they work really well to keep your straps in place, and if you have a top or dress that dips in a little as I do, they are great for helping to hide your straps! The beige color is more of an ivory than a nude, which was my only disappointment. But glad I got them!",4,Great little invention!,1373241600,"07 8, 2013",0.3255

3,AB7KGZMYMOKOO,B000086778,KellyO MnKnL,"[0, 0]","This strap gets the job done, but the clasps come undone very easily for me. And if I do get my bra on without the clasps coming undone, I usually have to do some super-secret-acrobatic trick maneuvers to move the strap to the position I would like it to be. But honestly, a great solution for a common problem, to that I say &#34;Kudos!&#34;",3,"Gets the job done, but...",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",0.5837
4,A209EZ5IWSF0IO,B000086778,Kim Quilter kimquilter,"[0, 0]","So, I love the idea here, but there are some considerations. First, the S/M is more for training bras or people who are very small/petite. So, I wish they would just call it Small rather than S/M. I think most women would need the Large/XL, even though it sounds big, I think it suit more people.Second, the right fit is important because if it's too tight, the part that grabs the back of your bra straps starts to cinch the strap, so you have two, tiny bunches by your shoulder blades that stick out like little bumps on your back.Finally, the clips do slip once in a while, so there is a chance they'll come undone. Then you'll have a swinging strap on your back.Again, I like the idea here, and it's better more often than not. But it's not as revolutionary as I thought it would be. :) I'm still waiting for a better solution.",3,The idea is good...but some flaws,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",0.432

6,A1TQMJ4QZK55ND,B000086778,vamppp,"[1, 1]","I was somewhat skeptical about these straps and I have to admit that it took me a few minutes to figure out how to attach them to my bra, even after looking at the picture on the package. They work GREAT!!!! I gave the clear strap to one of my co-workers to try out and she loves them too. The only drawback is that you have to keep it attached and put your bra on over your head and hook your bra from behind. BUT, if it keeps my bra straps up all day long I will do anything!!!!!!! I am very happy with the product and I ordered the L/XL variety pack with 4 different colored straps. I wear a size 34-B bra so I would expect that unless you are a size 0 that most women would need the L/XL size.",5,Great Product and Great Idea,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",0.2988
