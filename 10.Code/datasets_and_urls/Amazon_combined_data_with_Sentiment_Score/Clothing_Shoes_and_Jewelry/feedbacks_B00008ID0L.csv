My normal underpants hit in the middle of my long horrible line of staples. I ordered these a couple of sizes too big and was much more comfortable. Also (TMI here, sorry!) the blood and serous drainage washed out nicely. These really did hold up well to laundering.",3,hight cut underpants,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",0.1023

2,AELE71XHWS6GJ,B00008ID0L,Carolyn,"[10, 11]","I ordered these Jockey underpants after talking with a friend, who really likes these undies. I ride horses and have issues with rubs from the saddle with almost any other underpants I have tried. This brand fixed my rub problem. I like the covered elastic legs and the high leg cut design. What I did not like is the fact that one color (dark gray) shrank two sizes when I first washed it. The other colors did not shrink (white and heather gray). The company says shrinkage is about 10%, but my experience is that shrinkage is more, particularly from top to bottom, rather than shrinking around. Jockey has also offered to let me return the pair that shrank excessively.",4,Comfy Undies,1212624000,"06 5, 2008",0.0786
3,A31XYQJD1V3O82,B00008ID0L,CGA Vineyard Worker,"[1, 1]","I thought by ordering Jockey I would avoid the generally poor quality of underwear that seems to be in the marketplace these days. Jockey is no better than the rest. The individual panties are not cut the same despite being marked the same size in a 3 pack, and they run small to size and do not provide correct coverage as a French cut.",2,Less than average quality,1344297600,"08 7, 2012",-0.3545

I have been wearing this brand and style of underwear for nearly 25 years, as my body has gone through all shapes and sizes -- and they are the best. They are cut for a full size rear end, which I have always had and still do! Non-binding, comfortable, fit well.

7,A2LA59CEMV78BC,B00008ID0L,Jennifer S. Washburn,"[2, 2]","Apparently, Jockey makes different styles of underwear for sale in stores and online in packages. I got what I thought looked identical to ones I got at JCPenney--every detail was the same, the fiber contents were the same--and when I got them, they were not the same. They do fit pretty well--but not as well as the others I have. They are not soft and silky and stretchy like the ones I got at the store. They are really thick, and so a little hot for summer and they don't have a lot of stretch.",3,"Ok, but not what I expected",1338249600,"05 29, 2012",0.1917
8,A39KXHJ65JRTQD,B00008ID0L,KLGD,"[3, 3]",These seem to be oddly cut. The upside is they can be washed in very hot water and dried and I'm not afraid of damaging or shrinking them.,3,Odd Cut,1380585600,"10 1, 2013",0.0645

This design has the nice french cut, which means they go higher up on your thigh. I buy a new 3 pack about once a quarter. I use the more worn pairs when I go on vacation or on a business trip, and then just throw them away instead of having to come home and wash them...:)These are not the most longest lasting underwear ever, but I sure like them right out of the package. Which is important.
