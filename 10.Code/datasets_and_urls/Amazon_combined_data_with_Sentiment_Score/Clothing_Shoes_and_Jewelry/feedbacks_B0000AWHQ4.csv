1,A2Y561CNJYVPCW,B0000AWHQ4,J. Leach,"[0, 1]","I'll begin by revealing I am 57 years old and thus have been wearing jeans for a full 5 decades. It is safe to say I am aware of what my jean size is. In fact, as I write this review I am wearing a pair of size 33WX32L Wrangler jeans, one pair of several I own.Which brings us to these 2013 model lined Wrangler jeans, purported to be size 33x32. The waist size on this pair is so far off I went straight to the size label to see if I had been shipped the wrong size by mistake. No, the seller apparently got it right but Wrangler has these jeans sized at LEAST one size, if not two, too small. Come on now, Wrangler has been manufacturing jeans longer than I have been alive and this is ridiculous. And, since these came from an Amazon seller, not Amazon directly, guess who pays the return postage?These jeans were labeled as being made in Mexico (assuming THAT label was accurate). I suppose when outsourcing to whichever third world nation is the low bidder, little things such as quality control and accuracy in sizing can be overlooked in the interest of saving a buck (or Peso).Lesson learned: From now on I will try on jeans and personally inspect them before I buy. So much for buying jeans on Amazon, especially from a third party seller such as Sportsman's Guide. And, so much for Wrangler in general.",1,Dissapointed.

2,A1E4MJW0TWQ1US,B0000AWHQ4,Joy Steadman,"[0, 0]","My husband loved these when he first put them on and continued to love them - except that after they were washed, they turned a funny color. They are no longer brown. Instead they look like they were washed with something that bled into the brown threads and I guess it was the dark fleece lining that did it...because the pants were washed alone. They are still wearable. They just look a little odd now. But for around the house and yard, walking dogs, hunting - they'll be fine.",3,Very warm for cold winters.,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",0.1294
3,A27VO4P76UWKJT,B0000AWHQ4,Scott Richmond Glikbach,"[0, 0]","I wear these in the yard and when working in the cold and snow and I love them. They really do help keep me warm in the wind.I wear a 38 x 30 or 32 depending on the cut and style of jean. In work boots these are the perfect length for a person who normally wears a 30 length. The same is true of the width, I am usually a perfect 38 and these fit really well.When I need a pair of jeans for wearing after work I will be looking at Wrangler. Very impressed.",5,Excellent Insulated pants.,1392422400,"02 15, 2014",0.5984
4,A1JZV3SWJ1Q8A3,B0000AWHQ4,Southernguy,"[0, 0]",Heavy fabric. Looks and feels like they will wear well. Warm without too much bulk. Fits like regular jeans. Plenty of room for bending and sitting while working. My winter favorites after just one day outside in them.,5,Just right,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",0.2611
