0,A3IH60N0KKTEIH,B0000B35EG,Amazon Customer Kaye Lane,"[0, 0]","Bought these to match a gold necklace that I gave someone for Christmas. It was not quite a match as these were a bit more rose gold in color, but they were close enough. They were very pretty and worked well as a gift. I would recommend as long as you know they aren't a bright gold, but more of a rose gold color.",5,"More rose gold, but still beautiful",1397692800,"04 17, 2014",0.2074

7,A2V5Y4I54QD5C6,B0000B35EG,Mrs.T,"[0, 0]","I used to buy Duragold years ago, and was surprised and pleased to see it available here. I bought both the 4 mm and the 5 mm yellow gold ball studs. Please note the posts are shorter than normal, which I love because I can sleep in them without them poking the back of my head. The butterfly clasp is small, so I replaced them with a locking type of clasp from a different pair of earrings. I have worn the 4 mm ones in my second hole continuously for well over a month with no problem. One thing great about Duragold is that they're hypoallergenic, which is important for those who can have reactions to different alloys in gold. I really like this brand.",5,Love Duragold Jewelry,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",0.3943
8,A28TWWUAWFVCTR,B0000B35EG,Never pay retail,"[19, 20]","These are attractive gold studs. I personally would not want any larger size. The posts are very thin and the backs are tiny. I have a little trouble putting them on and worry how durable they will be. I would not wear these overnight for concern about how they would hold up tossing and turning, but for work, they are pretty and did not bother my sensative ears.",4,delicate,1179014400,"05 13, 2007",0.0928
