The problem was when you tilt your suitcases on their side to roll them, this is so short that the wheels of the attached case come off the ground. The quality of construction looked good.",2,too short,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",0.1328

I have been using this strap for a couple months now to pull both bags together and it works awesome. I wouldn't go back to traveling without it and the convenience for the price is great.I can even get both bags, when piggybacked, on an escalator and the strap is strong enough to hold the second bag in the air without snapping or anything.",5,It Works For Me,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",0.3785

The strap is well constructed, but the minimum length is too long to avoid your backpack from dragging the ground when pulling the carryon. A laptop bag or purse is fine, but not anything as vertically high as a backpack. I purchased the Travelon bungee cord for this purpose and will try it on my next trip. I'd shorten the minimum length of this thing and it would be fine. Otherwise, it will be fine with a checked bag coupled with a smaller carryon or purse/backpack. But for smaller luggage, not so much.",3,Too long for carryyon bags,1387756800,"12 23, 2013",0.0286

Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker, Black, One Size.This simple buckle and strap looks easy to use but it isn't. When you're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap, you're fussing around with it in baggage claim. The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra tongue to quickly pull on (like a backpack strap) so you can clip, pull to tighten, and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good for light loads and smaller bags. For larger ones, this one was a pain to use. You get what you pay for.

They came in very handy for stacking the bags and luggage we had to manhandle through customs, airports, into taxis & B & Bs, etc. They were very easy to use & sturdy, and I recommend every traveler carry a couple for unexpected needs (to bind more than one thing together for easy carrying). I used one every day in the rental car to hang my bags on (hung it from the head rest) so items didn't get tossed and lost.",5,Luggage Straps -- Add-A-Bag,1344038400,"08 4, 2012",0.126
15,A2H7AOXP8KUXQ1,B00004SR9P,T&J T & J,"[17, 17]","I bought two of these, and we have used them both multiple times. They are made well and the clip is heavy duty. Make sure to use it with a strong handle on your suitcase, as the design is such that it pulls significantly on the handle when carrying the second suitcase. This item is also useful to attach other items, such as on small carryons or your travel pillow. Two of these belts were VITAL to my international travel alone with a toddler and tons of suitcases/stroller/carryons/car seat, etc. They helped to strap items together for easy transport, and I was able to get through the airports with everything in tow. I highly recommend them!UPDATE FEB 2012: I have used these straps on multiple trips and they have held up well. At one point I used the strap on three suitcases at once, including a large rolling duffel bag, a large suitcase, and a medium suitcase. It kept everything together and I was able to navigate through international airports with multiple suitcases strapped together, car seat, diaper bag, backpack, and toddler (in an Ergo baby carrier). Without this strap, I don't know what I would have done! Such a little product, and so important!!!",5,Convenient and handy tool for travel,1305417600,"05 15, 2011",0.2628
