0,A1PZTLO2KKVYT7,B00007IVVR,HelloMyNameIs,"[0, 0]","These don't give me much support but I did not really expect them to. I wear a 32D and ordered a size C they covered perfectly. I feel like this may work better if you are fuller on top. I'm fuller on bottom and the tabs just pull the skin and makes me look wrinkly. They did give me some support, however they also made a strange cone shape and made me look quite pointy. I would wear these with something that already has some support or is a thicker fabric. However, they will definitely come in handy with certain outfits and would be perfect for a special occasion dress that already has some structure.",4,"Meh, not bad but not that great.",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",0.4422

They look like I have perky boobs with no bra. Be patient though. Also, they may not work so well with thin fabrics. . . makes the skin look kind of wrinkly.",5,Works well for me - 34 C,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",0.1864

They provide just enough lift, but don't expect them to make you look like you're wearing a full bra. They just reduce the jiggle and hold you in place.",5,love these things,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",0.1674

I wrote the review so you don't have too.And I only intended to wear these with a strapless bra for more support, not alone so I was not expecting too much.",1,Don't Bother,1348185600,"09 21, 2012",0.1254
