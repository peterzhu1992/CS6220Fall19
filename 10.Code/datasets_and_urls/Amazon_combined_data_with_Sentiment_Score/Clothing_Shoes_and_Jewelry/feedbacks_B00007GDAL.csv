(They do wear out after 15 years of constant use.) Buxton always makes beautiful quality leather goods. I like that the change purse closes with a metal clasp and not a zipper. I especially like that there is a divided change purse --- I use one side for pennies and the other side for all other coins. Also, I like that there are two paper money slots ---- I use one side for bills and the other side for checks. (yes I am very organized.) I like this wallet very much.",5,Beautiful wallet with many excellent features,1384128000,"11 11, 2013",0.298

The only thing I will mention is that in the cash parts, there is an opening, so you can't put loose pieces of paper or anything in there, because it might fall out. Otherwise its great, there is enough space for a bunch of cards, cash and change. The wallet can feel a little bulky when completely full but its great.",4,Beautiful wallet,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",0.5265

The only thing that I was originally looking for and this did not have it, was to have my ID in a window outside the wallet so I would not have to open it up in order to show my ID.

The problem I have is while it has many slots, it doesn't close well when the slots are all or even mostly filled. The change purse clasp pops open and so does the snap closure.

It appears the window will become unattached shortly. This unraveling is no doubt a result of having to produce ID several times a week while shopping. A simple fix would be reinforced stitching in that most used area of the wallet where wear-and-tear are greatest.",3,"It Is O.K., But...",1393545600,"02 28, 2014",0.1836

It was slightly bigger than I thought it'd be, but when I opened it up, I discovered why - slots GALORE! There are probably 20 card slots alone all over the inside of this wallet, and there are 2 large pockets and perhaps 3-4 small ones for receipts, cash, and whatever else you'd like to store inside your wallet. There is a clasped pouch on one side for your change.Overall, this wallet is extremely well-designed and very useful for those of us who constantly carry a lot of cards with us. The colors are as expected (I got the warm pink shade) and the texture is matte, smooth and durable. Plus, the price is unbeatable!

Also I love the unique change purse which is divided pennies on one side and quarters and nickles on the the other side.. Has two clasps on it.

I just got finished transferring all my life from that to the new Buxton wallet. Mind you, a wallet to me is a brief history of my life-- where I carry Catholic holy cards, my NRA life-membership card, pictures of my late husband and drivers licenses dating back 15 years.

Many other wallets have a small gusseted change section that is zippered and doesn't open far enough for you to see what change you have.
