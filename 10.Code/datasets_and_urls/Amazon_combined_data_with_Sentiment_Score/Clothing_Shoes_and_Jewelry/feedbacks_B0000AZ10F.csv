0,AP2IF001XVOO8,B0000AZ10F,H. Fussy,"[4, 4]",I was very pleased with these earrings. I wasn't too sure about the size from the description and they are a bit smaller than I would have liked.The stones are a good quality and I enjoy wearing them.,5,I feel pretty,1175212800,"03 30, 2007",0.5611
1,A2701UXI8QGRHE,B0000AZ10F,Leslie Ann Lewis,"[10, 10]","I purchased these earrings to go with another purchse, aSmoky Quartz 14k Gold-Plated Ring, and they are a perfect match!The color is beautiful and the size is perfect for daytime/work wear. They are high quality and I have received many compliments.Highly recommended.",5,Beautiful and versatile,1220400000,"09 3, 2008",0.557
2,A1OA2ZW406NQXM,B0000AZ10F,Mary S.,"[3, 3]","I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold, they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything. They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they'd be really small, but they are not. In spite of the decent size of the stones, these are really lightweight and you can't tell you're wearing them, at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I'm considering buying an additional pair, just for that purpose!",5,Beautiful Earrings! Perfect for Fall!,1222300800,"09 25, 2008",0.4423

4,A1VJS5J9RWVQ5K,B0000AZ10F,Puff n Fluff* Puff*,"[1, 1]","These earrings are smaller than I expected them to be and do not show at all in my ears. Maybe it's because my hair is brown plus their size...?The gold in them is substantial and the stones are a reasonable quality for the price. If you purchase these and prefer earrings that are femnine and delicate, you'll enjoy owning these and they are worth the price of $39",4,Nice but quite small,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",0.2836
5,A81BDRN1MOGWH,B0000AZ10F,S. Cunningham JewelySue,"[3, 3]","These are very nice stud earrings. I got them at a great sale price. They are small, not flashy, but with a good medium purple amethyst gemstone. They sit well on the ear and are comfortable. Adequate gold setting.",4,Nice for the price,1226620800,"11 14, 2008",0.5158
