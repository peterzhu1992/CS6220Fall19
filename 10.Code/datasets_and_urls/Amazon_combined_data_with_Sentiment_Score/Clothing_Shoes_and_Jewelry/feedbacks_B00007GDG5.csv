9,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,B00007GDG5,Jody,"[1, 1]","I always come back to Buxton for wallets. This one has a place for everything, and I do mean everything! I really like the currency compartment--there are two slots for bills and a center zippered compartment for coins, receipts, or large denominations. There's also a change pouch in front for easy access. There are almost enough card slots, and there are a number of plastic sleeves if you run out of slots. For some reason the slots are not of uniform size and I had to do some finagling to make some of my cards fit. I also wish the snap flap went over the currency compartment so I didn't have to keep it zipped, but I'll get used to it, and I'm sure the leather slots will loosen up with use.After an exhaustive online and in store search, I've decided that this clutch gives the best bang for the buck. Mine is red, and it's a rich, not fire engine color. I'm very pleased.",4,Buxton's the best!,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",0.3718
10,A2N64UT67J8HFM,B00007GDG5,Lorrianne1285,"[0, 0]","This clutch wallet passed my expectations, very happy with this wallet. The color and suede feel is a great plus. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great clutch wallet at a reasonable price. In similar products, other clutch book wallets would not have as much available space, for all items needed to be placed in the wallet. The size can fit into any pocketbook without the bulge when filled, a deep pocket, or used as a carry-along without pocketbook. This clutch is great, and would not be a disappointment to anyone who is looking for this type of wallet.

18,A3XNATSMROFT8,B00007GDG5,wilma hays Willy,"[0, 0]","I have had several zip around clutch wallets and it is the style I prefer. The color is not fire engine red just a nice red color. The leather is medium soft with a nice feel to it. Love all the card holding spots and the area for a check book is easily used for something else. The snap closure is handy and keeps everything in place, you can access your money without having to open the clutch, just open the zippered area. Having a zipper change pocket on the side is so handy or you can use the zipper pocket in the zip around. When all filled I still found this Buxton clutch to be fairly slim. I'm very pleased with this clutch and would buy it again.",5,LOVE MY RED WALLET,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",0.2838
