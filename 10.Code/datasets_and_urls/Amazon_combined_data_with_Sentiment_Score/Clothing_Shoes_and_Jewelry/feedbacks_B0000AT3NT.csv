2,A1XTLG2WTZV858,B0000AT3NT,G.Schmidt,"[0, 0]",The belt fit my son great. Good quality for a good price. Can be wash (be white) but needs to hang dry.,5,Son baseball,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",0.4884
3,AIALTYMQTSKY3,B0000AT3NT,Leon Alphatres,"[0, 0]",Nice belt but the buckle shows sign of rusting. I was dissapointed when I saw theinitial stage of rusting on the buckle. Decided to keep it so I do not have to hassle with shipping & handling.,3,Not bad but signs of initial rusting on the buckle.,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",0.0754
4,AEC90GPFKLAAW,B0000AT3NT,Lisa Kearns Lisa Kearns,"[0, 0]","We have at least 20 baseball belts in different sizes and colors, from our two sons' many seasons of baseball. But, we didn't have a black one in an adult size, which our older son needs now that he's bigger. I ordered this one from Amazon because I didn't have time to drive to Walmart (which usually doesn't have what we need) or Dick's (an hour away).The belt is perfect - long enough and adjustable for adult sized waists, wider than youth belts, and made of stretchy elastic. Our son's baseball team didn't give them belts with the uniform, and his first game is in three days, so I was happy to receive this one so quickly and have belt checked off my list.",5,"Perfect size, adjustable",1393459200,"02 27, 2014",0.3168
5,AN7C4K8W0U4Y2,B0000AT3NT,Monk,"[0, 0]",Not the best belt but ok for the kids. it was cheap and you get what you pay for. I'd give it a 3.5 and not a 4 but it is better than a three,4,Not the best belt but ok for the kids,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",0.2157
6,A11YOTONCPRQ9S,B0000AT3NT,P.L.,"[0, 0]",This is better than the Champion baseball belt. The color is off though. I ordered maroon and it looks brown. The buckle is also smaller than Champion's. And the overall length is longer. I don't need it that long. But what's nice is where the metal sizing clip ends up due to how long it is overall.,4,Pretty decent,1351728000,"11 1, 2012",0.1929

9,A3A3VFYITQZNRQ,B0000AT3NT,zak,"[0, 0]","I ordered maroon and was surprised at how brown it actually was. I held it up to a pair of brown pants and it basically matched. It was not a wrong product because they do not offer brown. Other than my complaint about the color, it feels like a pretty nice belt. Seems strong so far and quite durable. Good belt good price, expect a darker color.",3,"Good Belt, Wrong color.",1333411200,"04 3, 2012",0.4254
