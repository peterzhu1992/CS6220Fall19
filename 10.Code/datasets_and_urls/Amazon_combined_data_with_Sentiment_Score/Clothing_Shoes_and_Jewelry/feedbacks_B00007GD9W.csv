You get a great coin pocket with snap closure, insert for your license with removable plastic card pockets with another snap closure, plus your bill compartment. It's a great wallet for a wonderful price!!",5,Love this wallet!,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",0.4211

Now we all need so many club cards for stores you to those plus a credit card and drivers license you can barely squish your Health and Car insurance cards it it. Unless you don't have much to carry, I'd say skip it. Buxton, consider making this a little bigger to carry more and its a serious winner. Now if the banks would still make this style of checkbook It would be very convenient.",4,I liked the basic style,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",0.1848

I haven't been this impressed with a wallet since theAlicia Klein Wallet Park Avenue. This really is a fantastic wallet to have. I highly recommend getting it.,5,A Wonderful Wallet,1366070400,"04 16, 2013",0.3306
