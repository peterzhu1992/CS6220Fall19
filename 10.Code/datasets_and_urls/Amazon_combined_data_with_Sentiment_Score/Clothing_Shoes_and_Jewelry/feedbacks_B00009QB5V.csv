Next time I'll order XL. Other than that, I love the Kangaroo pouch style. For years I've worn Munsingwear's Kangaroo pouch briefs, but reviews on their latest product have not been good now that they're made in China, so I was happy to find Jockey making this style brief. I'm very happy with the quality... just should have ordered the larger size....",5,"Great briefs, but run small",1356566400,"12 27, 2012",0.2639

4,A1MXJVANURX26J,B00009QB5V,G. Wells,"[0, 0]","Comfortable, stout, quality underwear. The pocket seems to let heat rise which is handy. They nearly reach your belly button -- which makes them great choices when you don't want to tuck in your shirt (they protect your waist from rough jeans).After a month and four wash/wear cycles (hot water wash and high heat dry for super-sterilization-ish-ness) they are still going strong. :)Munslingers, my old brand, have gone down in quality (i've thrown out brand new ones -- I can't in good conscience return worn underwear); stretched out elastic, no support, too loose or too tight elastic (one leg hole might be tight, the other leg hole too loose -- really horrible situations that make 'em unwearable).I expect to buy only these Jockeys for many many years.",5,Jan 2013 - WAAAAY better than Munsinglers,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",0.1403

9,ASFNTI8NRNRR0,B00009QB5V,The OC,"[0, 0]","When I ordered this product there were 2 colors offered - white and black. Should be clear as black and white, right? But the color picture of the black shorts showed as grey which was my preference. I figured the pictured color was considered black. Drat, wrong again. The shorts arrived and are a very black black, not a grey black. Not a big complaint for me but still a little annoying. Everything else appears OK.",4,"OK, but color info was faulty",1382227200,"10 20, 2013",-0.0564
