0,A2V98YBD3SRVG9,B00005KJXN,Kinda,"[0, 0]","For the price, I think this is a fine costume. No more cheaply made than the next Halloween costume but because it's so simple, you can't really tell. It was a hit at the party I attended (I went with someone dressed in a priest costume made by the same company - great couples' idea)! It would earn an extra star if it came with the cross. I had to buy one for another ten bucks at the last minute.",4,Great for the cost!,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",0.169
