0,A3PIDQJQK13YMJ,B0000ANC7S,B W Parker,"[1, 1]","If you are looking for the Reeboks that were made in the 80's and 90's, this is not it. The first pair I ordered in the size I have worn for decades was too short and way too tight thru the toe area. Ordered a half a size larger and they were still tight thru the toe area and the heel area is too large, but the length was right. I had to use inserts in the heels and put them in a stretcher to make the toe area comfortable. Will not be ordering these shoes anymore.",2,NOT THE SAME OLD STYLE REEBOK,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",0.0429

So, went to trusty Amazon.com and found them with ease. These are the only shoes I can wear that don't hurt my feet and that have good ankle support. The fit is great, they don't wear out.

7,A2ZGHESQDCI77M,B0000ANC7S,Shiloh True Rabid Reader,"[1, 2]","I had a pair of Reebok Hi-Top sneakers years ago and wore them to threads. I hadn't seen any locally and had basically given up, until stumbling upon them on Amazon. I was delighted to get another pair.I remembered, and I'm glad I did, that these shoes run on the small and narrow side. I normally wear a size 9, but went up a half size to 9.5. And, they fit perfectly, with room for a light, gel type orthopedic insert, which I think is necessary because the footbed is not very cushioned. There is moderate arch support.I know many younger folks like Hi-Tops as a fashion statement. I really like them for the ankle support, particularly with this shoe because the double velcro straps provide for necessary adjustments for perfect comfort.These shoes are a blast from the past. I may have to spring for a pair in black for the upcoming fall/winter.",4,"Glad to find these, again",1375228800,"07 31, 2013",0.3627
8,A2MJ0B3PBH8AL1,B0000ANC7S,SJones Eclectic individual,"[0, 0]","I use to love these in the '80's but hi-tops became obsolete. Glad I could find some because in the hot summer I hate wearing my ankle braces as they make my feet sweat too much and constrict my blood flow making my feet and ankles swell. Anyway, although I haven't worn these out of the house yet, I'm sure they will work well for me provided I still use my cane. I will admit in reading the other reviews, they do run narrow which was fine with me and the length was perfect. Nicely made too.",5,I think I will be able to ditch the ankle braces,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",0.3202

10,A22WPPH9H54JL,B0000ANC7S,Victoria,"[11, 11]","I have weak ankles, and decided that I needed to wear high top sneakers to give me some support. Years ago, I wore Reeboks exclusively, in many different styles, and never had any problems with sizing. I had read some of the reviews that noted that the shoes ran narrow, but I figured that I would try them anyhow.The shoes arrived yesterday. I liked the sneaker, and the way that they were made. Problem was, that after just one look, I knew that they were not for me. They weren't a little narrow, but so narrow that it was obvious, to the naked eye, that these sneakers would not fit. I tried one on, and was just about able to squeeze my foot into them. Walk in them, forget it.There way no way that I could wear them. Some people had suggested buying a larger size, but I was afraid that it would not work. They still would be narrow, and too long.I have looked all over the internet, for a basic, white hightop, at a reasonable price. Apparently anything that I have seen are either very expensive, or come in garish colors only. Any suggestions?",2,"Nice Shoe, but For Skinny Feet Only",1360886400,"02 15, 2013",-0.0325
