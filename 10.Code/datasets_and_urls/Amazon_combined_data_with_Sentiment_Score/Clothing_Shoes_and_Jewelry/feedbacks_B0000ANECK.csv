I like a bit of extra room in my shirts for freedom of movement, especially long sleeve shirts. In a cotton shirt I usually buy a large knowing it will shrink down a bit with washing and drying. A lot of the other reviews indicated the sizes ran a little large so I ordered a medium.A medium ran true to size and certainly was not larger than normal. So I returned for a large and it was the perfect size for me- before washing/drying. I removed from the dryer while still slightly damp on the heavier material sections and it still shrunk some, about 1/2 of a size.For reference, my heather gray colored shirt was made in the Domican Republic and is 90% cotton and 10% polyester.
