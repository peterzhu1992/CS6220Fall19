It worked very good at flattening my big chest making it impossible for the big huge sacks I call breast to even budge one centimeter.The downfalls of this bra is that it is hard to put on the first time and really does not break in and feel comfortable and natural until you have worn the thing many times. Also it took time to put the bra on as it has over 10 hooks to fasten painstakingly one at a time.However, the positive is that I had this same model bra for over 2 years and has survived constant wear, tear, and abuse.To sum up this review it is worth the money if you are up to enduring some discomfort until the bra breaks in and is looking for an excellent minimizer.AS for an actual sports bra for activities where you will be doing alot of moving and flexing of the upper body I do not recommend this bra.

I like fastening it in the front instead of the back, but there are quite a few hooks that can be tedious to fix up each time. I was disappointed in the efficacy of the bra for vigorous activity. This was my last stop in my tour of expensive sports bras that the interwebs say are best for ladies with large breasts, and I was hoping that it would blow the competition out of the water. It didn't. It's playing nicely with the other bras in the water.

I have tried numerous other (very expensive) sports bras, but none has provided the level of support AND comfort that the Enell does. Now, I have no problem with the fact that there are no strap adjustments, but apparently some women find the straps are too short/long for them. It fits me perfectly and I have changed sizes over the years. Be sure to take the time to measure your rib cage (below the breast) and across your breasts to determine the correct size to order. The basic calculation is breast size (let's say a 40) minus rib cage size (say 34) equals your cup size (40-34 = 6). Count the alphabet to 6 letters (in our example, F) and that's your cup size. Many products use double and triple D, so an F = DDD as well. As anyone with large breasts knows, it can be difficult to get excited about exercise when every bounce hurts, but exercise is SO important for our physical and mental health.

I am a competitive, thin, fit 44 yo with 34F busts so over the years certain body parts have moved a bit southward and there is a lot of postential for jiggling to outright flopping. In this Enell Sport Bra I can run and jump with no unwanted movement. It is a compreesion bra, so you are going to have a mono-boob, but it is the only bra I can run in that does the job without chafing. And when I am working out hard I'm a make-upless, hair-puled-back, sweaty mess, so what do I care if I have one compressed motionless boob?Most of the negative reviews of this bra are folks who couldn't get into it, so I figured I wuld tell you the easiest way:1. First put your arms through the arm holes as though you were putting on a vest.2. Leave your boobs where they are: if they are down by your lower rib cage, your belly button or tucked into your waistband, just leave there.3. Grasp your Enell Sports Bra by the bottom two front clasps and lift up (vertically) so you are NOT pulling it across your boobs, but over the top of your boobs across your chest at arm pit height.4. Hook the bottom to clasps so that the bra is closed at the bottom but contains no boobs.5. Using your right hand, go through the inside of the bra and scoop up your left boob and pull it ino the bra. Do the same with your left hand, right boob.6. Arrange your boobs so they are comfortable and facing the same direction, then easiely hook the rest of the clasps from the bottom up.Ta-Da!I will say this is a LOT of bra. If you are a cup size C or smaller this may not be the bra for you. If you do not do a lot of high impact movements (running, jumping, karate, burpees, pogo-sticking) you probably do not need a bra this sturdy. For example, I do not need to wear my Enell when I am weight training or biking. However, if you are an older lady who maybe has had a couple of kids and gravity has done its thing, this may be the bra for you; or if you are a younger gal who is well endowed and have seen your mother naked and don't want the same fate to befall you, then you may want to wear a Enell to ward off the horrors of gravity for as long as possible.",5,How to get into your Enell Sports Bra,1356393600,"12 25, 2012",0.1314

(42 bust and 37 rib cage) The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage, but I thought I'd need a 2 to really compress everything. I'm glad I went with the 3, because if it were any tighter, and it would probably hurt my rib cage. As it is, it seems just right.When I first put it on, I thought it wouldn't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part, but it works! There's still some movement, but it doesn't hurt at all, and I don't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me. In fact, I hardly feel constricted at all, other than in the band around my rib cage, and that part isn't uncomfortable at all. The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says--they minimize bounce. I did several jumping jacks without a problem. It's really hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you're wearing body armor, and under a shirt it definitely doesn't look like you're wearing a normal bra. But I think it looks fine. It just flattens you, and depending on the fabric you're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support. Turbo Kick and the elliptical trainer aren't places to have fashion shows, anyway, though, so I'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper, OneSweetOne, was also fast. I ordered on a Wednesday, got it on a Tuesday--one day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012. I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great!

I remember walking at the track with a friend and trying to jog a bit during the straight stretches...only to have her comment that I really needed to wear a sportsbra to minimize all the bounce. She was shocked when I told her that I actually had two on. Since a pretty dramatic weight gain, the bounce has gotten worse. When I found out my job was sponsoring free zumba classes, I couldn't wait to enroll but felt self-conscious...plus jumping around without good support is very uncomfortable. So when I saw the Enell bra featured on a plus sized fashion blog (with rave reviews), I went ahead and splurged. I have to say that I'm very pleased. The bra compresses but it also provides a lot of lift from below. I feel supported AND lifted instead of just getting squash-chest like the other bras out there. And for the first time since I hit puberty I was able to go for a light jog without feeling like I was pulling a pectoral muscle. Also, because of the unique satin-like material (versus the traditional all-cotton sportsbras), my shirts don't ride up or get stuck on my chest like velcro.Still, I couldn't quite give it a perfect 5-star rating. For one thing, I'm still getting a little bit of a uni-boob. The band fits perfect but the cup size seems a tad small, but I don't want to go up a size and risk not getting a good fit around...speaking of which, it is a bit of an non-traditional fit. The shoulder straps are pretty short and sort of has the bra hiked up in the back...really high. Also, the price makes this a luxury item.
