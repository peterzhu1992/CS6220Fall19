I wear an 8.5 shoe and I fell between the S and M. Neither fit just right. Wish they made more sizes",2,Need more Sizes,1384560000,"11 16, 2013",0.3459

The heel is the only part that wears down at all, but it takes a really long time. I probably wore my first pair of these for 14 months daily (over 4 years).",5,Wouldn't buy anything else,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",0.1112
4,A1OY5B228QZ608,B0000ANAKR,Hussein,"[0, 0]","Easily my favorite sandals I've ever owned. I've had them for almost three years now, and I still wear them and they haven't worn out yet. I would definitely buy them again. The only thing you need to know is that those run a little smaller than usual. My shoes size usually is a 10.5-11 depending on the brand and the 9.5-10.5 fits perfectly. It was a little hard to get used to it in the beginning since it molds to one's feet, but as soon as that happened, it was the most comfortable pair of sandals I've ever owned!",5,Great Sandals,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",0.4419

6,A3FPSY1M6G7XIB,B0000ANAKR,RonAnnArbor,"[4, 15]","HEre's the thing....everyone says these sandals need a break-in period --- a) that's ridiculous, and b) they absolutely DO NOT fit a wide foot (E, EEE, or EEEEE). These are soft leather, nice looking and for a thin foot probably very comfortable. I wear a 7.5 EEE. I ordered one size larger (8.5 - 9.5 MEdium) and they absolutely DO NOT fit -- while you can get your foot into the strap, they cut into the skin between the toes, and there is absolutely no way to break in the sandle....I wore them for about an hour and found that a) not only do they not loosen up in any way they also dug into the top of my foot and created bloody welts. These 50.00 sandals became unreturnable because they have been worn, and they have dirt on them, and they have blood on the straps.$50.00 worth of garbage within one hour. DO NOT BELIEVE all these folks on here who say just break them in....they do not fit a wide foot, period. Save your money.",1,Absolutely do not fit a wide foot,1334275200,"04 13, 2012",-0.1076
7,A2SWABP7DAWANH,B0000ANAKR,SandyEggo727,"[0, 0]","These sandals last longer than any I've ever owned, which is why I keep buying them. The leather is soft and pliable and molds to your feet after about 10-15 wears. They survive through water and sand and heat and sun.

8,A1M1KPAGGXP2JI,B0000ANAKR,Seaguy99 Treasure2,"[0, 0]","So I lusted after Rainbows for about 7 years before I decided they might be worth the money.-I got a large (I wear 9.5M) and my foot went right to the edge, so I got an extra-large.-The wear in period wasn't so bad, I did get a blister as expected.-My largest problem is that the foot surface area got so smooth that my foot kep sliding in and out of the shoe, and it dried out and rubbed up against my foot. I feel like it was polishing the bottom of my foot.-I feel like they are going to fall off when I walk-I thought there was going to be a bit more arch support.-The bottom is very hard.All in all they are good looking sandals, but I've tried on a friend's REEFs and they were incredibly comfortable. If I could go back in time, I would have gone with the REEFs.",2,Should have gone with Reefs,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",0.4239
