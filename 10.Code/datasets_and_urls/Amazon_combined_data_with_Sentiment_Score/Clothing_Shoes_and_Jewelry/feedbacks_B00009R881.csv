0,A1FHUYGO3OWWRF,B00009R881,A photographer,"[65, 68]","I used Domke bags several years ago when I worked as a news photographer. The design was/is one of the best around for a bag to work out of rather than just to carry equipment. I liked the bag for its floppiness and its ability to mold itself to your body when carried. The biggest problem with the bags--and I saw this in virtually every Domke bag being carried by news photographers at the time--was that they wore through due to friction. Carrying it every day meant it rubbed against your side and mine eventually wore a big hole in the back. The only other problem I had with the bag was the lack of weather proofing. Being cotton, when they got wet they stayed wet for a long time.I switched to a waterproofed nylon bag but it had its own problems. Zippers wore out and the rough nylon rubbed against and wore spots on my jackets.Bottom line is--there is no perfect camera bag. The best I've found has been the Billingham brand (those are 5-star bags). They are dense-weave cotton with a waterproofing applied. They don't wear as easily and they don't absorb water. They're as easy to work out of as a Domke. They cost a LOT more, however.I like the Domke bags as a less expensive alternative to the Billinghams. I still like to transport equipment in heavily padded, waterproof nylon bags but, more often than not, I'll carry a Domke or Billingham canvas bag when I'm actually shooting photos.",4,It's not perfect but it's a good choice,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",0.0475

Lots of handy little pockets to hold manuals or filters or battery chargers. Perfect to keep everything together in one place.,5,Really well designed and versatile bag,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",0.2928
2,A3PPO2X5PJE1L9,B00009R881,Gene Bowker Rusted Rail Images,"[1, 1]","My Domke F-2 arrived yesterday along with the extra padded internal compartment.I decided against the waxed leather because of the reviews where people said that the wax would rub off and instead went with Olive Drab.I moved my outfit into the bag and found that it could hold more than I expected, but of course a lot less than my much larger backpack.The Canon 5D Mark III fits with either the 50mm f/1.4 or the 20-35mm F/2.8L mounted. The 70-200mm f/2.8L IS will just fit in the compartment with the lenshood reversed. However, the mounting end sticks up a little more than I would really like. The biggest thing I noticed was a lack of padding in the top flap, I can feel the endcap on the 70-200 through it. There is a zippered inside pocket on the flap, so I'll probably insert a piece of thinsulite or thin foam in it to give it just a little more padding on top as a comfortI fit the above lenses, the 2x teleconverter, 430EXii Flash, and accessories inside the main compartment. It's snug, but workable. If I need more than that, I'd probably carry the full size backpack instead (even with the extra weight)I like the well made clips, backed up with a large velcro closure. While the velcro is not silent for street shooting, the combination will help to make sure that the bag stays closed.The strap is nice and wide, fully adjustable and goes all the way under the bag for extra strength. There are two large end pockets big enough to carry accessories. Fully loaded, it is heavy, but manageable.Since I didn't get the waxed leather, I plan on spraying it down with some Kiwi Campdry or ScotchGuard to give it a little water repellancy on the outside.After the next few weeks of trips I'll update",4,Fits more than you think and only one concern.,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",0.2652
3,A275EOYAIDKYAU,B00009R881,Jimh615,"[7, 11]","3 Stars for a beautiful bag. It is exactly what I wanted. However, I thought the partitians would be fully adjustable...they are not. The only interior layout this bag has is a four-part partition quadrant held in place by velcro. If you remove the partition, it's just an empty space with no partitians.The quadrant partitian is moveable left and right from extreme side to side. However, the partitians inside the quadrant itself are not adjustable. You cannot adjust the sizes of the four partitians inside this moveable quadrant which is the only partitian system in this bag.I could not fit my Canon EF 100-400 L IS into any of the equally sized partitians inside the quadrant. I could have moved the quadrant all the way to one side, but then the slot would have been too large for the lens and would have left no place for my Canon 30D. The fixed partitian quadrant takes up over 2/3rds of the interior of the bag.Taking the quadrant partitian out, leaves you an empty cavity necessitating using the cases your lens came in....unless you're ok with them just rattling around in there.If you have small, thin lenses...this might work.....but there is no customizing of the interior partitian arrangement.If this bag had moveable, individually adjustable partitian panels, it would be wonderful. With only one non-adjusting quadrant....it was not acceptable.A very minor point: I didn't like the clips on the front holding the top flap down, two of them, are very small. The clips need to be updated with either larger ones or the plastic type used by many bag manufacturers.....retro is nice, but a little updating is also good.Thank you Amazon for standing behind your sales; I returned the bag.",3,Not very Versatile,1213056000,"06 10, 2008",0.0833
4,A314SSFZKE4FVN,B00009R881,J. Skilton,"[8, 8]","I've never seen a modestly sized bag hold so much stuff, comfortably. I have a couple larger bags that -technically- hold more, but in some weird configuration so that I'm always packing and unpacking. Domke bags are designed by a photographer for photographers, and it shows. I started filling this bag, and just 'knew' where to put everything - and I don't have to remove more than one item to get to whatever I need. Comes out of the box looking a bit 'lived in', and not obviously a camera bag, which is a plus when traveling. The metal clips that back up the velcro top closure could be easier to manipulate, but -- great bag!",5,Great Bag !,1154131200,"07 29, 2006",0.1764
5,A30RFVDF33XJAO,B00009R881,Kenn Alan,"[0, 0]","I like the style. it's water repellant and it is a no-frills bag. I don't need all of that extra foam. I may need to whop somebody with my bag full of lenses someday and I want it to count, should the opportunity dictate such a defensive action.It holds everything I need for specific assignments.It's made in the USA too!",5,Good bag,1403827200,"06 27, 2014",0.2256

I'm trying to get back in the business again, and feel the F 2 is the way to go. It gives me plenty of room for camera and lenses plus my flash. I dig the look of the sand bag, and the straps work great. I really like Domke products, and will never switch again.",5,Great Bag,1278201600,"07 4, 2010",0.1364
7,AFICF7DKHTQ87,B00009R881,tabby,"[4, 4]","I've got this bag 2 months back. It currently fits a Nikon d300, 17-55, 70-200, Sigma 10-20, Nikon 50mm f1.8, sb400, extra battery, couple lens filters.Pros:-construction. This bag is built very well. Material used seems of high quality, and the stitching is excellent. I really like the straps mechanism, as they feel very secure. The main strap also has some kind of rubbery strips on them, which helps keep the strap from sliding off your shoulder (and have your thousands of dollars come crashing on the ground)There is also a smaller hand strap, as opposed to the main sling strap, which is very convenient for helping you precisely lift the bag and place it, which I really like)-discreetness. This bag doesn't look like a typical photography bag, but rather just a standard sling bag. Makes me more comfortable when carrying it though airports, or places that I am not familiar with.-comfort. This bag is very comfortable to carry, even fully loaded, for hours. Because of the canvas nature of the bag, it molds to your body (assuming you pick it right), which makes it feel more secure at your side.Cons.-padding. This bag does not have too much padding, (it comes with a 4 compartment padding sleeve, which i have converted to a 2+1+1 padding sleeve, to fit my 70-200 lying at an angle), and no padding at all on the top. I think the padding is adequate, but probably could be improved.-price. Compared to other equivalent photo bags, this bag seems a little pricey.-weather proofing. This bag does not come with a waterproof cover, though, from what I read from other review, it is pretty waterproof, however, in pouring rain, I'm pretty sure that it will drench through. (not quire sure what you would be doing in pouring rain with your equipment). This can be fixed by packing a large garbage bag with you all the time, tacky but works.All in all, this is a very nice photographer's bag. Highly recommended.",5,ramblines from a DSLR newbie...,1202515200,"02 9, 2008",0.2965
