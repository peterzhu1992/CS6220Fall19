It has good to combat twice, multiple airborne jumps, and EVERYTHING! I had to replace the band once during this time (loctite my friends, loctite) and the battery just a few times. I am going back to Afghanistan in a few months and considered getting another Suunto, the Core, however, the reviews seemed pretty bad so I decided to get a new battery and keep the Vector. When I was stationed with the Special Forces, this watch was an issued time piece, and EVERYONE got one who was deploying to Afghanistan back then. I wasn't deploying at that time, so I purchased mine since everyone else had one. The face is large (52mm) and a majority of the painted numbers have rubbed off, however, the watch has never failed me. I seldom use the Compass or other functions, but when I did, they where dead on. Actually, one time flying on a mission I compared my ATLI reading with the planes instruments and it was dead on. Also, when I used the Compass for radio antenna set up, it was dead on as well. Actually, when doing land navigation testing, these watches aren't allowed because you have an advantage. In all, I have considered getting other Sports watches but this one has yet to let me down. When it does, I will stick with the Suunto Vector due to the lackluster reviews of the Suunto Core. The price has gone up since 2005, in which I paid $150.00 via an eBay sale, those days are apparently long gone. I've gone swiming, and even light diving and had no issues. The alarm works well, and the computer does all the fuzzy math so you don't have to worry about shorter months, leap years, blah blah blah. A solid product. If you know someone who is in the military have them purchase it for you because they are cheaper on military bases.My only advice would be to get some loctite to reinforce the screws. You can take it to a locale jewler and they can perform this service for you, likely for free.",5,Purchased in 2005...STILL GOING STRONG!!!!,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",-0.0129

2,A1CHOKV10NEI8X,B000051SEN,E. M. Van Court Van,"[16, 17]","This may be the 'outdoorsy' ubergeek watch. It's big, it's ugly, but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy. Overall, I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are.The timepiece: Outstanding. It has HH:MM:SS DD:MMM, of course, with a year setting to avoid leap year issues. This should go without saying in a modern digital watch. Stopwatch with lap function (not that I ever use the lap function, but I'm sure someone is interested). Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown (very easy to set). Three daily alarms. Special kudos for the alarms, this is one of the loudest watch alarms I've heard, and I've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this.The Altimeter: largely eye candy, but kind of neat. Over four days, my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level (by the maps, about 40m ASL). Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer, and I never recalibrated it, but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it.The Barometer: Yup, it's a barometer. The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend, especially as this is always active (even in normal 'time' mode).The Thermometer: Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist.The compass: Easily the best 'special' feature. Accurate, precise (enough for orienteering, not for surveying), easy to use. It can be programmed for a declination, but knowing me, I'd forget to reset it, so I do declination the hard way. The sighting notches are small but servicable. The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto, and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass. An outstanding wrist compass.The package: Big. Really, really big. But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing (a problem for me with other watches). The battery has a shortish (12-18 month) life, but has a hatch, so you don't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance. The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground, and the display light is just right, readible, even, and glare free, but not an emergency flashlight. Personally, I'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap, but the stock strap isn't bad, just not great.Overall, not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch, compass and barometer, and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter. Well designed, thought-out, and manufactured, but really big.",4,"It's HUGE! But, pretty darn cool",1143936000,"04 2, 2006",0.2171
3,AOUBIY0S651IU,B000051SEN,Gino,"[0, 0]","It does everything I need a watch to do and it looks good too. I have several of these watches in different colors, and since the battery is so easy to change I do it myself. which saves money.",5,Super Good Watch,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",0.3394
4,A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B000051SEN,Jeff Edwards RadioJeff,"[6, 7]","To my way of thinking, there are only TWO factors which keep the Vector from receiving a full 5-stars here. #1 is the watch face. It is not very durable. It isn't even glass. It's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic. I own several watches, and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat, but this one takes it to a whole new level. I'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode.#2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters (ie 300 feet) this watch isn't...FAR from it. You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower. The humidity alone may cause problems. Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool cannot honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now, with that said, if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can, the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas. It'll tell you the temperature (under the right circumstances, of course), help you predict the weather, give you a bearing on where you need to go and then (after proper adjusting) tell you your altitude. I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh, and those reviews I have read on-and-off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do, and it's limitations, I believe that the price is a bit high (you can buy a Casio watch that'll do the same thing--and is solar-powered, AND is REALLY water-resistent, all for LESS) but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches, or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with: that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings. If Casio add's one to their model, I'll probably become a full-time convert. If you are looking for something similar, but smaller, try looking at the Suunto Observer. It's a dang-good-looking watch, but the price is considerably more, so that may be a rather important factor for you (I know it is for me).All in all, Suunto makes great products, but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them (unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use).",4,"Great watch that, despite promises, is NOT waterproof to 100m.",1175558400,"04 3, 2007",0.0531

Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but, I still get a lot of comments about the watch. The altimeter (incl the memory function) worked very well. Battery replacement is easy (and has to occur about once a year). The watch is a typical ABC watch, that looks good and does the job.",4,Must have in Afghanistan,1353628800,"11 23, 2012",0.1938
6,A22E1XRKAQ2ZPP,B000051SEN,Kenyon,"[0, 0]",Amazing watch which I use on a daily basis. The time is large and is easily read and the date is just below that which is very useful in my job. The altimeter and barometer work great once they are calibrated correctly. Easy to use watch with three alarms that can be set quickly. The watch fits well and is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.,5,Amazing Watch,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",0.5567
