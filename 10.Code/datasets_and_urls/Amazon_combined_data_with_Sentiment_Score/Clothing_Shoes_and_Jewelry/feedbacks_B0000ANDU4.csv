Every semi-feral hobo kid seems to have these, or the overalls, or the double-fronted ones in black (to hide the dirt.) I wear them because they're the hardest-wearing, most comfortable work pants for the money, very close to the gold standard (Duluth Trading Company edges them out on quality by half a notch, but their stuff costs more.)Not only do the pants last longer than the GAP and Dockers pants, they also meet most peoples' contemporary standards of casual attire, and don't look out of place with a polo or Oxford shirt. Once broken-in, they're quite comfortable, with a loose but not baggy cut that can fit over a pair of long johns without chafing in cold weather. They've made jeans obsolete in my wardrobe, being tougher and much better-looking street clothes.

6,A36HBGDEFPWD0U,B0000ANDU4,Brett,"[1, 1]","These pants come so close to being perfect! The fit and color were accurate and true to amazon's descriptions. They are stiff at first, almost like wearing a new burlap bag. A few washes later and they're getting much better. If you leave them in the dryer they will dry pretty wrinkled and in the wrinkle's creases it leaves faint white marks. I have no idea what these are, but they are unsightly. They also come with a slight boot cut which makes them fit perfectly until it gets to the knee, they it looks baggy. My biggest complaint is lack of security in the pockets. Aren't these suppose to be for rugged carpenters and outdoorsmens? None of the pockets have any buttons or even velcro. I spend a nervous day in downtown New York City constantly feeling my pockets to make sure my wallet and phone hadn't slipped out. Other than that, I love them. They are constructed like Fort Knox.

Looks like more people are having this problem, likely has something to do with the quality control of their new outsourced plant. Won't be buying these off Amazon anymore, seeing as the size is basically a complete guess. Would recommend buying them in store where you can try on the pants first to make sure they fit.

I also am a teacher, so I need pants that will look good for me in school. These pants sure are just right for outdoor work and school. What I like is the back pockets are nice and large. My over-sized wallet fits perfectly. The front pockets are big enough and sturdy enough to hold everything you want to put inside. The other benefit is that since they are work dungarees, the pockets are designed to carry all sorts of items in them without getting holes in them.I am a physically larger person and these pants actually make me look good. They fit really well. The best part is that when you bend, stretch, or pick up something you aren't going to have a blow out on the side of the pants or in the crotch area. I just wish I had purchased these about ten years ago. There are also added side pockets for tools or whatever you want. The material is great and also the pants fit a bit loose, which I like. The material doesn't chafe you, but you can tell it can stand up to wear and tear. If you are a hard-on-clothing sort of person, then buy these pants.

I'm on the heavy side and find these are very roomy.
