0,A3FHSLWEMH7JD8,6301977173,Elizabeth G. Melillo gloriana,"[15, 26]","This film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent, delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of Samuel Clemens's classic.As one example, the book has great fun with the scenes involving Aunt Polly, a simple minded soul who thinks herself quite clever, and the genuinely shrewd Tom, who plays on catering to Polly's illusions about her own wit. This is a far cry from beautiful, intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty, clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot; his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school, classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of chalk squeaking on a blackboard. His rendition of &quot;If I Were God&quot; (aside from its text having nothing to do with the story - Tom's only church interests are in time to play with his pinch bug) is pure purgatory for the listener.",2,The best of Mark Twain's work - left out!,958089600,"05 12, 2000",0.3148

After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins). And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel. Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri. An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm). And he is quite the handful. He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East). He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery. He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him. And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster). But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic. Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going. Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale. The scenery and costumes recreate the times well. And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing. They weren't bad, but they weren't good either. They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story. I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it. It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed. And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie. So if you are looking for a fun version of the classic tale, you can do much worse than this one.",4,Take a Gander as Tom Sawyer Sings,1210032000,"05 6, 2008",0.162

The DVD was not in this format, it was standard Pan and Scan, and it was a poor quality transfer from the film. I thought about returning it, but decided to give it as a gift. Motion Pictures that are filmed in anamorphic, or 2.35 to 1 format should only be transfered to a DVD in this format. The people that make the decision to use pan and scan to fill a standard television are ill advised, and poorly educated to artistic principles.",1,False advertising on this DVD,1126396800,"09 11, 2005",-0.0213

It was also presented in 70mm on that huge Radio City screen. I remember how impressed i was with that opening scene with the steam boat going down the river and you see Tom running thru the field and the music builds more and more. Wow,,,,what a great movie!I've seen many versions of &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; but this one seems to be the best ever brought to the screen. Maybe because it's a musical. Whatever made this so successful back then you will not be disappointed by it's gradure and scope. A must for ever American kid and adult too. This is as red, white and blue as it gets and now must be the most politically incorrect movie ever made. (hehe) Buy it before some group puts a ban on it. Which should want you to buy this for the kids even more. They don't make them like this anymore.",5,The best Tom Sawyer i ever saw.,1030320000,"08 26, 2002",0.1745

Charming performances by then child actors Johnny Whitaker (Tom) and Jodie Foster (Becky Thatcher) and Academy-Award-winner Celeste Holm as Aunt Polly. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I rented it for my granddaughter's school project and wound up watching it 3 times. It took me back to my childhood of playing with the children next door in a more neighborly world.Highly recommended.",5,Wholesome and Entertaining bit of Nostgalgia,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",0.2626
