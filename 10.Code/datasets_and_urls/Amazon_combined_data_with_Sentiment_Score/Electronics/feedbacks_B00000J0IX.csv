1,A3DH74L21G9QFJ,B00000J0IX,F. Ehorn,"[3, 3]","Having spent 2 hours with the Magellan 315 on a camping weekend in Arizona's mountains, I can say that the unit is all that's advertised. The manual is cryptic, but once you get used to the customizing menus and 9 available navigation screens, the rest is pretty intuitive. I was able to create a waypoint, walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet. It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest. It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint (with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website)! As long as you keep moving, the compass feature is quite good. It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.Nice screen, plenty of options and quite accurate. When used in your car, it tracks your speed to .1 mph, with updates given each second. If you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover, this is a nice addition. I suspect on an open lake, this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots.",4,a must have toy,991267200,"05 31, 2001",0.2658

By the time i find the place im trying to get ive passed it and gone another 20 miles. Also, mine was working fine when suddenly one day i turned it on and it said it had no maps and i needed a upload. So i downloaded the latest patch for it, and tried uploading with no success. I have gotten a number from Magellan to return it, but lost the number (actually my dad did) So im returning it :( but i must say it was great while it worked, and the tech support is fast and reliable.",5,"Great Product, possible faulty memory card",1028764800,"08 8, 2002",-0.1267
3,A1Q587F0FDB3EV,B00000J0IX,R. Newberry Ronnnew,"[5, 5]","This is my first GPS unit and I could not be more pleased. It is simple to use and easy to carry. I have used it to mark Civil War battle sites and to find bench marks. It takes me right to the bench marks. If you are looking for a good unit, the 315 is the one you are looking for.",5,Great device,1052956800,"05 15, 2003",-0.0527

5,A2OMVQGC33VSNC,B00000J0IX,W. A. Freeman Jr.,"[121, 127]","I purchased the GPS 315 in December after using another brand for five years. The GPS315 represents a big improvement with better, quicker satelite acquistion, a compass screen that is ingenious allowing the user to use the sun or moon to correct bearing. This way the user is not having to pull out a compass to check bearing. Additional pluses are its small size and light weight using only two AA batteries lasting up to 15 hours. If weight is a concern, that is big. My previous unit used four and lasted five hours. Problems: The manual is as sorry as it can get. It barely covers TrackRoute, Track History, Backtrack, and Reverse Route. These are major important features left to the user to figure out. I have yet to figure them out consistently. With Track History there seems to be an ability to set a scale, but what scale? Nothing tells me. Is it how often it records a waypoint in history?I have emailed the company with questions twice, called once (had to leave a voice mail because they were not taking calls), faxed once. Heard nothing from their customer no-service. I wrote them yesterday to give them my thoughts. Oh yes, my GPS 315 crashed and had to be replaced last week after it was three weeks old. Glad I wasn't in the middle of 40,000 acres. You can't zoom in on a waypoint if it is very far away from your current location. Actually to do so but you have to set a scale of .1 or .2 and Pan &amp; Scan to it. If is is 50 miles away, you can imagine how long that could take.",3,GPS 315 good but has big problems,948153600,"01 18, 2000",0.0748
