I just wish I would have bought the 64gb instead of going cheap on the 32gb, but so far so good. He's a couple of months into using his camera with this card and no issues.",5,Works Great,1391299200,"02 2, 2014",0.3815
1,A3UURD9IGGUGW9,9966569863,Allen E. Unruh,"[0, 0]",Purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig. Got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare Amazon first. Haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait. Was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price.,5,Great Value,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",0.2076
