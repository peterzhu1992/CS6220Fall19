But this is still a great way to couple audiobooks and music from my smart phone to the sound system in my ancient crate. Works way better than any FM transmitter I've ever tried (although I admit I gave up after the first one or two). And the quality of this Maxell unit is at least as good as anything else I've come up with the last few years, particularly for the price. The heads look well made (I've seen others that were downright crude) and the mechanism is quiet after six months' use. Sound quality is certainly good enough, although my car is noisy enough that it's not a big issue. I can't discern any difference between what comes through this adapter and sound off CDs in the factory player, so it's sure good enough for me. I'm not an audiophile, but if I was I wouldn't be messing with cassette adapters!",5,"Quiet, cheap, does the job",1339804800,"06 16, 2012",0.4181
2,A1KAERT0MPBZOO,B000001OM4,Arnim Zola,"[1, 1]","How do audio cassettes load in your car's cassette deck? Do you insert them with the narrow side or the wide side? The problem is that most cassette adaptors can't accommodate both types of cassette decks.With this Maxell adaptor, that isn't a problem. The great thing about this cassette adaptor is that the audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side meaning no compatibility issues.NOTES-----------If you're not hearing anything, try switching the audio cable to exit the cassette adaptor on the opposite side. In my Rav4, cassettes load by inserting the narrow end. But since I didn't hear any audio, I thought this adaptor was broken. It turned out that if I made the audio cable exit on the *other* narrow end of the cassette, then there was no problem.Also try increasing the output volume of your iPod.TESTED WITH :------------A 2001 RAV4 and an iPod 30 gig and also an iPod Touch.

The sound quality is good, although you can hear some typical cassette noise at higher volumes. The cassette adapter itself is fairly quiet as well. In cold weather, it sometimes sticks a bit. But overall, it has worked quite well. I don't leave my mp3 player in the car, so the stereo cable saw quite a bit of abuse from daily bouts of plugging and unplugging.

I have found that the sound quality varies from podcast to podcast due to the level of compression used. Generally I turn my BlackBerry up to full volume and almost do the same in my car stereo. The sound quality is ok - it is a cassette after all. The cord is not very thick so you need to be careful not to snap it or pull on it roughly. I might try another adapter to see if there is any difference in sound quality.Also, the Dolby noise reduction is a must, otherwise you will get a lot of hissing.

That one worked great until my car (Acura TL) decided to start doing the auto-reverse deal and constantly spit it out. Being the cheapo that I am, I wanted to find another tape adapter instead of getting an audio input installed in my car, and I was hopeful when I saw the reviews on this adapter. However, this product constantly clicks, and loud enough to distract me from the music playing. Also the quality on this adapter is much worse than my 15-year old sony adapter. There's a lot of white noise, and I have to crank up the volume on both my ipod and my car speakers to get it to a volume where I can actually hear the lyrics of the songs. I've tried fiddling with the wire, moving it in different positions, and pulling the wire straight, but it doesn't help. I've rendered the adapter pretty much useless, and for now am stuck listening to the radio until I decide to suck it up and stop being cheap about installing an audio jack in my car.",1,"Constant clicking, sound quality not very good",1297209600,"02 9, 2011",-0.0603

I had a couple ones from Radio Shack before this one that didn't hold up for very long, and broke after a short while. The problem area with other one is where the cord connects to the tape and on the other end of the cord where it connects to your audio player. This Cassette Adapter uses a much more durable cord, which gives it better reliability and sound quality. I have had no problems whatsoever with this unit and would recommend it to anyone.

29,A1B0RTVS4SE88W,B000001OM4,Tanna Lim tantheman,"[24, 24]","I did a lot of investigating before buying this product. I ended up buying it mainly because it was the only one with decent reviews that I could find in stores. However, I am not disappointed at all. The sound isn't quite CD quality but it's pretty darn good and definitely better than a regular tape. I don't have an FM adapter but from what I read, the cassette adapters have a much better sound.The other big bonus is that it doesn't matter which way the larger opening is on your tape deck because this adapter has a latch you can open on the bottom to change the cord over to the other side if needed. Warning, some brand name adapters will only work in tape players facing a certain direction! Every once in a while I have to put the tape in twice for it to work right; otherwise I haven't had any other problems with this and it gives my mp3 player a great sound! Another tip: if you don't have an equalizer on your car stereo or mp3 player, what you can do is adjust the volume on the player and your stereo to balance the bass and treble (for me, if I have the mp3 player sound lower and the car stereo louder, I'll have more treble...and a little more static, too).As an aside, I doubt the product itself was the problem for the person with the bad car speakers who reviewed this product negatively.",4,great sound,1125187200,"08 28, 2005",0.1946

However, I was pleasantly surprised -- not only that the sound was acceptable, but it is actually quite good! As a professional MIDI musician, I'm pretty demanding in what I consider good; this Maxell adapter far exceeds what I was expecting from this type of technology.I understand that there are going to be numerous variables in play with what every consumer can expect in the way of sound quality. Probably the largest factor is going to be the quality of the cassette deck that will be using the device, specifically, the playback heads. The results weren't quite as impressive in one of my in-home cassette decks, though still good.Another very important factor is the quality of the MP3's being played; the better the playback device, the more readily you'll hear the shortcomings of a MP3 or other digital file. After all, some people are happy with 128 kbps MP3's (which are pretty low quality to begin with) and none of my MP3's are less than 256 kbps ... even those I've purchased from Amazon.Overall, I'm very happy with this device and consider it a very good, inexpensive alternative to having a dedicated LINE IN/LINE OUT option like those you find on newer in-car decks.
