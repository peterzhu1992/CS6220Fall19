Cannot say for sure that the product didn't work, or the machine is just broken. Machine started to not recognize certain cds that it played before.

Then I thought, hey, why not for just a few bucks try this cleaner and maybe it'll work. It did! The cleaner is extremely easy to use. You insert the cleaner disk into your CD player and follow the directions, which are said aloud to you, and in no time the cleaning is done. After it's done cleaning, the disk plays some nice classical music for you, too. I ejected the cleaning disk, inserted one of my CDs and voila! It was working again!",5,I'm shocked it worked,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",0.1

I orderd this lens cleaner and the transformation was instant, plays all my games w no freeze. I also hav a few high end DVD units, one an expensive Samsung DVD recorder that stopped recording and playing discs and a Toshiba upconversion DVD player that stopped reconizing and playing discs. I popped the lens cleaner in and their both working beautiful now, I was going to throw them out. A great product, and I can use it over and over if I hav any other devices that stop reading and playing discs.",5,I payed under $3,1281657600,"08 13, 2010",0.4632
4,A3EUSH8DPW75LR,B00000J1QK,barry,"[4, 4]","I purchased this from Amazon 4 years ago and here it is 4 years later and it still works perfectly. I had to write a review on such a great product. It is a definite inconvenience when any of your electronic pieces hit the road. Your television, cd player, receiver, computer, etc. These are all necessities and if any of them break down they must be replaced immediately regardless of budget.I live in a highrise apartment right in downtown Boston and there is much dust. When a cd player starts acting up you don't know what's going on at first. If its dead, its dead. But if cds are skipping or playing errartically what do you do? Is it the player itself? First you clean the cds. Maybe its a simple problem. Well, my cd player was having a field day at the time - cds jumping and skipping all over. I purchased this product, used it correctly and voila - the cd player worked perfectly. All the problems cleared up. Now, whenever it starts to skip I know it is from dust or something in the player and it just needs a simple clean.Bottom line, this product is inexpensive and it works to perfection. I have had it 4 years and it is still going strong. I highly recommend this product. Finally, something that actually does what it says it does.",5,Definitely works - a must have,1224374400,"10 19, 2008",0.1533

My console pretty much stopped reading discs. I would have to eject a disc, and put it back in at least 10 times before it would read it. I ordered this based on the reviews. I figured that it may not read the cleaner disc right away, since it didn't read my games. So I put it in, it would spin up, and then would say no disc. This only happened once! The next time I ran it, it read the disc! To be safe, I ran the disc 3 times. I put in a game it would not read, and it read it on the first try!

7,A3MMVTD7DA3PJ8,B00000J1QK,C. O. Dickerson,"[3, 4]","My car's 6 CD changer was intermittently losing and skipping sound in the left channel. Because the right channel remained OK I did not think it might be a dirt or cleaning issue. I figured both left and right channels should be affected. I lamented over my player for weeks because I could ill-afford whatever the cost might have been to even have a tech check out a fancy Bose CD player embedded in the dashboard of a car. I gradually listened to my player less and less because knowing the sound problem just made me more sensitive to the imperfections when they occurred. Finally I figured, what have I got to lose just to find out if this is a dirt problem? $8 bucks compared to all other alternatives was a small price to pay. Hola macarola...I'll be darned if this disc didn't cure my player immediately! I wish I had given this thing a shot a lot sooner. Technically there was problem though. The instructions say the CD has sound. It's supposed to alert you when it's done cleaning or whatever. My product produced no sound at any time. I inserted it into my player and my dash display simply blinked indicating a playing disc. It ran, and ran, and ran. It never alerted me in any way that the process was over nor did it stop running on its own. I simply had to eject it. I deducted one star only because of this technicality.",4,A CD savior,1285891200,"10 1, 2010",-0.0886

This cleaner, used one time, fixed the problem. Problem hasn't occurred again, in more than a year.I was hesitant to try it....some reviews and advice said it could ruin the system.

Then I decided to try the Allsop CD laser-lens cleaner. It cured my problem in less than 5 minutes. So, if the problems you are experiencing are the result of dirt or dust this is a simple and effective solution. But, don't expect it to cure mechanical or other problems. If your CD drive is giving you problems, this is worth a try. If it doesn't work you are not out much and you know the problem isn't dirt on the lens. My only complaint is that it is not clear when it is through cleaning, so I cleaned the lens 3 times before I was convinced it was done.",5,Simple and Effective,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",-0.0948
