Sometimes we split up in the mall. One of us goes to do some shopping while the other has fun with the kids. We don't have to worry about setting up a time and place to meet up. It's easy to ask a question or change/make plans from 1/2 mile away. We use it on hikes and while walking around the neighborhood. They're also great when you are travelling with more than one car.The range is supposed to be about 2 miles. It can differ depending where you are.Everything I've said is a good reason to by any 2-way radio. Why did I choose this model even though it costs a lot more than some of the other ones?-They're compact. Even more compact than the the 280's that take regular batteries. Their size makes them easy to bring along anywhere. They also have a removeable belt clip. Clip them on your pants or belt or remove the clip and they slip easily into your pocket. -They're rugged. The 280's survived drops onto pavement and gallons of baby drool. -They have 14 channels and 38 privacy codes. If you go somewhere where there is a large crowd, you will run into other people with radios. The extra channels help you find a quiet channel. However, we rarely have to change channels.We've had ours for almost 2 years now and they have been very useful.",5,We use our TalkAbout 280 all the time,965088000,"08 1, 2000",0.2461

2,A305FHDAKFC9LQ,B00000J3HB,kanga,"[7, 8]","If you have children who like to roam, then the Motorola TalkAbouts are essential equipment! I have used them to keep in touch with my children when they have played in different soccer fields, when they ride their bikes in the park, when camping, picnicing and hiking. The units are easy to use, even for a 5-year-old. It makes them feel important, too, so they willingly keep in touch.I have found the TalkAbouts to easily withstand the rigours of active pre-teen boys, and the reception has been good, even in built-up areas.Battery use is reasonable, the units are tough and easy to use.Any parent will find a use for these!",5,Essential Parenting Tool,963187200,"07 10, 2000",0.5222
3,A9U1BQILTMSMM,B00000J3HB,Laura Haggarty,"[3, 4]","My husband, young daughters and I own horses, and trailride at least once a week. Santa brought us four of these lovely little two-ways this year at Christmas, and I couldn't be more pleased. We've had none of the troubles noted in the other reviews, (although we don't ride on mountaintops), and my children find the radios simple to use and easy to understand (not to mention the cool factor!).The radios are durable; we've dropped them in snowbanks, had them grawed on by curious horses, and thumped around in saddlebags. They're certainly useful, we know if one of us gets separated from the others they'll be able to radio in and figure out where we are. And for what we use them for, they're just perfect. We looked at a bunch of GPS handhelds, and decided we didn't need anything quite that high end. For the average family who hikes or skis, trailrides or just goes to the Mall of America, these are the perfect belt accessory. Go for it!",5,A useful gadget for the average family outing...,981849600,"02 11, 2001",0.3545
