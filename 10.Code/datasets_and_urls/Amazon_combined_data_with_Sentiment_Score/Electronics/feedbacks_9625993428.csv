0,ARUQAU51OAMTQ,9625993428,A. Jackson,"[0, 0]","I bought this for my iPod 2G. I wanted to take advantage of Skype calling my family. The mic itself is small, about as big as a horse pill or a paperclip to you youngins who don't know that a horse pill is any big a** pill you try to swallow...LOL I have a little pouch in my purse I keep it in so I don't lose it...because you will lose it. The sound was good when I recorded a voice memo. But you have to remove it to hear anything back. THAT's the kicker!It's a restriction of the device, not the mic. I thought I could use the mic to speak and my Bluetooth headphones to listen at the same time. No such luck. You have to get the iPod headphones with built in mic/recorder to do that. So all I can use this for is to record stuff and listen later. But it was cheap, so it's still a cool addition to my toys. Oh, and I also got the iPod headphones with mic... those too live in my little pouch of goodies...LOL",5,Pretty darn cool mic for iPod 2G,1316736000,"09 23, 2011",0.0156

4,A2462LPFBLFKT6,9625993428,Anton Lemeza,"[18, 19]",I just got my mini mic and my Chill Pill Rapcap in the mail today.I bought both for my iPod Class 120gig for recording lectures. I didnt want to get one at a time to compare so I just bought both. My mini mic cost me $.34 and just under $4 shipping and rapcap was $14.50 and free shipping.I compared both for sound quality and distance at which they pick up sound. Turns out the only difference is the rapcap is white plastic spray painted pretty while the mini mic is either white or black plastic. Also the Rapcap is about .5mm smaller in diameter but same size in length. The caps construction is identical. Both work identical. Everything is the same. The only thing to test is durability but I'm confident it will be the same.So save the money and buy this one over the RapCap. They pick up sound great from a distance if you have it about 10 feet away from an instructor so just plug it in and stand it up near the instructors desk or sit near where he or she talks and youll be fine. I have a flip open case so I can plug mine in and stand it up so ill pick up sound great.Only complaint I have is that I bought the Rapcap too.,5,Identical to RapCap,1270684800,"04 8, 2010",0.1652

We put it on our 5-6 year old I-pod touch that our son plays with so that he can play all of his talking animal games. Despite reviews that stated it didn't work because the I-pod thinks there are headphones in, we have not had that issue with any of our talking games with the exception of the talking Angela game. I put the mic in and rebooted the I-pod and it worked perfectly. I thought perhaps I would have to remove the case based on other reviews but there was no issue there either. I was actually ready to take my I-pod to the Apple store and see if we could have a mic added but this $3.00 dollar microphone was the answer for us.",5,Updated our older I-pod touch,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",0.2188

Note other reviewers have noted you can't both have it in the iPod touch to use as a microphone and hear sound from the speakers - this is a limitation of the iPod touch, and I refuse to give this item a negative review based on the limitations of the iPod touch like so many others have. You CAN use it to make a Skype call, and both speak into the microphone and hear through the speakers if you set the call to speaker, either when making or receiving a call.
