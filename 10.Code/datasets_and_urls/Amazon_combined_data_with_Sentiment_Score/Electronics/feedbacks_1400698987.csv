The kindle does not annotate and curate highlighted text of pdf's you upload. This is where I found the Nook HD more useful, apart from the fact that it gives you full access to the Play Store. In handling big pdf's, the Nook HD is slow and the highlighting of scanned pdf's is not very smooth. I really tried to love the Nook but did not and so I did not use it beyond the first month. I will not recommend the Nook. If your goal is the android store, just get a nexus tablet and download B&N app. It is cheap and works much better than the Nook.",2,Feels Ancient,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",Angel Book Reader book reviewer,0.21

All because I wanted to know why my the touch screen on my nook stopped responding to input.Then I called and was literally cussed (f word) at a minute in for asking about what was wrong with their live chat. Maybe I was just really unlucky and the person I talked to was angry or planning on quitting or something, but I still find it unacceptable.Seriously, go with a kindle or something else instead.

8,A35SB5XA89HR41,1400698987,"[38, 42]","I had given my kids a Nook Color a couple years ago. Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out. They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an app drawer icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching. It really is a great design, and far superior to the tiresome carousel on the Kindle Fires.",5,We LOVE the NOOK HD!,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",bookloveranne booklover6,0.1704

17,A3OLLN3VV2SF0L,1400698987,"[1, 1]","I bought this refurb for under $100 and so glad I did! I tried the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (expensive and glitchy), the Lenvovo Idea Tab (poor performance) before I settled on the Nook. After using tablets at both high and low-end price points I figured I had nothing to lose--and was pleasantly surprised by the Nook's capabilities!On the Nook I can read BN or Kindle books, play Scrabble from the Android store, and watch Netflix. More advanced features such as GPS and camera are unnecessary for me, and I enjoy the simplicity of this device. It has a sturdy build and even though I did not want a white tablet (fear of dirt) it has not been an issue. I have had it for several months and don't feel anxious about using it without a cover.It's ease of use, clean interface, adequate battery life, and features make this a winner for me in the under $100 category. Add to that BN's 1-year warranty and I am more than satisfied with my purchase.My only qualm with the Nook HD is that it has a proprietary charging cable (not a micro usb like cell phones) so it is an extra cord to carry when traveling. In addition, it will not fit just any usb plug (something to do with wattage, I think). So if you plug the usb end into a travel charger or car charger it may not work. Same thing with using a usb port on a computer. IMO this is a major limitation for an otherwise great device, especially for someone that travels frequently.",4,Excellent value and performance,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",misscrusty,0.2248

The screen is amazing. The addition of Google play makes this an incredible value in a tablet. It also turns it into a Kindle. The kids are busy on all our long car rides. The SD card make it completely expandable. We can watch Netflix with Wi=fi or load the SD card with movies for a road trip. It's under 100 bucks too.

20,A3I4MTIXADZFYS,1400698987,"[100, 104]","I recently bought the nook HD white for 129 greenbacks from BN. I had originally purchased a Kindle Fire HD. The Nook is lighter and the screen is brighter/sharper than the Kindle Fire. With the recent update to allow the full version of Google Play, a lot of the original limitations with the Nook have gone away. The chrome browser beats Silk all the way. You can actually download the Kindle App from the Google appstore and read all the books. However, you cannot install the amazon appstore and I had to buy some of the apps from Google play that I had originally purchased. There are no ads with the nook. Even with the Fathers day sale (which put the Kindle no-ad version at 195), this is cheaper by 65 bucks. An additional benefit is you can add an external SD card and there are options to boot a full blown standard Android Jellybean from the SD card with the nook from places like (AFN - android for nook for just 10 bucks).The two main downsides are that it lacks a front facing camera, but I really have no use for that and the parental controls are not that easy to set as in the Kindle (you can create a child profile and make sure that the password has to be entered, but I have not fully figured it out).I liked it so much that I bought a second nook in smoke color today.",5,Best performance and unbeatable value in 7inch tablet,1371945600,"06 23, 2013",Petiteface gadget lover,0.062

I settled on the nook because I had read nothing but good reviews and the price was excellent.Positive:It has a beautiful screen with great vibrant color. The adjustable backlight is great for night time reading and reading in the sun.It's lightweight and comfortable to read with.Negetive: I find it has many glitches. From having trouble unlocking my screen, to having trouble getting the screen to even turn on so I can unlock it, to having my kindle application crash every time I get to the end of the book. I understand that it is probably an application issue with kindle, BUT having kindle compatibility was an absolute priority for me, as most of my library is on amazon. Furthermore, my battery doesn't last at all. I have to power down my device every time I put it down, otherwise by the time I pick it up again to read, it's dead. Won't even last a day. I've figured out that disconnecting it from wifi helps it last longer but not nearly enough. I was used to an iPad that lasted almost a week without charging. This battery time is unconvenient and unacceptable.Those are the main glitches that impact my experience with this device. I don't recommend getting this tablet.
