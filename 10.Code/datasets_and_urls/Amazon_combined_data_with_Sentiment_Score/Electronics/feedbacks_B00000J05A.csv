With 500 lines of resolution (Using the S-video connector cable), this system has the same picture quality of any current DVD player (dont be fooled!), The sound can still be decoded for dolby surround.

1,AT2BYFEVLVITT,B00000J05A,D. Wetzel,"[0, 0]","This dvd player is cheap for a reason. You get what you pay for. Most of the time this player works fine. But sometimes the picture will cut out and give you just a blue screen. You can sometimes just tap the machine and it comes back on, other times you have to stop the movie and open the tray just to get rid of the blue screen. Luckily this doesn't happen that often. If you don't have a lot of money to spend on a dvd player, go for it, but if you can spend more i would recommend something on the higher end of the scale.",3,"Good dvd player, most of the time.",958003200,"05 11, 2000",0.0695
2,A3HE9I4GQ4OXYE,B00000J05A,James W. Anderson,"[8, 8]","I've had the displeasure of owning two RCA brand DVD players and neither one made it more than a year before breaking. I had this DVD player and a Proscan DVD/DIVX (which the salesman at [...] SWORE was the best that money could buy). The RCA DVD just quit working entirely after 11 months (microprocesor). My [$] Proscan DVD player now displays a NO DISC message seemingly at random, and for no particular reason. Sometimes you can put a disc in and it will play the first time, others you have to try it a few times, and on the worst days you may have to try 15-20 times and it still may not work.In both cases I called RCA, sat on hold for some ridiculous amount of time, spoke to someone in technical support who knew nothing about technical support, and was ultimately told it would cost more to repair than to replace.RCA's warranty is useless, their technical support line is an exercise in futility, and I personally don't think it's worth the money to repair any of their poorly engineered products. I've learned my lesson with RCA and will specifically avoid their products in the future.",1,DO NOT BUY!,995846400,"07 23, 2001",-0.1602

I've had it for a year now - and not ONCE did it ever give me a problem - watch the matrix regularly. I get rental DVD's (more scratched - usually &quot;more difficult to play&quot;) about twice a week - and in the last 6 months of renting so frequently I have never had a disc that gave me a problem.Overall, I think there's no reason to buy a more expensive DVD player - like cd players, they're one and the same unless you're really descriminate about quality or features not detectable to an average consumer.",5,Loved it so much I bought another,958521600,"05 17, 2000",-0.3911

However, I decided to give it a try and am thoroughly glad I did. Great picture, great sound! Plenty of features. I have not experienced a single problem with error messages on any of the DVD's I've purchased. This is one great little machine for the price!",5,Great Entry-level DVD Player at an Affordable Price,940723200,"10 24, 1999",0.2279
5,A6FIAB28IS79,B00000J05A,Samuel Chell,"[3, 3]","Not having either a DVD or CD player (I just feed discs to my iMac), I found the discounted price on this model to be all the rationale I needed to invest in such a device. It's capable of producing flawless images and sounds--unless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive, which happens far too often with my temperamental (fastidious?) machine. I would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions, as this model requires extra deep shelves. Finally, its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with GE or other RCA monitors than with Philips, Magnavox, or Sylvania monitors. (It may be important to remember that a VCR plus DVD assembly requires running the latter in &quot;auxilliary mode,&quot; which is hidden away somewhere in my set's menu choices and virtually inaccessible.) In short, the machine has done little to alter my high regard for similar products produced by Sony, Panasonic, and other Japanese manufacturers.",3,Worrisome machine.,985564800,"03 26, 2001",0.1376
6,AHY2KG32696ES,B00000J05A,SL,"[0, 0]","I bought this player about a year and a half ago. It worked great (for about 3 months). It played all the DVDs and CDs. Unfortunately, it cannot read VCDs or CD-R/RWs. For most people that doesn't matter, I guess. However, only after about 3 months of light usage, the player started to act-up. Sometimes, it won't read the DVDs--the player indicated &quot;no disc&quot; in player. I unplugged it and it worked after re-plugging it 1 minute later. Then, it doesn't work again, and I repeated the same procedure of unplugging. Finally, I sent the player back to RCA. Since it was still under warranty, all I had to do was pay for shipping. It came back after about a month. It worked, and then I started to see the problem again within a couple of days. I was confused. Why does it work sometimes but sometimes it fails to work? So, I tested it out to see the prob. myself. It appeared that the disc tray motor sounded weak, and being unable to read the disc, I thought, could be due to the fact that RCA had provided a weak motor part. I was half right. I removed the plug from the UPS/power supply and plugged it directly into the wall. Ever since, the player was plugged directly into the wall, it shows no problem. I think I may have found a solution (for now)--the difficulty in reading the disc, I concluded, was due to lack of power [believe it or not]. Well, if you have the same problem, try unplugging it and have a dedicated power supply for this player. It might work.Beside this, the machine is good. It played every single DVDs I've ever rented or bought. I have this hooked up to my reciever through TosLink (optical cable). The sound is excellent--good proportion of sound from center, satellite, rear and subwoofer. It plays CD but it takes a second or 2 to skip to songs. Basically, don't expect it to play it like a real cd player. It sounded just as good though. The picture quality is excellent. Eventhough I don't have an HDTV, I could still clearly see the improvement over the VHS, or BETAMax tapes. I'm getting rid of it now because I want a new and better player that also plays VCDs.",2,good luck getting one that works perfectly,981504000,"02 7, 2001",0.0808
