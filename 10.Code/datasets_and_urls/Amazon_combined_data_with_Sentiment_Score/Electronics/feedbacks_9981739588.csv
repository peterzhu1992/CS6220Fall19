It works great and appears well made and should last a long time, especially where only the mini-HDMI connector will the inserted and removed multiple times. No issues with it being loose, weak, or ready to break. Hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge. It arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition, and the shipping was exactly when they said it would be.",5,Very Good Mini-HDMI to HDMI Cable,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",0.1107

4,A1W0CHSU0O5VUK,9981739588,M. Riegle,"[0, 0]",Bought this hoping it would be as good as the $20 one at Staples. For the price...why not try it? Works great. No graininess. No interruption of transmission. Perfect length for my purposes. They must have just had an abundance and wanted to get rid of them because they are top quality.,5,Works great,1314403200,"08 27, 2011",0.2956

Thukral,"[2, 5]","Just to give you a brief history, I had contacted CITI electronics before buying this product, if it is going to be compatible with my Canon HF200 video camera. Their response; YES. Considering how much the original one costs, I went the cheaper route; and it bit me right back. THIS CABLE DOES NOT WORK. Citi electronics lied (Just another California bases electronics retailer selling Chinese junk). Now, they expect me to pay for shipping even if the product is defective. Wonder if Amazon even goes through a selection process anymore. Overall, a very very bad experience. Never buying anything from Citi electronics again. Will have to buy original canon cable. There should be a way of actually making it zero star.",1,Hate this item - and CITI electronics,1274054400,"05 17, 2010",-0.0152
