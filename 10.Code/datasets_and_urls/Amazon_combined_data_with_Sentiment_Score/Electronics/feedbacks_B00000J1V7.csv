0,A2FRFAQCWZJT3Q,B00000J1V7,B. Davis The Happy Hermit,"[0, 0]","I have a HTPC and even though its rare sometimes I do need to use a keyboard with it. I had a large print keyboard that is so easy to see in a not so brightly lit TV viewing area that I wanted to use. Got this cable and routed it from the PC, around the back of the TV, and that puts the keyboard at a comfortable location for typing on.",5,An affordable solution!,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",0.2599
1,A2VAJSG4VJ0II2,B00000J1V7,Bluebird,"[0, 0]",This cable is NOT available in any store in our area so BIG thanks to Amazon for making unusual items like this readily available to everyone everywhere. Keyboard cables are too short and this was exactly what I wanted. Being tipical Belkin quality is obvious immediately & it works perfect. Does not have that flatspot to plug into tower like the keyboard does so I marked the missing pin space with a majic marker on the cord to make finding the proper alignment easy to find when you want to plug it in again.,5,Just what I wanted,1317513600,"10 2, 2011",0.4658

3,A2BGJ5ABQEERDU,B00000J1V7,GJODIGITAL,"[0, 0]","Needed to extend keyboard for older style desk. Six feet was clean, simple, and perfect fit. Cable flexible enough to move well without being so stiff it hangs up.",5,Worked Perfect,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",0.4909
4,AJT510WEA1QHV,B00000J1V7,Greesemonkey3,"[0, 0]",This was a must have for my windows 95 keyboard! I enjoy the classic keyboards and this made it that much easier to use!,5,Great addition!,1384992000,"11 21, 2013",0.3712
5,A2UU3ZOWZLA2SP,B00000J1V7,HPD202 L. Natelborg,"[0, 0]",great cable. works great and was plenty long enough for my purposes. Belkin is a great brand for this kind of stuff too,5,good buy,1386028800,"12 3, 2013",0.6249
6,A37WVR9M1STQDU,B00000J1V7,J. Musto Toolman Joe,"[1, 1]",This is just an extension cable to be used for a keyboard. Most keyboards today have very short cables and this fixed the problem. You may want to tape the two cables together with electrical tape to prevent them from pulling apart but mine had not pulled out so far.,5,Good quality cable at reasonable price.,1271548800,"04 18, 2010",-0.1168
7,A3AOGYPD6MVBYZ,B00000J1V7,K. J. M.,"[0, 0]","I needed this for my old computer, which I use when I want to pretend it's still the 90s. I had a slight fear that the extra length - my keyboard's already long cable plus this one - would cause problems with the strength of the signal, but everything's fine. And how sweet it is to finally be able to sit at my desk, far from that computer, without a keyboard cable stretched across my monitor screen.",5,Exactly as I hoped it'd be,1330560000,"03 1, 2012",0.1867
8,A1IJOBQD8CY8K1,B00000J1V7,kwmar,"[0, 0]","This extension fits into my older PC's PS/2 port better than the cable from the keyboard! The connection is snug, but not too tight. It works just as well on my new self-built Win 8 computer. I've got an old keyboard that is really great, so I'm using it alternately for both computers.",5,Well-made extension for older PS/2 connection,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",0.4653
9,AP6T0CI46U93Z,B00000J1V7,lala crazy gamer,"[3, 3]","Work as they are supposed to. I sit about 5 or 6 feet away from my monitor, so these are perfect. I go through to many batteries in wireless keyboards and mouse's, so this has saved me tons.",5,Nice,1200096000,"01 12, 2008",0.3593
10,A1QXBKNTVF2BNV,B00000J1V7,M. Pagano,"[0, 0]","If you want a longer cord on an older non-usb keyboard, this extension cable works great.Keyboard plugs into it snugly and wont fall out easily while moving it around or lightly tugging on it.",5,Worked fine,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",-0.1867
11,A1WFQPYY8YBXEM,B00000J1V7,NewMan Simplify,"[0, 0]","It's Belkin. What more to say? Nice tight connections and it works. Probably will have only wireless mice soon, but this was handy when I needed it and it didn't give me any problems.",5,Works fine,1265328000,"02 5, 2010",-0.0321
12,A33ZNSZSZ580D9,B00000J1V7,Pete B Energy comes from within,"[1, 1]",I have two of these connected together to extend my keyboard from the computer. I would definitely purchase again. Thanks.,5,No Complaints,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",0.3401
13,AGCN38LIJZM3K,B00000J1V7,piratesmvp04,"[0, 0]","I use this to connect an old PS/2 keyboard to my HTPC, and it works fine. I bought this to replace a generic brand that wore out, so hopefully this name brand will be better.",5,Works well,1377734400,"08 29, 2013",0.4762
14,A135MK4P9G8EDX,B00000J1V7,Professor,"[0, 0]","The configuration of my office made it impossible for my cpu and monitor to be close enough together to use the existing cables. So, I purchased these extension cables and they work beautifully. They were the exact same product as sold in stores for 3 times the cost and there is no loss of function. I would recommend this product to others needing just a little more length in those cables.",5,does the job!,1208736000,"04 21, 2008",0.2935
15,A21ZZUXAM2PUCA,B00000J1V7,The Lords Hand (core gamer),"[0, 0]",again and again i find stuff on amazon for far cheaper then in store. We have best buy where i live and have to go there for parts. They are so overpriced that i have stopped going there and am more then happy to wait for belivery. I am a pc gamer and play on a 55 in my living room. I had been using wireless keyboards but they always were haveing range or interference problems so i bought this cord. More then enuff length for me to use my keyboard anywhere in my living room.,5,Buy This on Amazon Not In A Store.,1330214400,"02 26, 2012",0.1796
16,A2TKWMX4563NR6,B00000J1V7,thenightfly dee,"[0, 0]","don't quite understand what I need to say about this product, it's an extension cord, it extends the distance between the motherboard and the keyboard and/or mouse.",5,does what its supposed to,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",0.128
17,A2U7QPASO59UO1,B00000J1V7,wildcatter wildcatter,"[0, 0]","Not much to say. Belkin makes good products in general and this is one of them. I have purchased several of these for home and at the office. They work fine for both mouse and keyboard. I still use one of them (in conjunction with a USB to PS/2 adapter) for a USB mouse too, because that way I can use the PS/2 mouse port on my older computer and free up one of my USB ports, which I don't have enough of.",5,Works like a charm,1329523200,"02 18, 2012",0.2307
