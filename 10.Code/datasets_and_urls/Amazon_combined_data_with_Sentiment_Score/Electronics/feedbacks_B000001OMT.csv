It is playing the tapes as before and I cannot tell any difference in sound quality, but I should say that the quality was never that bad. I used this product because the player started showing me that message and that problem is not solved. I really don't know whether the cleaner did not do its job or simply my player is faulty (or have other issues).",3,I am not sure if it cleaned,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",0.1427
2,A3PL8ENSYWS1PZ,B000001OMT,Cheri,"[1, 1]","We bought this Maxell Audio Head Cleaner to clean our tape heads on our tape cassette player (which is now obsolete being that it was created and used by us in the dinosaur age). It performed exactly as described. It cleaned up the audio heads quite nicely...the music doesn't sound muffled or unclear. Now we can play and listen to the oldies of our time the way we used to. If you own a retro tape cassette player, then by all means, get this audio head cleaner, it'll make it as good as new. Great product, highly recommend.",5,Effective Maxell Audio Tape Head Cleaner,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",0.3209

The Maxell 19 10 18 offers the quicker approach (It will not give you the results of the more time consuming). The labor intensified cleaning means taking the door off the deck (For the units that allow this) and cleaning the pinch rollers and heads with specifically designed swabs and fluid.If you want faster results, Maxell has done almost all the work for us. The cleaner looks like a standard cassette. The instructions will specify the amount of liquid to add to the cleaning tape and the length of time to play in the deck. Presto that is it!As always, try to use quality tapes such as Maxell or TDK for the cassette portion and please keep the tape heads clean or it circumvents the idea of a nice investment. Dirty heads will give the playback muddy results.Enjoy the music and be well,Craig FentonAuthor of the Jefferson Airplane book Take Me To A Circus Tent",3,Clean the tape deck or it will be washed up fast!,1183507200,"07 4, 2007",0.2376
4,A248LSBZT4P38V,B000001OMT,Joseph R. Kennedy,"[8, 8]",I use this in conjunction with a demagnetizing tape head cleaner cassette. Both are the same exact thing except that this one has no rotating magnet in it. I wet this cassette with plenty of cleaning fluid and it improves the quality of my playback after playing filthy old cassettes. I play it with the dry demagnetizing tape to dry it off and polish it while demagnetizing it. I recommend this tape in conjunction with a demagnetizing head cleaner cassette as well.,5,Works Great!,1214956800,"07 2, 2008",0.2856

Messineo mhm,"[7, 7]","I'm copying old cassettes to MP3s, and some of the tapes are a real mess, so after running a couple through the tape player, the player starts to sound really mushy. A couple runs through with this tape head cleaner, and it's back to clear sound again.One thing ... I noticed another reviewer complained that they were not able to get the liquid out of the bottle because the bottle was too stiff to squeeze ... I also had this problem until I realized that you have to stick a pin inside the dropper to break the seal - after that it worked perfectly.",5,Worked just as advertised!,1225324800,"10 30, 2008",0.0038
