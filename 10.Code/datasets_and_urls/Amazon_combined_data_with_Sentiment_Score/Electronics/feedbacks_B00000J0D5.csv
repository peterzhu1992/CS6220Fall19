I was able to connect to the internet at 1/10th the normal speed due to the insufficient connection.

I only bought this thing to get a credit on my DISH network bill. (They don't tell you they charge per month if you don't have it plugged into a phone line, just that you get a credit each month if you do.) For one year, it doesn't pay, but for a 2-YR contract, it pays itself off after the first year. So, since I didn't have any phone lines anywhere near by, this thing works just fine for what I need.",5,Needed for DISH network,1233792000,"02 5, 2009",0.2008

This was very good for my needs, but I did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets. I also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would talk to each other and transfer the caller ID signal; but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlessly.",4,Works well for Caller ID,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",-0.0322
5,A8TZ88OM8YOLW,B00000J0D5,MartyHansen,"[21, 23]","I've used the RCA RC930 Wireless Modem Jacks to create a poor man's wireless network in my home. It works! And I love it! I can now sit in any chair of my house, surf the web, and print (across the room) to my wireless HP 995 Bluetooth printer.My system consists of two sets of RCA Wireless Modem Jacks (a sender and receiver unit in each set) -- one set for the upstairs and one set for the downstairs (which appear to be on separate circuits and are not connected); a 3Com Bluetooth PC card for my laptop; and a HP 995 Bluetooth printer.I now use my laptop in the following manner: first, I plug the RCA receiving unit into the wall outlet nearest where I want to sit; then I turn on the printer; and finally, I extend the little blue tooth-shaped antenna (how cute!) on the laptop's PC card -- and I'm all set to go!The RCA Modem Jack is good up to 56k, which is ok since I don't have internet cable or DSL service in my area. But I'll gladly trade-off mobility for speed any day. Here's why.My desktop computers (old and new) are in my upstairs bedrooms -- where I can't use them when my family is sleeping. They are also far away from where my family spends most of its time -- and that's downstairs by the TV's.With the RCA wireless modem jacks, I can now access the internet --- while watching TV with my family; and I can surf the net long after everyone has gone to sleep -- when internet speeds are fastest. The connection is fairly clean (free of static); and the transfer speed is nearly as fast as if I had accessed the phone jack directly.I've gotten very used to sitting in my favorite chair and surfing the net. When cable or DSL eventually come to my neighborhood, I guess I'll have to set up a wireless network in my home (for a lot more money) -- in order to maintain my mobility.Until then, I'll use the next best thing -- RCA's Wireless Modem Jacks. They're great!",5,A Poor Man's Wireless Network -- That Works!,1016409600,"03 18, 2002",0.3944

SO DISAPPOINTED!!!i got it for $35 so im not that mad, but still i paid for something i should not have bought in the first place..",1,should have read the reviews more closely...,1147305600,"05 11, 2006",-0.1116
7,AK10GGT97M7QK,B00000J0D5,Not My Real Name,"[8, 8]","Had a small setup problem (I needed to do the security setup before it would let me hear a dialtone), otherwise I use it on my tivo and it works just fine (so far).Update (several years later). This unit is really lousy. I called tivo for an unrelated issue one day, and the guy on the phone said you're using one of those wireless modem things aren't you - he could tell because my dialup pattern was an abbatoir. I didn't know because the tivo managed to mask the failures, but after trying several online tivo updates, I got to finding out how much this really doesn't work. I have a series 2 tivo now and am using an 802.11 network which is infinitely better and faster.",4,It kind-of sucks really,963792000,"07 17, 2000",-0.0533

10,A229KNRZM9URT,B00000J0D5,Samit Banerjee Personal Maverick,"[1, 1]",I bought this for a spare bedroom where we did not have a telephone jack. Installation was a snap and it works great.

11,A83N14T7FQV82,B00000J0D5,S. Houston,"[0, 0]","The wireless modem/phone jack idea is a great one, but it rarely works the way it is intended. Whether it's interference from other electronics, old house wiring, or any number of things, it tends to have a poor signal resulting in a bad connection. If you're using this for either a modem, security system that requires a phone line, or a telephone jack, it's likely not going to give you the results you want. My recommendation would be to go ahead and have a phone drop and jack installed and call it a day. It may be a more expensive option, but it's by far the best one.",2,Skip it and have a line installed,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",0.1071

The stations are about 20 feet apart with a wall and furniture in between, but I have not had connectivity issues. I have two wireless networks (b and g)in the same area and have not had the interference problems others have mentioned. That said, my parents tried using the same system in their home and got lots of static and dropped modem connections over a 15 ft. line-of-sight installation with no other wireless networks, so the system seems to be somewhat picky.",4,Good for DirecTV,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",-0.0972
