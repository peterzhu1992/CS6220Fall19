Not much else to say except that these are great money savers for high powered lights like mine.UPDATE 9/14/2013: These batteries are still running as strong as they were when I purchased them, so I have increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars. They work great in my work light, Fenix TK35, which is a highly demanding power consuming unit.

10,AKGGVHCCW4RKA,9575871979,"[47, 52]","I made the mistake of abandoning my normal principal of you get what you pay forI was excited to find these so inexpensively and had planned to use them in my SU-800 master controller for photography. The quality batteries for this unit average around $16.00 each, so the idea of getting four batteries with a charger cheaper than the cost of two normal batteries was just appealing to my green sense.Now I'm back to the single use batteries, as these rechargeable's let me down time and again... when freshly charged, they often showed voltage ratings well above 4v and this isn't workable in my units. So, I let them run down a tad and they are usable for a blink, then run down quickly under normal use.Also, if they are not equally discharged and charged in twos, the charger will show both charged, while they are not equal upon removal... one battery showing a voltage rating of 2.2 and the other 4.0 fresh from the charger.I consider this to be a real problem and potentially damaging sensitive equipment if using a battery that actually has a overcharged condition. Batteries rated at 3 volts shouldn't show over 4 while in service.... and again, drain quickly.I should get 1000 cycles from my SU-800 by Nikon with a fresh battery... with these, it's more like 150-ishVery disappointed.I can't provide a review of how these batteries perform in other equipment, but if you need something that performs as rated with meaningful performance life, based on my experience with this group... please continue shopping for something better.Smart Charger- charges unpredictably3.0V batteries hold unstable charges (based on my experience with those shipped to me)Charged life- very short, around 20% of that of a normal single use battery (based on the group I received)If you need something quick and cheap for equipment with a broad operating range, then you may get something out of these.

14,A2KS0FVY2CNJ8M,9575871979,"[67, 70]","I've had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries 3 times, and a third battery once. So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery. I didn't have anything to lose so I trimmed off the plastic that was torn, and sealed the case up with some super glue. Fortunately, the battery still fit in the flashlight and it worked fine - still had a full charge! I've since charged it twice and it is still working great.

I measured the voltage and found them to be almost 4.2 volts fully charged (when it is supposed to be 3.0!!!). I don't know if this can damage a voltage regulated light, but I'm not willing to take the chance (they don't work in two separate types of flashlights I have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now). I'm returning these and buying some surefire non-rechargeable batteries. What good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work, the batteries fail? And if you aren't using it for tactical purposes, then why get a light with CR123A batteries in the first place?Even when this charger WAS working (only on the first cycle), it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says.
