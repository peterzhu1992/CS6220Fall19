This will more than likely become even harder. We located these on Amazon. They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find.

I've bought Maxell products in the past(especially cassette audio tapes and vhs tapes) and have never been disappointed. The color and sound are both exceptional on these tapes. I know that the trend is changing and these tapes are going the way of the 8-track (and I'm trying to slowly make the change over to digital media) but in the meanwhile..I can highly recommend this Maxell 4-pk for your vcr recording needs.Also-this vendor appears to be a fine one.,5,Maxell 4-pk vhs tapes,1330473600,"02 29, 2012",0.2702

DVDs are too expensive and I do not use cable or satellite or things like that.

Since these are important memories, I want to have as many backups as possible so rerecording them back onto 'fresh' VHS tapes is something important to me. Comparing these tapes to local price, the price here on Amazon is very competitive. After recording older footage onto these VHS tapes, I'm quite satisfied with the quality of these tapes on the SP record setting. Not much has changed in the VHS tape since it has become such a dinosaur, but it's great to be able to get this product when you need it, for a reasonable price.",5,Good Bargain...,1350691200,"10 20, 2012",0.4562
