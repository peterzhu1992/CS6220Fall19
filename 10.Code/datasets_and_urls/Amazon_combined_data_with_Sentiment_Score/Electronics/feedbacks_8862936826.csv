Thiel Wood, Photos, Cycling, Backpacking","[4, 9]","I've been waiting a while for this cover, and it's everything I thought it would be: Moleskine quality, substantial feel, nice holder for the iPad, and a replaceable pad. The only thing missing is a pen loop.Other vitals you may want to know:-- It's 1.375 inches in thickness with iPad loaded (that's almost an inch and a half)-- The cover doesn't appear to be leather, even though it appears to be leather. Just like the notebooks.-- Interior is microsuede-- IPad is very secure in there.-- Spine is rounded, not square-- You can fold back the entire thing so it's flat.-- Not able to prop this thing up to view from afar (too slippery), and no prop is included.-- All buttons, ports, and speakers are accessible.-- Looks good, feels good.All that said, Moleskine made a mistake with their design. While they include directions on how to flip the unit around to use it for leftys, when you do so, the cover becomes the back, and vice versa... and on your new cover, you now have an embossed Moleskine Logo--UPSIDE DOWN!It's bad enough they didn't bother with a lefty unit, but I can handle flipping it around (and having my iPad home button on top). And I can handle that once flipped the strap works the opposite of all other Moleskine products (since back is now front). But to have Moleskine expect me to start at their upside down logo all day is more than I'm willing to settle for on such a pricey item. I'm ANGRY that I waited for so long for a product with such a silly flaw.I hope they fix this, but considering how long it took them to produce the case, and how late it is coming to market even after it was announced, I don't think that they will. Too bad. Could have been a GREAT product.",1,"Nice case, but major flaws for Leftys",1291075200,"11 30, 2010",0.1524
1,A1ZU55TM45Y2R8,8862936826,J. Haggard,"[49, 53]","I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1 mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads. Sorry Moleskine, perhaps revision 2 will be the one for me, but so far your case didn't meet my expectations.",2,"It's an ok case, with some major flaws.",1291075200,"11 30, 2010",0.167
2,A16X9K6CTHEYXO,8862936826,Jongbok Yi,"[2, 2]","I have read many reviews on folio cases for iPad. You will find the best ever in most of reviews that have got over four stars. So, I won't say the cliche, but want to say that I am very satisfied. Although I love my iPad, I'd felt sad as a fountain pen collector that my fountain pens are no longer useful. Then, I bumped into this case. What a wonderful idea to put Moleskine with iPad!Someone said in the previous review that it is a inch thick, and it is true. I feel like I am holding a book. However, it makes me feel that my iPad is well protected. The quality of paper is good as always, and it is very easy to flip over. Also, it also has the rubber band! Since I don't have keen eyes to see whether it is real leather or not, but the skin feels smooth and soft.",5,The best for those iPad lovers who eager to write something,1290988800,"11 29, 2010",0.2991
3,AB7IX02UYHG2Y,8862936826,Richard Davis Computer & Gadget Geek,"[0, 0]","This product appeared to be high quality and well made. It also has the feature that turns on the iPad when the cover is opened.The Moleskin does have a very nice, luxurious feel.For me, it was just too heavy. Not in pounds, but when you hold an iPad up for a few hours, a few ounces can make a big difference.There is another iPad cover sold on Amazon that is a big seller, at around $20+, made of a synthetic material. It is much lighter, and also turns on when opened.I hate to pass on higher quality and probably longer lasting, but this Moleskin cover was just too tiring for me.",4,"Well Made Product, But....",1324080000,"12 17, 2011",0.1703
4,AQXL8B1QPVE09,8862936826,Texzen,"[0, 0]","I have owned this for a month, hoping to use it in meeting situations where iPad typing and other forms of note taking doesn't quite get it. I was stunned to learn the tablets are not available with lines. Quite an oversight as they are overpriced to begin with. The cover holds the iPad in a fairly but not definitely snug manner.It is designed primarily for left handers with the plug and button holes oriented for the iPad to be placed upside down if the writing tablet is on the right side. No big deal for a right handed person.A note to Moleskin asking about future lined tablets was responded to with a trite go kiss-off. A better product is bound to be offered soon from a more customer friendly, less smug company.",3,Fair at Best,1360972800,"02 16, 2013",0.0343
