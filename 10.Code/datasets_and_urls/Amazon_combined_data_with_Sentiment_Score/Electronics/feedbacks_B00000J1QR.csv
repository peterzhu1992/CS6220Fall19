I don't know what they're made of but they work great. They clean blu-ray as well as regular DVDs without a bit of scuffing or scatching. I followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge. For fingerprints, I found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping. The nice thing about these is that they're re-usable until they get dirty.",5,Economical cleaning solution.,1321401600,"11 16, 2011",0.3925

But ended up trying this out because of it's cheap price and it's FastWipe title, but still a bit skeptical without any wet solution.I am pleasantly surprised that the dry fabric actually removed finger print and dusts rather easily with push of a thumb from center of the disc outward. The discs are cleaned within a matter of 15 to 20 seconds for a thorough job. I find myself having fun wiping the entire collection of CDs, DVDs, and blu-ray discs.",5,No kidding that it is fast!,1290470400,"11 23, 2010",0.4213

8,A2SPHO9F2ZL98F,B00000J1QR,charles,"[0, 0]",These CD or DVD wipes are good for removing surface lint or smudges on Disks but dont expect them to remove serious glitches or hang ups. They are dry thats the first hing so they cant really be expected to remove any ingrained glitches but cetainly for the maintenance of disks and keeping them dust free these are very good. I was looking for somthing that would really help to illiminate some hang ups and getting stuck type glitches that I had so in fact I ended up just buying a new DVD of the same recording...but its a good product for maintenance. I guess the lesson I learnt is not to leave the disk in the player when not being used. Also the method to wipe off a disk is so important not to use a circular motion say like you would on an old LP recording..so I did in fact also learn something from the instructions as well.,4,Good but not Excellent wipes,1350777600,"10 21, 2012",0.4694

I was totally surprised that these wipes work so well. I have had DVD's that skipped and could see that there was junk on the surface. Taking one of these wipers and wiping the surface from the center to the edge (across the grooves) seems to get the job done. Today, my grandson managed to put part of his dinner on the bottom of a DVD he handed to me. When I put it in the player it skipped and then stopped. I pulled it out and saw the crud. I used a fresh wiper and Voila!! the DVD played without a hitch. I know I am probably not supposed to do this, but sometimes there is a minor bit of stuff on a DVD and I use a wiper and put it back in the package for another use or two. I haven't seen a downside.

29,A19JDXB5R33C7R,B00000J1QR,WryGuy2,"[8, 8]","I have small children who often put fingerprints on our kiddie DVDs. Typically, I clean them by breathing on the dirty DVD and using the inside of my T-shirt to wipe clean these DVDs. However, I began to look for another solution that didn't involve my T-shirt. This product ... the Allsop CD and DVD fast-wipes looked like a possible solution, so I ordered a pack.After giving them a try, I find they work well ... they don't get the worst of the fingerprints off without a little extra help (or in my case, a breath on the DVD), but they get about 95 percent of the fingerprints off quickly and easily. The material is lint free and works as advertised. 20 CD/DVD shaped wipes come per pack. Being shaped like a DVD is just a gimmick. I usually fold them in half or quarters before wiping, so if they were square-shaped (and thus had a little more material) it might actually be more helpful than being shaped like a circle. The instructions say that each wipe can be re-used until it becomes visably dirty or worn, so you can clean multiple DVDs per wipe.Overall, these are a good buy and work well at a reasonable price.
