Leave it in your slot all the time, it won't have an effect on your system when the CF card isn't in, but it will permanently add a CF slot to your system.This means that you can dispense with the camera-to-computer cable and just plug the card into the slot. When you do, it will be recognized as a removable disk, kind of like a Syquest or Zip disk, and show up in your &quot;My Computer&quot; view or Mac desktop, and maybe (this is how Nikon View works anyway) pop up your digicam software.This really is by far the most convenient way to deal with a digital camera if you use a laptop.",5,Convenient little device,997574400,"08 12, 2001",0.3899

Surkan,"[41, 46]","I plugged this adapter into my new Dell Laptop and it brought up my CompactFlash card as an additional hard drive in Windows 2000, no software or additional drivers required.I was then able to browse and even edit pictures on the card as if it were a disk drive. Truly amazing. All peripherals should be this easy to install and intuitive to use.",5,Truly plug and play...,984268800,"03 11, 2001",0.3042
2,A3VP5SXUTKJFRW,B00000J3SA,C. DeGhoul urieldewolf,"[2, 3]","CF readers with USB cords? Why bother? Say goodbye to those bothersome cords! This CF adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer PORTABLE. One little adapter allows you to plug in your Compact Flash cards for quick and easy reading. I bought this item when I purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing! It's so simple to use, light-weight, compact -- and incredibly inexpensive! How simple? Plug your CF card in one end, plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the CF card just like it was another drive. How sweet is that?",5,Inexpensive and still fantastic,1028160000,"08 1, 2002",0.1333
3,AK73Y669AMPVS,B00000J3SA,David Booker musicman,"[1, 1]",I use a viking 128Mb CompactFlash card in my Canon S200 digital camera. Simply plugging the card into this reader and the reader into the PCMCIA slot on my Mac TiBook automatically launches iPhoto and imports the contents of the card into the laptop. Much faster and certainly more elegant than carrying around cables and using the camera battery. Highly recommended!,5,Works like a charm!,1049673600,"04 7, 2003",0.2591

5,A5NXA10HTO42S,B00000J3SA,Francisco Valenzuela Paco,"[1, 1]","It works fine under Windows ME, 2000, and XP, because you dont need drivers, I read a bad review for this item, and let me tell to the autor: or you have an old windows version(98 or 95) or you need to contact support, but not for this device, you need suport for the CF card developer, because this its just an adapter.Its faster than usb readers(max 12mbps) and of course really more faster than cable connection from the device(1.2mbps), the speed limit its the speed of youre CF card(more than 12x its great).",5,Just what you buy! no more no less,1055289600,"06 11, 2003",0.7684
6,A2RB7KPCTJEP4Z,B00000J3SA,Hey Mo!!,"[2, 2]","I just plugged it in and it simply worked -- both on my PowerBook 1400 running OS 8.6 (which exploits it as an extended memory hack) and on my Titanium PowerBook running OS 9 and OS X. I have iPhoto set NOT to launch when the card is inserted on the TiBook.I gave 4 stars because it arrived quickly and did the job as advertised with no hassles. (To merit 5 stars, it should have had better documentation and a more detailed troubleshooting guide).",4,Plug and Play on the Mac,1103760000,"12 23, 2004",0.1064
7,A3UBI8XEO26P2C,B00000J3SA,J. Whiteside,"[0, 0]","This adapter works great for quickly moving digital images from cameras to your pc. The only problem I have with it relates to the overall length of the card. They should have made it 1/2 inch longer so you could remove it more easily from the PC card slot. When inserted, it is &quot;flush&quot; with the PC.",5,This will save you tons of image transfer time!,1041552000,"01 3, 2003",0.1559
8,A26624KSJ3FBMZ,B00000J3SA,Michael Baumann,"[3, 3]","It does what is says it does, the only downside I can think of is, that it does not have an eject button for the CF Card, so when the card fits tight, you have to remove the PCMCIA Card to actually get the CF card out.",4,Good device,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",-0.25
9,A3D6ITN1HM1FQG,B00000J3SA,Peter John Hill Peter,"[18, 19]","This is a great little piece of hardware. I have used mine in both a Dell Latitude running WinXP and an Apple Ti800 running Mac OS X. It is the only way I transfer pictures now. Much easier to carry than a USB cable, plus it is faster, does not use up the batteries on the camera, and just flat out works perfectly.Here is how I use it :I take my picutres (duh ;-), remove the CF card from the camera and insert it into this adapter. Then I insert it into the laptop. Under both Windows and Mac, the CF card appears as a removable drive on the computer.Under Windows, I navigate through a couple of folders to where the pictures are stored and copy them to a folder on my hard drive. On the Mac, iPhoto automatically opens up (because I have told iPhoto to startup automatically when a camera is connected) and it gets ready to transfer the pictures. I can then tell it to copy the pictures to my Photo library, and delete the originals. It does just that. Then on the Mac and PC, I tell the operating system to eject the drive/device, then I can pop the adapter out of the computer. Of course you can pop it out whenever you want, but you will definitely risk something bad, better to eject it the proper way. I can transfer a full 128 MB flash card to my computer is a minute or so. Fast enough that I haven't timed it.So, I would highly recommend this to anyone who uses CF media with a laptop. It is the way to go!...",5,"So nice, so very nice",1020816000,"05 8, 2002",0.126

I connect the camera to the laptop with a serial cable wich makes it to slow (No USB cable), so I tried this inexpensive alternative in order to revive my old camera wich still works perfectly. I needed a way to download the pictures from the CF card to the computer. Now, I can download in seconds what usually took hours.",5,Second Wind,1018137600,"04 7, 2002",0.1913

It is also much faster for me then hooking up my Digital camera to the computer using a USB cord and AC/DC adapter (saves on batteries). Faster in the hook up time and faster in downloading and uploading. I can highly recommend this product, I am very happy with it.",5,Works like a charm.,1029196800,"08 13, 2002",0.3253

Plugged it in and WinXP automatically recognized it as E drive. This adapter worked in Win2000 and Win98 as well.
