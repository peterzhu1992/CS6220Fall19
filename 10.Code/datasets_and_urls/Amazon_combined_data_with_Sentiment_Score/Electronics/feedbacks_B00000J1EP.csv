If you ar an audio purist, don't purchase this, go for the higher bias. For normal folk like me with tin-pan ears, this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price, whether that price is retail or sale.",5,Well-Known,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",0.3534

They are getting harder to locate and this brand, length and packaging are excellent. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. I might add that the box looked like it had a hard shipping experience.

5,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00000J1EP,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[6, 6]","Maxell manufactures excellent 90 minute cassette tapes for all purpose general recording. As long as you have the right kind of equipment, these tapes record the sounds of record albums, radio shows, CD-Rs, people talking and more. These tapes have 90 minutes worth of blank recording tapes on them so there are 45 blank minutes for recording on each side. The features of this tape, as one reviewer correctly notes, make it good for recording lectures and music using standard, less expensive home stereo equipment. The tape playback will work well in any basic tape deck including the one in your car.If you pay the Amazon price of $6.75 for the fifteen-pack you spend roughly 45 cents per tape and that's very inexpensive. The tapes allow you hours upon hours of listening enjoyment because you can record over them many times; and they take up very little room so they're easy to carry around with you.Unfortunately, these tapes cannot produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you. This means that if, hypothetically, you were to copy a CD-R onto another CD-R instead of a Maxell cassette tape, the quality of the sound on the CD-R copy would be sharper and clearer with less background noise than a Maxell cassette tape or any other brand of cassette tape could give you. Maxell also manufactures higher quality cassette tapes including the Maxell XL-II; but it's still not the same as a digitized CD-R recording. Moreover, cassette tapes can break if not handled with care. They can also break if used a few too many times, too. Therefore, I recommend that any important recorded material should be copied onto another blank tape and then keep that second tape in a safe place to use as a backup. These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow top of each cassette which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible. If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole. The cassette tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall, Maxell makes a great choice when you want reliable cassette tapes to record music, the radio, people talking or anything you wish to record. I have used this brand for decades and I cannot think of any major complaints. I highly recommend Maxell normal bias 90 minute cassette tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a tape.",4,fine normal bias 90 minute tape though it could stand a little improvement,1186272000,"08 5, 2007",0.2529
6,A1EE1HLYUIJPIG,B00000J1EP,MaxPower,"[0, 0]","So I acutally bought these tapes for an art project and I am not going to be using these at all. I don't even have a tape player anymore.Both projects are lamps made out of either just the cassette tapes or the tapes in their cases. Thought I would give both a try and see which I liked better.I really like the first one better, I bought different kinds of lights to try out inside the base.I have also seen people spray paint these neon colors and hang them from string in rooms, put on walls. Fun art to remember a cool time when you rewound tapes with pencils so you didn't waste batteries. :P",5,Hey you need a mix tape baby?,1341619200,"07 7, 2012",0.3738
7,A2HDTOF8222KN3,B00000J1EP,Mendy,"[0, 0]","I needed to buy cassettes elsewhere than where I was buying them from. They were getting more expensive each and every year. Luckily I thought about looking here. I found cassettes at a price from a period of many years ago. It literally brought back childhood memories, well not really, but it was very inexpensive. I still like recording on my old cassette player but found many stores not carrying cassettes on their shelves. And when they did, the prices were high. I highly recommend purchasing cassettes here on Amazon, they have many different brands to chose from.",5,"I'm glad I looked here for cassettes, found a deal here.",1363824000,"03 21, 2013",0.1728

When I played it back, it played back smoothly with no skips or tangles. I have used three or four of them without a hitch, but then I generally do rely on Maxell for my taping needs so I was not surprised. I will buy more again when I need more.",5,"Since they work beautifully, I cannot give them less than five stars",1373673600,"07 13, 2013",0.1777

Although people now use CD's, I give a taped session to my clients as a courtesy so I don't have to deal with burning CD's. Buying online is less expensive and easier to find.

This is the best price I've seen on good normal bias tapes - the chrome (high bias, Type II) are just too pricey - but these sound just fine for all my music, whether rock, jazz, country or classical. Getcha some before the Type I prices get stupid, too.
