0,AMSAQMLJKCFSB,1615527613,E. Johnson Elaine,"[0, 0]",Got this for my nook (since B&N didn't have it!) Good price and exactly what I needed. It also seems to be a better made product than the one that came with my color nook.,5,BN-ADP-h01 Power kit,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",0.2936
1,A2YSLAI9DJ32I9,1615527613,James,"[0, 0]","Bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my Nook Tablet. Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine. After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again. This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again. Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet,so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead.",2,"Expensive, breaks easily",1345420800,"08 20, 2012",0.0514
2,AZANOSUQAY5C6,1615527613,Katey Newman,"[0, 0]","I had the original adapter that came with my Nook Color for 2 years without any problems. After 2 years it finally broke, and I didn't even know people were having troubles with their chargers until I had to buy a new one. I have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again I don't seem to be having any problems with it.The original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though, which is where everyone is having problems. So I will not deny that this seems to be an issue. For that it loses a star, but because I personally haven't had any major problems with them I will still give it 4 stars.",4,I don't seem to have the same problems everyone else has,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",-0.2105

Hopefully these replacement chargers will last just as long, if not longer.",5,Just in time,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",0.2899
4,A18LJ72NBKZ6JC,1615527613,Tim,"[0, 0]",This is the third adapter that I have tried other than buying direct from B&N. This adapter is quality made and works excellent with the device. It is better made than the original. Great value.,5,Excellent adapter,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",0.4917
