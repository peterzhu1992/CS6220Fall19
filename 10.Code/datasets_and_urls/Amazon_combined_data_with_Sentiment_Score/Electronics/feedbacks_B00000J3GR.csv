1,A1QPUBF6U5EQM6,B00000J3GR,Dare2Dream,"[0, 0]","I love this! It comes with matching tags. We always have a mess of cords over by our tv. Between all the components it is iimpossible to tell what is what...not anymore. You just tag it with the matching color, up by where you plug it in. I love this, and it comes with a great warranty, which also sold me. Worth the little bit extra, IMO,",5,Works great,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",0.1981

So when I was able to see these on Amazon for less money, I was happy! They work well, they allow you to plug up many things and move freely. The cord from the power strip is average length but it does the job! I would recommend.",5,Works Well!!,1378857600,"09 11, 2013",0.4428

I use it in my office and there is enough room between each plug that it doesn't matter how big the plug next to it is, it does not interfere.I also really enjoy the design and colors. Having a quality item that also looks great it just an extra plus in my book!",5,LOVE this!,1375056000,"07 29, 2013",0.6045

6,AVH94LMMMVXSO,B00000J3GR,the 10th Weasley,"[0, 0]",This is a brilliant product. It's so helpful to not have to tug and pull and guess which cord is which. I love that they added tape so you just put matching tape on each end of the cord and pull the cord into the coordinating plug.,5,Great !,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",0.5661
7,A1IEFXS4C1TSB8,B00000J3GR,Willow,"[1, 2]",I got this strip because I was living in a mobile home and wanted to protect against surges on my computer. This did just that.,5,Great,1210636800,"05 13, 2008",0.1909
