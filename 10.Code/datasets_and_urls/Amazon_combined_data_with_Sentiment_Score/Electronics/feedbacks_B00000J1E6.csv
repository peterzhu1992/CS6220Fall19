They totally scratch the CD.The Step 1: Scratch Removal is not scratch removal at all. It is supposed to sit for 5 minutes, then you wipe it. I let it sit overnite once and the scratch was still there.After you apply that junk, the instructions say to apply Step 2: Cleaner,Polisher, and Sealer. This stuff is practically water. It doesn't work AT ALL.After you do that the CD should be like new. I don't think so!The holder that you put the CD on while you're cleaning it is too flimsy.The only good thing that I use the Scratch Remover for is small scratches on my digital camera, cell phone, PSP, and other electronics.Do not buy this unless you like ruining CD's.Last Word:I hate Maxell.",1,"This won't fix the Cd's, it will ruin them",1121817600,"07 20, 2005",0.03
1,AFNCXMCX7VZWH,B00000J1E6,J. Jongeling slice of heaven,"[0, 1]","After reading the reviews on here I was hesitant to use the product I had just purchased. But I figured what could I lose - it was already skipping and if this didn't work, I'd just buy a new copy.Well I'm here to tell you that if you plan to use this on anything important, forget it. The CD was left with more scratches than before (the protective pad actually MAKES scratches WORSE than a paper towel...) and it's just a horrible product. I followed the directions to a T. Thanks Maxell for wasting my money and my time.",1,Just awful,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",-0.3948

It did take a couple applications, but the sections where the DVD would stop and shut off, now play continuously through. Make sure to follow the directions and wipe as the instructions say and the disc will work fine after everything dries.",5,It works,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",0.0441

After I was done, I had even more scratches and the movie skipped in the exact spot it did before.",1,"Creates new scratches, didn't fix the old ones",1157587200,"09 7, 2006",0.0

5,A850S0PK7OMFU,B00000J1E6,t00nz,"[26, 27]","Been using this stuff for a couple years. Works great for me. I use it different than the instruction. Find a flat surface, lay a bundle of tissue on it, place the disk scratched face up. Place a couple drops of #1 abrasive on the disk and immediately start wiping with some pressure radially outward (you don't have to wait 5 minutes). Keep working your way around the disk until the solution is dry (about 5 minutes). Spray once with #2, and using a clean TISSUE, continue wiping VERY GENTLY radially outward until #2 dries. Try the disk. If it doesn't work, repeat all the above until it does. This really does work, but it can take some elbow grease and repeated tries depending on the severity of the scratches. I've had a LOT of scratched disks, and I haven't found one yet that I couldn't fix with this.",5,Works great for me.,1198713600,"12 27, 2007",0.133
6,A37WWMRMNR2KSA,B00000J1E6,VK,"[0, 2]","This product is crap. I followed the instructions to the tiniest detail (I am a very methodical person) and it didn't remove the scratch that my DVD has and it added several more. I read other reviews of people who had a good experience by twisting the instructions, but I am not willing to do that; the manufacturer should know better how to make this product work. Following the instructions, it ruins your CD or DVD even further. Don't wast you time, money and your CD / DVD and take it somewhere where they can buff it.",1,It doesn't work and adds scratches,1260316800,"12 9, 2009",0.0206
