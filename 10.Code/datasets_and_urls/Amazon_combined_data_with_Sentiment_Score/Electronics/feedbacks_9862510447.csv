1,A1CW4FAG34ENZO,9862510447,KamikaziH2Omln,"[0, 0]","This microphone does what it states, but nothing more. It does record sound, and that can be very handy for an iDevice, but at the cost of the external speakers (if it has one) being shut off. The original reason I bought this was for the use of Skype, but I can't due to the speakers getting shut off. Also, the size can be helpful (not a obstruction), but it is also easily losable.PROS-Records sounds-Compact**CONS-No speaker when in use-CompactIn the end, buy this if you need it for the voice memos, shazam, an certain voice apps, but with other applications, such as Skype,this won't do very well.",3,Good for what it is,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",0.1977

Sellers say you have to purchase an additional app, but mine works fine with the included 'Memo' app on my iPod Touch 2G.
