0,AYC7L2YJMZOOC,1400699169,"[0, 0]","A year after Barnes and Noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the Nook HD+ 9 is still one of the best values in the tablet market. The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9. First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display. You will note that by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9. In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode. The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat. These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20. So for a reasonable price one can get a rooted android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.This tablet was originally released in November of 2012. It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8 that was released in a few months later in mid 2013. The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics. It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8 and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8. They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear. The Nook has neither of these features. But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network. Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects. The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here. They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available. I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.",5,Great Value!

1,A393VR8USGJSEO,1400699169,"[11, 13]","Look folks this is not a $400 IPAD or Samsung. If you want a wizbang then you don't want the Nook HD. For me it fit all my needs without needing a loan to buy one. I ordered my direct from B & N for $179.00. It came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color. It is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but, at the same time can pick what you want that they have. No need to repurchase what they already have.What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon). I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.Lets not forget its a 9 in screen. Battery holds well at 10 hours.I bought a 32GB SD card and so far have put 15 movies ( and stiil room for many more) on the card to watch in HD. I choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny SD micro card. Buy DVD Catalyst ( really cool program for $9.95)(can try it for free)on line to compress those movies from DVD and then it automatically puts it on the micro card.I seen some gripes about them adding Google store. Not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T ADD ANY GOOGLE APPS. Its still a free country.So for reading ebooks, movies, games, apps and many others all for $179.00, for me it hit my tickle spot. I gave it four stars instead of 5 because it did not have a camera, crappy speaker on the back instead of single or dual on the front. And the power cord is just too expensive for a crummy cable.",4,Very pleased. Its not an IPAD.,1376265600,"08 12, 2013",Amazon Customer,0.1044
2,A3GKRQWPAIZR3L,1400699169,"[2, 4]","I've bought a few Nooks over the years and have always loaded CyanogenMod (plain Android) off an SD card (and a few times on the actual device).The HD+ is no exception. As long as you understand that it doesn't have a camera, its powerful and inexpensive. It even comes with Google Play! East your hear out Kindle users!Up for your own project? Head over to the XDA developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of Android either right on the device or run it off a microSD card.Great screen, fast processor. This thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and Android OS!",5,What more can you ask for?,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",Amazon Customer I am sflesch,0.1546
3,A2IQSNBMGS45X9,1400699169,"[0, 0]","Well, I bought it because of the 1080p resolution. The screen quality is beautiful. I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price. After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system. Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move. The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat. With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store. With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free. I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something. With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter. I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS. I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s. With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities. You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card. The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet. One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS. If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad. By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook. One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.",5,Well worth every penny if rooted with Kit Kat,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",Annie Wong,0.2869

5,A3PD8JD9L4WEII,1400699169,"[57, 59]","Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+A new winner in the best value in a mid-size Android tablet category.When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N; ecosystem. Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved. (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy! But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home. If not, you may be surprised to find the combined reader and Android tablet interface pretty nice. It's well thought out and for the most part works very well. Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if it. Don't miss the Nook Today icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked. All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change. (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just back but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can override the Nook UI and install other launchers but I, personally, felt no need to do so. But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky). The 8-9 range seems to be the sweet spot. The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness. Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great. The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion. Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet. Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it. It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on. The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful. This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go. I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well. Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course. The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use. The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets. The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster. The handy HOME button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might. I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy. For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM. Not cutting edge, but plenty fast. Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice soft touch feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well. Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+. Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well. It's all here and well integrated. Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases. (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No! It did not work at all. Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine. So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine. Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected. The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally. Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept! ;)The Nook HD+ is a sleeper - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.

8,AXJ1QYBUL86ON,1400699169,"[0, 4]","I bought this Nook HD+ in the summer for $179 from BestBuy. It seemed like the best value at the time for a 32GB tablet.I thought that it would be good for our trip to Spain. We ended up using it to watch a few movies on the plane and that was it.Fast forward a few months of neglecting using the Nook and the device will not even turn on. I keep thinking that I am doing something wrong, but the next step is most likely going to be a trip to BestBuy after I confirm that I ordered the extended warranty (it's been a busy time for us!).So needless to say I am not impressed....UPDATE:Well, the Nook decided to Power on again when I followed the instructions to turn on a dead Nook. I don't have the instructions right here, but if you find them (has to do with pressing and holding two of the buttons at the same time), make sure to look at your screen very carefully because one of the options is to restore your Nook to factory settings - and you won't want to do that if you have anything stored on it.I will just have to see how it goes.Wish Amazon Instant Video would play on it, but RedBox now offers an $8 monthly subscription rate for 4 dvds at the kiosk and unlimited streaming.That along with NetFlix give me two options for streaming video.",3,Dead in the water!,1388016000,"12 26, 2013",HWWoman HWWoman,0.0695
9,A2SBFXPN5V6A6X,1400699169,"[10, 18]","Having all the iPad models, 9 different Android models, I can say this tablet overall is a bit disappointing. I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7 tablets. The most significant issue with these tablets is the B&N; version of an already outdated Android OS_Ice Cream Sandwich, not the latest Jelly Bean which is far far better. It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7 tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models.
