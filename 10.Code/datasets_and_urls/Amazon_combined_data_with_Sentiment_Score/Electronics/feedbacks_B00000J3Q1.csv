1,ASWYSSKL9LL9X,B00000J3Q1,amazonreader,"[18, 20]","This slim case will give your palm quite an elegant touch. It is also lightweight and compact, and it will store your Palm, as well as some business cards and/or credit cards. I personally preffer the hard cover, which has a more modern look and protects the Palm better. Nonetheless, I use the slim leather case when I go to elegant social events because it is slimmer and less heavy, so it is easier to carry in your coat pocket.",4,Elegant and practical,948931200,"01 27, 2000",0.6033

The combination of the two is terrific-- performance and looks.There is one problem with turning the power but a software hack fixes this.A great gift idea for an intelligent businessman or woman. The more you use these t devices the more you will come to depend on them.If you want to use this as a wallet, it is a good option. I like to keep my wallet trimmed down without a lot of junk. This is not a real wallet so you can't accumulate junk in here.The Palm Vx complements this in that you can quickly enter whatever receipt information you might normally accumulate in your wallet-auto records, expenses, etc. And toss those out or if you want to keep them dump in a monthly file folder.I strongly recommend the combination of this wallet and the Vx.",5,A great case that doubles as a wallet,967593600,"08 30, 2000",0.3649

6,A3W112102BC6BG,B00000J3Q1,J. Lara,"[16, 16]","This was the first case that i had for my Palm. There is no doubt that it a good case and it looks really nice with the Vx. With the case on, it very little to the overall size of the palm. The silo design of the Vx which allows you to attach the case to the palm was ingenious. It a huge leap in case design compared to the velcro concept of may PDA's.As for this case it is made of high quality leather and it a loop/strap design that i also liked. Velcro and the button proved that after prolonged use, it tends to rip. The loop/strap design secures the case very well and it still looks very elegant.However like many leather products, they tend to warp and deform after a while. Just think of your wallet and how deformed that can get. If your going to be putting it in your pocket a lot, i suggest you go with the hard case. However if your going to be putting it in a bag or brief case, then this case will be fine.Although the case has slots for credit cards or business cards, realistically you wouldnt want to put more than two credit card and 3 business cards in it at one time. It does a lot to the bulkiness of the case. Personally I only carried 4 business cards in it at one time.Reatively speaking i wanted a case that was smaller then this one because it got a little too big for my pockets, whether it be the shirt or pant pocket. i found that not only was the hardcase by palm smaller and almost weighed as much, it also protected it just as well.Also the fact that the powerbutton was often times turn on when using the leather case convinced me to change to the hard case.Dont get me wrong. I really like this case. The hard case just fit my needs for a case a lot better then the slim leather case.The best thing i can suggest is to try both of them out before you actually buy it. A lot of stores will let you try on the case. Thats really the best way to determine which one will really work for you.I wonder if this will fit the m500 series... hmmm....",4,Excellent product but there are others out there!,985478400,"03 25, 2001",0.2969
7,A8TZ88OM8YOLW,B00000J3Q1,MartyHansen,"[13, 13]","As a heavy user of my Palm (which I access dozens of times a day), the Palm Slim Leather Case is perfect for my needs. I prefer it over other cases for the following reasons:The first is portablity. I take my Palm everywhere with me (even to the little boy's room). And with the case's slim size, my Palm fits easily into my front pants pocket. (Carrying my Palm in my shirt pocket is also an option. But since my company switched to business casual attire, I no longer wear dress shirts with pockets to work. Hooray!)The second reason is convenience. With the Palm rail system, the unit is held securely. And when I need to sync, the case slides off cleanly (the rail system being a simpler and much more elegant solution than the pocket or Velcro holding methods of other products).The third reason is protection. The rigid cover is slightly padded, and the loop closure is very secure. (Before adopting this case, I once used another cover -- without a loop closure -- which failed to protect my Palm when I accidentally dropped it in the street while I waited on the curb for a cab.) The loop closure is also easy to open, so access to my Palm is not restricted.My last reason for selecting this case is its ability to hold business cards. I put my business cards (a whole slew of them) in the large inside pocket, and I put my kids' doctor and dentist appointment reminders in the multiple credit card slots, none of which I want to carry in my wallet (which is already filled with plenty of other stuff). Since my Palm is always with me, I'm never without a business card, so I never miss an opportunity to have my name remembered by the many new customers or vendors I meet.(As a comparison, many of the hard cases are very stylish. But since they can't carry business cards, they aren't really adequate for my needs.)For a great combination of style and function that's perfect for a heavy Palm user like me -- the Palm Slim Leather Case is ideal!",5,Great Features -- And It Holds Business Cards Too!,1000425600,"09 14, 2001",0.2007
8,A6ZPLVAUQ6695,B00000J3Q1,neurotome neurotome,"[24, 27]","I got this case because I had two needs. I wanted to protect my Palm V from the frequent falls out of my front coat pocket; but I didn't want to significantly increase its size and weight.This case fits both bills nicely. The added bulk and texture of the leather holds the Palm in your pocket for that split second necessary to grab it before it falls; and when it does fall, even if it lands on a corner, the screen doesn't crack. Just what this doctor ordered.I use the pockets to store a couple of cards, nothing more. Works like a charm. The clasp is sort of odd, just a tab of leather slipping into a buckle. A snap or velcro would have been nicer, but so far it does hold closed on its own.The leather smells nice and has been wearing well. The little Palm logo embossed on the front is sort of cute, too.

10,AM4ZQJ0IORVWG,B00000J3Q1,Rob Revuman,"[43, 44]","Unlike my other reviews which usually take up a page or so, this product is rather straight forward. First and foremost I must say that this case sure beats the hell out of the hard case, which is also manufactured by 3Com, in both form and function. Second it can hold credit cards and money to be used as a second wallet, although it is not a great idea to use it as a primary substitute. And thirdly, the hard case is about ten dollars more than the leather case and is not nearly as good.However, like all things, it does have it's downsides. It's biggest flaw, like with other cases, is that it makes placing the Palm in the craddle (while still in the case) a little more difficult. You basically need to place the craddle up on something (upside-down cup for example) and pull back both sides of the case all the way and then you can recharge. Secondly, the pockets are made so stiff inside that it is very tricky to get both money or credit cards into or out of the pockets, which is why you might want to stick to a regular wallet. And thirdly, if you place the cased palm in a tight space like a bag or something, there is a chance that the edge of the case will hit the power button and cause it to turn on. This is not a big deal since it will shut off automatically after a minute or so, however it can become annoying when you haven't charged your palm in a while and you find that your battery is dying for some strange reason.All in all, you can't do much better than this case for only $19.95, and while there may be more expensive cases on the market, they are all variations of this simple design. However, I would say that it would be nice it 3Com or Palm would make a case like this that went all the way around the palm for protection on all sides, since something can get caught between your palm and the case and end up scratching the screen (which almost happened to me).Final thoughts: nice leather, don't expect it to take the same beating as the hard case, but unless you plan to go hiking with your palm, don't shovel out the extra ten bucks for a shoddy hard case, get this nice leather one instead.Revuman: Stay Tuned for more Reviews...peace!",4,"Nice case, OK wallet, better than the hard case",958262400,"05 14, 2000",0.0643

12,AGVB3UZIPFHEF,B00000J3Q1,Sheldon,"[13, 14]","One of the nice features of the Palm V is its slim size. If the manufacturer of this case would leave out the credit card/cash pockets, it would definitely be a plus.I have not had the accidental turn on problems others have had, but I think when the case softens up a bit after use this could be a serious issue.
