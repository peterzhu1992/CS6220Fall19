I found these in red, blue, and yellow on Amazon, they are different colors and legnths. I wish they made 10-15ft in colors. That would be great.

3,A1IDWUYX4QXTUE,B00000J1UY,Leslie,"[0, 0]","When I rearranged my office I discovered the power cord from my computer monitor would no long reach my battery backup. An extension cord was needed. I have used Belkin products before and have always been satisfied so I didn't hesitate to order this online. I received it in only a few days and it worked perfectly. The plug ends fit snuggly and the picture on the monitor is as good as it was before I added the extension cord. And at a great price, too.",5,Perfect!
