1,ANWZYGU6HFYM9,B00000J3WQ,Angel E. Yerovi Lopez Angel Yerovi,"[1, 2]","I bought this product veeeery long time ago and never used till 4 moths ago. I bought in 2009 and I used on september 2012. for first time because I needed. I had a very % dollars cheap ruler extension same like this but cheap. I needed this for split the power overloading on my other extension, because the other one when overloaded pops up the switch and turns off, so i split the power and it was everything ok, and then this surge arrest protector starts burning inside and smelling to burnt plastic. Me and my roomate saw it and yes, the power cable was hot as hell as it might be on for hours at full capacity and then the inside of the surge arrest start somking so we unpluged, and if it wasnt because of the fact we were there and realized this happen, what if we just leave and leave this protector running, I am sure we might found a big fire when we might come back. In other words I had to put this in trash because it has no such a protection, my 5 dollar protector extension workd better than this pice of samples_data_script.sh because that one when it is over loaded automatically pops up the power button and turns off but dont got burnt. BE CAREFULL PELASE AND SAVE MONEY. Just keep an eye on this, if you use normally might work fine but if you kind of overload with too much electric devices all of them runing this will NOT PROTECT INSTEAD THIS WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE Try by yourself if not beleive it. if this might be a trully protector might turn it off automatically when overload but this keeps running till gots on fire.",1,CERO STARS MIGHT BE BETTER PLEASE DONT BUY,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",-0.1825
2,A1U9EJYPPU0VA4,B00000J3WQ,Daniel Carter,"[7, 8]","I used my 8-outlet SurgeArrest protector to protect my home office equipment. One day, POOF went my computer during a quick power outage. The incoming power surge when the power came back on was too much for APC to handle.Sent my unit in for eval, as they request. They said that since there was no evidence of a failure of their product, they would NOT compensate me for my power supply and motherboard being fried.Are they too dense to understand that if their product fails to stop a surge, it may be a case of the MOVs NOT blowing? MOVs are designed to take the hit and suffer the damage, protecting your electronics from the surge. Their device failed to stop a surge, failing to protect my equipment!My advice - if your equipment and data are valuable to you, then purchase one of the series-based surge protectors (APC does not make these). As they say, you get what you pay for. Except with APC, who fail to honor their warranties.For those who insist on using cheap surge protectors, I hope you protect your vehicles with a good set of Deer Whistles. Same sales principle - make them cheap enough for everyone, spin a marketing campaign stating they do the job, then rake in the profits while benefiting from consumers who will either not report a failure, or who will whimper quietly off into the sunset without complaining or sharing their experiences with the worthless product. If APC sold Deer whistles, and a deer hits your car, they would avoid fulfilling their warranty because the whistles are not defective.The product may not have failed mechanically or electronically, but it certainly FAILED to provide protection.

4,A1VBFJXCQ3AK30,B00000J3WQ,MAH,"[1, 4]","The point of purchasing the APC surge protector was to increase the safety for my equipment and home.Now the company has recalled their older products (Ours was purchased in March 2010)due to potential fires during very unusual conditions. Instead of more safety, we had less.This is unacceptable for this type of product and causes concern about my other APC surge protector that I purchased later but was not in the recall. Does the later product not have the same problem or has it not been out long enough for customers to report problems? I chose to avoid the possible risk and to replace it with a different brand.Also unacceptable is the only recourse for the consumer is to apply for a newer model. A better company would have offered a full refund option.Needless to say, I will not be purchasing any more APC products.",1,Recalled Oct. 2013 - Purchased March 2010.

6,A3QBHMMDRSC5VY,B00000J3WQ,M. J. Mccaffrey Matt OneLANE,"[29, 29]","APC (which by the way is American Power Conversion, not American Power Conservation as amazon.com currently shows it) has always been serious about clean power. This is no ordinary surge protector. It has more heavy-duty protection features and absorbs more joules of surge energy than you're ever likely to see. But what I like is the intelligent layout of the outlets ... with my ADSL modem, I now have three huge wall warts to deal with. The PRO8T2 handles them well, and manages another smaller one in the top tier of outlets. A large green light lets me know it's working. And the switch guard is removable -- if you WANT to be able to turn this unit on and off with your toe, APC made that possible, and they call out the feature in the instructions. You can spend $20 for a much less capable power station, or a few bucks more for one that will take care of your stuff. APC delivers the latter with this unit.",5,Sort out your blocks,963964800,"07 19, 2000",0.2852

After my Belkin protector broke after a direct lightning hit on my house, I purchased this item. The equipment I had plugged into the Belkin model did not survive the direct hit. The other model of APC I had did protect my iMac. I will never pruchase another Belkin again. Belkin is cheaper, but you get what you pay for.
