James,"[1, 5]","At a much lower cost than many cost this does the job very well if you want to do extended work with your Garmin GPS away from a car, like when I was adding all my addresses to it.",5,"Great Price, does the job for Garmin GPS 1490LMT",1291420800,"12 4, 2010",0.4576

3,A1LKXQNNHK1NMO,9984984362,Jim Costello,"[0, 0]",This unit works as advertised. Not the best charger I have ever used but not the worst. It allows me to keep my Garmin topped off with power prior to embarking on a trip. (Could be real useful if you use your GPS city feature to explore an urban landscape by foot.) All in all this unit has performed to expectations and is small enough to store with my other GPS accessories.,3,Not a Bad Little Charger,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",0.1888

Very happy with my purchase. I've had the item for over 2 years now and it still charges perfectly. Trust Amazon's sellers on items like this.",5,"Excellent wall/AC home charger, low price",1345680000,"08 23, 2012",0.6289
