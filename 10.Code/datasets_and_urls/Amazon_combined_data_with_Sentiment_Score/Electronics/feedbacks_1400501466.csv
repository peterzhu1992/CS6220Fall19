0,A3LDPF5FMB782Z,1400501466,Alan Houston,"[3, 4]","The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012. Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a Brand X color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as Automobile or National Geographic.Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines pop even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special text only option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook shop does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get right, but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the book world and the video world. The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a book of the day for adults and a book of the day for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was Mary Poppins, a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.",5,The BEST Color E-Reader - With Bonus Features,1336003200,"05 3, 2012",0.437

6,A2UL4M5SXL7L0A,1400501466,basieswings,"[11, 11]","I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more manly looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!",5,"Excellent hardware, boot from SD for full tablet functionality",1342310400,"07 15, 2012",0.0899
7,A2XIOXRRYX0KZY,1400501466,B.L.,"[0, 0]","When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.",3,"Decent Little Reader, Poor Tablet",1371686400,"06 20, 2013",0.4116

11,A2FHM5FB0BXKGA,1400501466,"Dr. Elaine O. Chaika book, movie, tech lover","[17, 19]","Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member. Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet. To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store. BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com. This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that. There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook. Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book. I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have. However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for My Stuff so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it. Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures. For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app. I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire. However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012. Then came days of comparing them side by side. You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook? First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times. Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook. Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features. Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too. However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99. Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, Wow! it's as good as the Sony! Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies. Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me. B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free. Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free. They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books. You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text. Some of the old books are also Enhanced. Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined. You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka. You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to. In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web. You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook. Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is not enough for you, you can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all! If you're App happy, you can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty. I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week. Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet. Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail. She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook. I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does have both. If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook. The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is. I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device. Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix. There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops. Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive. It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on. Notice, it displays page numbers, not locations like the Fire. If you can't remember who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly. Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.) The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up. The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites. For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen. My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me. Of course, I choose those that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had. Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover. This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive. Actually, everything it does do, it does very well. It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad. As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's. The iPad3 will have hi def, however.",5,Outstanding 7 Tablet,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",0.23

It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing.

14,A6VFSC0BW75Y0,1400501466,Frederick J. Haab,"[5, 5]","I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November. I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet. I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors. That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it. I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store. What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present). For the most part, she was satisfied with it. I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program). The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps. The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good. Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started. My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times. The built in email application absolutely sucks. You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want. We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app. B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps. Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them. They all downloaded except one stubborn one. That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well). I sent an email to technical support and received the usual we got your request and will reply as soon as possible message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests. That was a week ago and we still have not heard back. After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help. Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process). This book still will not load.We finally side loaded the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?). After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance. That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to root products like these (especially since they aren't mine, as I won't be the one using them). As the guy, it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it). It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to. We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties. I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big n button on the Nook). It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed). I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them. They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try. If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it. Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag. I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large. Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the tablet part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too. I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading). Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the expert at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either. The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content. Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET. It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.",2,"People shouldn't be surprised about what it is, but still disappointing.",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",0.1652
15,AQNEQQ96MKX3Y,1400501466,Gojira Neko (godzilla cat) widowpress,"[6, 6]","I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.",4,GREAT .cbz (comic file) reader an more!,1330300800,"02 27, 2012",0.3333

(They also make a version with a larger screen, the HD+)Also note that there are third party programs available which will allow you to boot a rooted Android system off of an SD card. This will give more options but I found the original Nook Tablet to be sluggish running off such a card--possibly because I also went to Jelly Bean and this might have been too much for the older tablet.

Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion.

Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this). Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7. In general I like it better than CM7. My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS. Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior. I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card. Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below. Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3. Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested. I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:- Read ebooks purchased from B&N;- Browse the web on a tablet- Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:- Buy a full selection of games/apps- Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.- Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.- Play mpeg videos- Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device. I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it. This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7 Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011. She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot. A deal-breaker. This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc. Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look. Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well. Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB. The rest is for B&N-purchased; content. 1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video. A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.- BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.- Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available- Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.- Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software. I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds. While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it. I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used. U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white. The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free. Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market. The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized. I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out. They had the same issue. TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time. I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine. They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like &lt;, say, and it'll go back a track. This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos. These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player. MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either. For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market). This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button. Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android. They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device. Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout. Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen. Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say. BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable. It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger. With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage. If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to. Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging. I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates. U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update. Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI. Doing so from the web is also very fast. A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce. This is good for cooking! U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250. It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price. Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7 tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.",1,Very Limited Unless You Modify It,1325462400,"01 2, 2012",0.1561
37,A3PIPAS3M7YLQC,1400501466,Stuart,"[3, 3]","I own the original Nook e-ink reader and the Nook tablet. I have been happy with both. When I read all the wonderful reviews about the Nook HD+ I couldn't wait to buy one. The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type. The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome. I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike. The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement. However, there are several problems with the current edition:There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end. I had to choose between too small and too large.The sound level was too low, even with headphones. I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume. There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.So, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store. When planning future upgrades. I would advise Barnes & Noble to consider the needs of older customers and people with disabilities.

IF you compare this with Amazon's Fire, it's a closer comparison. Frankly, this is better than Fire. Hands down, NT has better hardware specs and it shows when you start browsing internet with heavy imagery or picture ebooks or emags. The complaints about NT's wall-garden OS restriction is very true...so is Amazon's Fire!It's not the end of the world, just root the device and you have in hand a functional tablet for $250 that is rather spiffy. This doesn't get a 5-star rate because 7-inch form factor is the biggest drawback compare to the OS lockdown. Personally, 7-in tablets is too small for serious computing usage. It is a good reading form factor though. I can't give this a 4-star rate because B&N;'s app store is too small...even when rooted, Google's Market Place is filled with crappy-junk apps.",3,It's a entry-level tablet for $250,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",0.0367
