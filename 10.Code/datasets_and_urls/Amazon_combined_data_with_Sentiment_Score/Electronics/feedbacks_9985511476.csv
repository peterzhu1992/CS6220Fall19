6,AK2XW27R76ZTC,9985511476,GrumpyOldMan,"[0, 0]","I bought two of these for use with two Garmin nuvi 1450 units. In my opinion, it is unfortunate that the Garmin nuvi 1450 requires extra storage capacity to handle updates; I think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the United States and Canada. I don't know yet whether I am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and I don't know whether a bigger card is available.",4,It works.,1390780800,"01 27, 2014",0.0911

I use them on my GPS, HD video camera, Samsung tablet, laptops and including my desktop. I do not remember one failing me as they are totally reliable. That is important to me as I handle them a lot...back and forth from my laptop and my other electronic equipment for my music, my guitar recordings, lyrics....etc. I have not hesitation to recommend them highly to others.",5,Kingston Micro SD Card,1361923200,"02 27, 2013",0.1938

I had a 2GB Micro SD card installed in the Nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update, but it would never complete the download. On an off chance I ordered this Micro SD and it worked perfectly the first time. I have no idea why the old card would not work, but now it doesn't matter. For the low price and free shipping, this is a great deal.",5,Fixed my update problem with Nuvi 1450,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",0.2442

13,A27POUEZJP2IDM,9985511476,mnlop,"[0, 1]","Got this for my Garmin nuvi. I understand the original use of card was for portable devices. Nevertheless, it is too small and easy to lose. Now I have to lug around this slightly larger SD card to adapt it to my PC. I'll probably lose it before the next time I try to update the software on the really tiny card.

Any time I use her camera, I swap out the memory card so my pictures are not on her card. She has about 3000 pictures on her card and uses her camera with that card as a portable photo album. This card is so inexpensive that I use one to back up her photos even though I have never had one of these cards fail.",5,Works great,1398556800,"04 27, 2014",0.0138
