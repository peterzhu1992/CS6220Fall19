1,A2DLK5KEQU4TX9,9966338926,KB7RKY,"[1, 2]","Cord worked great for awhile, but had recently not been working up to snuff. Can't understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months. It should last a lot longer than that. Won't keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station. Switched back to the OEM cable, and what do you know? It's charging again.Definitely going to have to find a different cable.EDIT 10/1/2013: Nope, the cable is fine. It works great as an OTG cable...I was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone, as well as add files to my Nexus 7. It was actually the cheaply-made $9 Chinese charger I had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad. When I put this cable on my Nexus' OEM charger, it worked just fine. I do believe I'll be purchasing another Nexus 7 OEM charger in the near future.",5,Worked for awhile...can't understand how it went bad,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",0.0447
2,A3GR935UY6LX03,9966338926,Marrielle,"[0, 0]",Described as a better cable than the one that came with the Tablet. Not so! Mini USB doesn't fit and cord is very short. Sending it back ASAP.,1,Google Nexus 7 charging cable,1396137600,"03 30, 2014",0.0412
3,A3CZV7DEX2ARGE,9966338926,Mystery Maven Lefty39,"[14, 14]","Original Review: This cable does the job but beware if you are looking for anything longer than the ASUS brand cable that came with the Nexus 7 It's the same length. But the price is right and the cable seems sturdy enough.Update: We recently made a trip and I took this cable along, along with the original ASUS charger. Big mistake! As noted in other reviews the cable was incredibly slow in charging my Nexus 7. I left it plugged in overnight and it was only at 22% the next morning. When I returned home I tried the charger with this cable and found that after 10 minutes the batter charge increased from 85% to 86%. Using the same charger and the original ASUS cable for the same 10 minutes, the battery had increases from 86% to 89%. I left the Nexus 7 connected to the charger with the ASUS cable and it reached 100% charge after about an hour.The cable works fine for copying music and image files back and forth from my PC but it is sorely deficient as a charger cable. Ergo the downgrade in my rating from 4 to 2 stars.",2,"Not so good cable, 40 long - update",1361750400,"02 25, 2013",0.1066

Not a big issue considering the price.Google is selling those for way too much, they will not get my money for such overpriced item.",4,ok,1376524800,"08 15, 2013",0.3548
6,A1VKA5J3NF7OU9,9966338926,Trey,"[1, 1]","This cable is fine, except for the fact that there is no rigid construction to keep the male end from bending. I dropped my nexus 7 from a height of 1 foot onto my bed and it bent about 45. Your best bet is the official nexus 7 charger, but beware, the USB and the cable have almost entirely seperated on the cable that came with my Nexus 7.",1,Micro USB end breaks,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",0.2237
