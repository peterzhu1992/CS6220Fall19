2,A680RUE1FDO8B,B000001OMI,Jerry Saperstein,"[4, 5]","Obviously these headphones are not for the audiophile. Nor are they for the person who expects anything they buy to last for a decade or more.These headphones are for the person who wants tolerably decent sound reproduction in a compact package. Commuters, some travelers and others with modest expectations will love these. They fold into a pretty small package that can be tucked into a somewhat large package or a fanny pack or backback or mesenger bag or what have you. The headband has a wide range of adjustment and maintains the position you set it in.The earphones are large enough to cover most ears and are comfortable for extended wear. (I've been wearing them while sitting at the computer for the laat five hours without any discomfort.)If you don't demand much in the way of bass or treble, the audio range is acceptable. As I said, these headphones are not intended for audiophiles. That said, distortion isn't a problem even with the audio cranked up.These headphones don't pretend to be noise-cancelling. They are just nice average headphones with adequate audio response and the added benefit of folding into a manageably small form factor. They are sturdy within a limited degree and should last for several months. Considering their price, the need to replace them from time to time is hardly a pain.Overall, a good value as long as you don't demand or expect more than the product can deliver.Jerry",5,Excellent day-to-day headphones,1227744000,"11 27, 2008",0.3307
3,A37NP1T8KCEMOW,B000001OMI,K. Decker codgus,"[0, 0]","These headphones are perfect for the walking iPod/iPhone listener. No buds in ear, no strand ear canal. I use other headphones but these are good, like the fold in ear pads. Cord could be about 6&#34; longer, but still okay.",4,Simple.,1387065600,"12 15, 2013",0.2927
4,A28OZBLQKKYGOR,B000001OMI,Kenneth W. Weigel,"[0, 0]","Another good buy. Again, very affordable, and they work. Far less expensive than buying them in a drugstore.

6,ALHWZSTAELK9I,B000001OMI,Scott,"[0, 0]","I have several pairs of another brand for my classroom and they're pretty good. I bought this one to compare and it just feels a little cheap. Considering that I buy a pair every month or so, I'll try some other brands.",4,Feel a little cheap,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",0.2423
7,A32I07L6RTFMUA,B000001OMI,Shari,"[2, 3]","I'm not a fussy headphone buyer. I like 'em simple and cheap, so long as they get the job done.Sound Quality: Well, they sound good to me. I've had some headphones sound tinny or &#34;weird&#34;, but these sound pretty normal. Mind you, I'm certainly no audiophile and I abhor &#34;bass&#34; in my music and whatnot, so take that into consideration. For basic computer usage and pop music, these sound perfectly fine.Comfort: Actually, these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn. I get headaches if I wear a pair of headphones for too long, due to the pressure on my head. I also can't wear headbands for the same reason. These headphones are so lightweight and flexible that I can barely tell I'm wearing them - and so far, no headaches, even though I've worn them for some longer periods than I normally wear headphones.Overall, I'd say I'm surprisingly impressed with these headphones. I got them expecting the usual cheap headphones I buy (the brand changes, since I just buy the cheapest 'phones I can find by a brand I've actually heard of) and was pleasantly surprised by the comfort and quality of these headphones. I haven't had them for long, so I can't speak to the endurance of them, but even if they only last a short bit, I think I'd actually just replace them with these same ones. They're really that comfortable.",5,Great Cheap Headphones,1382832000,"10 27, 2013",0.2895
8,A3OLAZKM77XR6P,B000001OMI,Tennis Ace,"[2, 3]","I bought these headphones at a Tower Records about 2 years ago. They are nice in that you can fold them and put them in a big pocket or purse and carry them to the gym. Today I couldn't hear anything out of the right side so I'll need to toss them. I was shopping around on Amazon and noticed the other review with the similar problem so I thought I'd add to it, seeing that it may be a common problem with this model. I had only paid around $10-$15 in the first place.",3,Foldable but didn't last long,1198454400,"12 24, 2007",-0.0301
