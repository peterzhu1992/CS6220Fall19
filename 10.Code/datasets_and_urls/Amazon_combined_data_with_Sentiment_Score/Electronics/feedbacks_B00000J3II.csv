0,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00000J3II,Acute Observer,"[2, 2]","Iomega ZIP 100 Drive Parallel PortThis device has been in use since the mid-1990s. It allows both storage and transfer since it works on any parallel port, which should be defined as bi-directional or EPP. For best results, you should run the Parallel Port Accelerator program when the unit is connected. Computers have a limit on the number of IDE devices, and desktop computers have a limited number of bays. The disks are easily replaced to provide vast storage within the 100Mb limit. This device must be connected when all power is off, like with a parallel port printer. Backing up a small amount of data is not a problem, but large amount of data files will run slowly. The fastest transfer is with an internal IDE ZIP device.The User's Manual warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega Copy Machine program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega Format function. Use Short Format to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The Long Format repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. Write Protection protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as non-removable so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details. Most printers will operate from the printer port on this unit. The manual offers suggestions if this doesn't work.Parallel Port drives have their drive letter(s) assigned after the hard drive. Another Parallel Port unit can be connected to the first (daisy chaining). This changes the drive letter(s) assigned to CD-roms. A USB drive has its drive letter assigned after the CD-rom drive letter(s). Both units have been proven useful over time. Will the data on a disk survive for over a decade? Not with some floppy disks. Few hard drives survive 10 years of daily use. All your important data files should be copied from a hard drive to ZIP drives or other media. ZIP drives, like floppies, should not be exposed to magnetic fields or high heat. CDs can be damaged by high heat. ZIP disks are reusable, replacing data does not decrease the size. A CD disk consumes space when a file is replaced. Both can have labels. Some say ZIP drives are obsolete, but not as long as it works for you. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.If your system does not recognize your used parallel port drive (Add New Hardware Wizard), select the hardware from the list: SCSI controllers, Iomega, Iomega Parallel Port Interface, then Finish.",5,Flexible Data Storage and Transfer,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",0.0608

Although the performance of the drive has been great I find that the media to be too expensive and much larger than the comparable LS120 drives. Another suggestion is your buying this drive to use it for fast access to your files, don't go with the parallel. Instead go with the internal IDE or the SCSI. Both of these are at least twice as fast as a parallel drive.",4,An OK drive,959385600,"05 27, 2000",0.25
2,A3A15L96IYUO6V,B00000J3II,Michael Smith,"[0, 0]","I have a 486 that I use this drive on. I am so surprised at the speed that it reads the info through the parallel port. I had heard that the parallel port could be slow with a ZIP drive, but it seems to work about the same speed as an ATAPI drive I had preinstalled on my PII 400Mhz. The price is right for ZIP drives. Don't bother with the 250 MB drive - disks are more and not enough people have the drives yet that support them.",5,Works great on a 486,958694400,"05 19, 2000",0.1873
3,A1WVMDRJU19AFD,B00000J3II,ODB,"[26, 28]","I have enjoyed the convenience of my zip drive- My university's graphics computers have zip drives, the local Kinkos have zip drives in their computers, my parents even have a zip drive now. Its a nice, accepted standard, and for the price the disks read fast and work well- unlike 3.5 floppies, no zip disk has ever corrupted data for me. Zip disks are made of sturdy plastic which you can safely keep in your (shirt) pocket without damage.The strongest competetitor to the zip disk standard is the 120 MB super-drive, which is a drive that is backwards-compatible with 1.6 MB (traditional)3.5 floppies, so you can totally replace your old floppy drive and still have it when you need it. A couple years ago it was expected that this drive would blow Iomega zip out of the picture, but super-floppies haven't really caught on.In terms of exchanging data between computers in the same house, it is suprisingly simple to run an ethernet network instead- and there are other advantage besides transfering files- such as printer sharing and web sharing.-Note. I think the zip 100 is more functional for the price than the 250 zip. -(For backing up really large files, the best thing these days is a cd writer or re-writer.)",5,the most popular removable storage next to floppies,944697600,"12 9, 1999",0.4468

5,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00000J3II,Shelley Gammon Geek,"[3, 4]","I'm a Mac user, but I also have a Windows PC in my office. My workplace has over 1,000 employees and the majority of them are on Windows, while I am one of 3 people in the organization that consistently uses a Mac.I am sent files all the time via the Network GroupWare e-mail system. I never wanted to hook my Mac up through all the logging in and everything involved in a Novell system, so I never got the Mac version of the software to connect my Mac fully to the network.So, when someone sends me a file via GroupWise, I copy the attachment onto my ZIP disk and then eject that disk and put it in my Mac to work on the file. Not the most efficient way to go about things, but this 100MB Iomega ZIP drive hasn't failed me once in the past 4 years.Since the Mac OS can read both Mac and PC ZIP disks, I use PC formatted disks and move them back and forth from Windows (the Parallel drive) to Mac (the factory installed 250MB drive) all day long.ZIP disks can hold an equivalent of about 74 floppy disks and the speed is lightning fast when compared to floppies. My only gripe is that Iomega does not make these drives with an on/off switch... even if your computer is off for a week, you've got to unplug your ZIP drive if you don't want it to eat up electricity. Honestly, I doubt that a little ZIP drive that isn't spinning a disk uses more than a single kilowatt hour per month, but it's a waste nonetheless. This one gripe wasn't enough of a drawback to take a star away from the 5 star rating I'm giving this gizmo. It's dependable, it's fast and ZIP is an industry standard.

6,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00000J3II,tropic_of_criticism,"[10, 11]","This device has essentially been eclipsed by its own success. Now the solution-of-choice only for older machines (more than 2 years), or for mobile professionals who want to make absolutely sure that they'll be able to connect a ZIP drive to any PC they encounter, this most basic ZIP drive should be avoided by most purchasers.Fact is, if you need to be mobile with your ZIP, you should go the USB route these days. Every new PC and Macintosh comes with USB connectivity, and the difference in access speed is great enough to justify the minimal extra cost. This parallel port machine is the very slowest ZIP drive available. If you download files of any size (1M or more) you will notice the difference.You'll also notice the difference between this model and an internal model. Make sure that you really need to be mobile with the drive itself before you choose an external model. As has been stated in other reviews, the ZIP-100 has become something of a standard nowadays, and many machines come with a ZIP drive pre-installed.Also, even though the price is attractive, think carefully about choosing this model if you plan to do much printing. Most printers use the parallel port, and although you can hook up both a printer and this drive to the same port, you can't use both simultaneously. This is disasterous if you attempt to print a file from the ZIP drive. It can be done, but it takes a lot longer than printing from other drives. Also, forget about accessing the ZIP drive if you've sent a print command. Your parallel ZIP drive will be unavilable for the duration of the print.Having said all this, I absolutely agree with other reviewers who praise the ZIP-100 format. It's got the broadest-based installation of any ZIP format, so chances are you'll be able to port your data more successfully with a ZIP-100 than any other format. True, 100mb is starting to look like small, but it's still an awful lot of room for almost everything but full-motion, full-sound video.Still, I have to give this product fewer stars than it would've deserved two years ago, simply because Iomega has come out with better stuff in the interim. For many users, it would be wiser to buy an internal ZIP-100. Or, better still, buy an external USB ZIP-100 for current compatability, and leave the internal bay available for future installation of a JAZ-2MB. That way, you'll create a removable media solution that handles both past and future needs.",2,Not the wisest choice for most users,959731200,"05 31, 2000",0.2931
7,A23ZO1BVFFLGHO,B00000J3II,Wayne Chung c4victor,"[8, 8]","The Zip100 is a minimum necessity for today's larger and larger file formats - MPEG, MP3, and multiple images files can easily run up to 100MB. I've used the Zip since its inception when it knocked old Syquest 88MB drives out of business about 5 years ago. The size and convenience is why there is really only one choice for removable media with easy and immediate read-write capability.There are definite pluses and minuses. Some will say get a CD-R(W) drive - but burning a CD is definitely not as immediate as a Zip. The parallel port is a major bummer because of the thru-speed. But those of you who are not major speed demons won't be disappointed compared to a floppy. The Zip drive allows daisy chaining so you can connect/output to other peripherals.Iomega cut cost on the power on/off (it's always on when plugged in). But really the overall design is very good - you can place it flat or vertical. Even though the thick parallel cord may tend to twist the main unit.There are a plethora of other Iomega choices. And I would really ask yourself if you are planning on USB or SCSI - each are noticeably faster. On the plus side, the 100MB format is so common in print shops, university labs, and copy places that you can't go wrong. Plus the price of each disk is recognizably less than the 250MB. Seriously think about your file formats. If you plan to do a lot video - you'll need to go with a Jaz. And you can get these refurbished for about the same cost and hold 1Gig. The only barrier to entry is the SCSI necessity and the extra cost of disks. Overall, the Zip100 has been a major workhorse for me - back and forth between work and home/Mac and PC MS98/NT. It has performed flawlessly.",5,If it's simple and works - then it's not stupid,960422400,"06 8, 2000",0.1234
