Well, I play the good music. These just happen to perform the actions needed to make that sound audible. But that's beside the point. Look, they're not like super bass-heavy subs. They're just well balanced affordable speakers that sound great in a bar. They get plenty loud and they look plenty good. I have mine mounted up on the ceiling and hardly anyone notices them. UNTIL THEY GET THEIR DAMN FACES ROCKED OFF. Should have paid attention, suckas.",5,Are these even still for sale?,1362614400,"03 7, 2013",0.1101

A salesman at a big box chain electronics store tried to talk me out of them, but for $30.00, you just can't beat these speakers. They are easy to set up. Anyone looking for an inexpensive speaker for a garage, patio or for a secondary stereo system would be very happy with them.",4,Great sound for the money,1220227200,"09 1, 2008",0.4402
2,A11ED8O95W2103,B00000J3G3,lighten_up_already2 lighten_up_already2,"[2, 4]","I used a pair of these speakers to set up what I called a bubba vision cheap home theater in my family room with an old Sansui receiver, an inexpensive DVD player, and a JVC 27 TV.These worked very well, and were a considerable improvement over the speakers in the TV. However, it wasn't soon before I felt rather dissatisfied with them. Not unhappy, but just aware that I was listening to a very well built but ultimately cheap set of speakers, so I resold them.However, I also own a pair of the AudioSource LS200 speakers. They cost even less than these speakers, and to me have a bigger and warmer sound. I'm still using those and plan to be for quite some time.",3,"Not bad for the price, but not satisfying in the long haul.",1163203200,"11 11, 2006",0.2529

I put them on our patio and the entire area is filled with great sound (the patio is about 15'x30'). If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers for outside, this is your pair.",5,What a Great Deal!,1066867200,"10 23, 2003",0.3835
4,A3OHJS5Q9C4IYS,B00000J3G3,Scott D. Estes,"[3, 4]",I bought these speakers to use on our deck and also to point out at our pool. I am amazed at the sound quality for such a small box. If you are looking for an inexpensive set of speakers to place outdoors then these are a perfect fit. I am going to order a second pair in order to increase my coverage area.,4,Great for the price.....,1088208000,"06 26, 2004",0.3868
5,A1NOM79RDZRLHM,B00000J3G3,sean wkw,"[0, 0]","I bought these several years ago for listening outside on my 3 acres of property....4 speakers for my backyard but I can hear these from the front yard and when I'm in the woods too. I bought these as a cheap unknown brand speaker that I could use and abuse while leaving them out in all weather conditions...rain, snow, ice and a few hurricanes through the years and getting knocked around by kids. The sound quality and sound output surpassed my expectations. The overall construction surprised me too as they lasted several more seasons than I thought they would (6 years now and all year long outdoor usage). Due to the fact that I crank up the volume very high for when I'm mowing, or deep in the woods or having a crazy pool party, with or without other people :) .... I'm now looking into buying a replacement for one speaker that seems to be on it's way out. It still puts out sound but poor quality compared to the other 3. Just a good all around speaker that does not break the bank.",4,Surpassed my expectations with sound Quality and durability,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",-0.1116
6,A39KOJG83K8F1U,B00000J3G3,temply123,"[0, 1]",These speakers sounded great but I do like to crank up the occasional KISS or VanHalen and these speakers just stopped working. I've never blown a speaker before but I guess that's what happened.,2,Don't bother,1247961600,"07 19, 2009",0.416
7,A38QEATH3NODFM,B00000J3G3,Wiseguy 945,"[1, 1]","My brother and I bought a set of KLH 970 speakers 8 or so years ago for my father to replace some old larger speakers in his house, and they are the best value speakers I have ever seen. We liked them so much we got a second set to replace the other set of speakers on his stereo. These little guys really deliver a great range of sound in a small package. It's not suprising to me that KLH is still making this exact model this many years later. You can't find another 3 way sound speaker at this price. Also, they are durable and are weather resistant. I don't recommend leaving them on a patio in a monsoon or a blizzard, and the black doesn't make good friends in bright sun, but you can mount these to the porch or patio roof/overhang and leave these out in damp weather with no loss of wear or sound, at least not as of yet. The more I looked around at different facilities with PA or sound systems outdoors, the more I have noticed these speakers being utilized. So if you have just a few bucks and want to some aged speakers, this is the perfect little set to get. Everybody thinks bigger and pricer is better, but I have to argue that these speakers have done their job superbly, and thats why my dad still uses them 8 years later. This 970 set of KLH speakers are actually Identical speakers to the 980 models, but run a 5-40 watt range whereast the 980 series runs 10-100 watt range. So don't break the bank if you want a set of small speakers, I think you will be suprised. Note, as with many small speakers, if you are a bass sound fan, then you might want to buy a sub-woofer, but these do a fine job at normal range.",5,"Huge Value and Unbelievable performance, and durable too",1153699200,"07 24, 2006",0.2093
