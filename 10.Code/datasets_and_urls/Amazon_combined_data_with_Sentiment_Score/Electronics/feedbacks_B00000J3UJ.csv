1,A24UIMLT48Z09O,B00000J3UJ,C. Collier Clint Collier,"[0, 0]",When will Amazon wise up and allow NO stars for a rating?This is so cheaply made it is worthless. The battery compartment is &#34;held in place&#34; by a tiny plastic bar. Broke almost immediately on my unit making the thing totally useless; with out the battery compartment locked in place it simply doesn't work. They might as well have made the cable out of a piece of string!Don't waste your money,1,don't bother! hunk of junk,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",-0.042

I don't think it magically reset its own combination. Mechanical locks don't do that. More likely the rotating mechanism that allows the lock to unlock got jammed. My IT guy had to saw it off. Did some damage to the cosmetics of my company laptop.Simply put: Don't use this product.Great while it worked. Imagine getting it jammed at a coffee house rather then your office or home.

You have to read the instructions to set the combination correctly!They all have worked well and they NEVER have changed the combination on me spontaneously!The newer model has the same features but uses AAA bats and not a 9V which the old one used. It is thiner than the old model also. I like the blinking red light when ever I arm it. I run the cable through my zipper on my backpack and leave in strapped to the desk or chair in my hotel room. It creates a shrill LOUD alarm (if you set it for this feature) when the unit is moved. There are two sensitivities. You can set it to only alarm if the cable is cut. Yes you can cut the cable with a good set of wire cutters...so it would not stop anyone determined to take your notebook from you and had strong intentions to do so. It will stop someone from just grabbing it and trying to run.I also really like the little gadget in the photo...(lower right hand corner of photo) it fits into the security hole of my notebook very snugly. The cable of the Defcon can go through the hole of this gadget and you can just lay it next to your notebook and it will start to scream as soon as the notebook is moved (it does give you a ~15 second warning before screaming with a loud CHIRP sound, so you can disarm it. Go to Targus website and check it out. I don't work for them. I do believe they sell a quality little alarm. It is not Fort Knox, it is a lot better than nothing. Blinking light and siren deters the common dumb criminal (not on drugs or really crazy)from taking your computer. It's should be just one of a series of methods you have to secure your notebook, not the only one.It's nice for travel. You can even hang the thing on a door knob and know if someone opens the door. It's a motion alarm with a blinking red light. The number of blinks tells you how it is armed. I recommend it.",5,There is a newer model than the one in the photo: It's Great!,1214784000,"06 30, 2008",0.0378
4,A2V1J3JT5OOZFO,B00000J3UJ,Dragonwort Castle,"[1, 2]","This is not a review of the product but I thought this information may be good to know before you order. Could save someone money and frustration.I ordered this Defcon 1 unit (~$34) in April 2013, and received a Devcon CL (combination lock and cable ~$21) that was improperly labled with an Amazon SKU label listed improperly as a Defcon 1 unit. It arrived in a clear plastic pack so I could see it was the wrong item. If I did not have Prime it would likely have cost me shipping. Prime enabled me to return it and get a full refund, so I was OK with this. Just FYI, if you are ordering this and paying for shipping.It looked like a good device and was recommended to lock down a ~$300 RV voltage protector that can be stolen easily while camping. But, rather than risk another mislabeled device from the same Amazon seller, I opted to use something else. Amazon may not charge shipping if one re orders when this happens, but you would probably lose it if you requested a refund.Be aware this is the FIRST time an Amazon seller has done this to my knowledge in over 15 years of business with Amazon (I am very happy with Amazon and appreciate their costomer service), so I just wanted to help if you pay for shipping.

8,AQT8N7YPGVWCM,B00000J3UJ,Jamal,"[0, 0]","Wow. I am enraged right now at this godforsaken POS laptop lock. Let me set the scene:I go into the library for a nice, long afternoon of studying. I don't feel comfortable leaving my laptop on the table whenever I go to the bathroom, so I bring this Targus Defcon CL along to secure my computer for whenever I'm not at the table. I connect it and get on with my studying. Come dinnertime, I feel it's time to go, so I put the combo in the lock and IT WON'T UNLOCK. WTF.I am getting frantic, thinking maybe I've gone insane and forgot the combo (which would be impossible since it's the digits of my freaking date of birth). Desperate, I Google Targus Defcon CL won't open. Lo and behold, this exact same thing has happened to hundreds of other people!! The Amazon reviews alone are almost all about how the combo will randomly change on you! Now I'm trippin out, so I start Googling a way to open the piece of crap up without the combo. Luckily, engagdet.com did an article a few years ago about how easy it is to cut the cable or to decipher the combination of these things.I drive home to grab a strong set of wire cutters, and come back to cut the cable. Takes me about 10 minutes to cut through, with a 7 wire cutter (something a person can have in their pocket while you're away from your comp, spend 10 min, and be off with your laptop in their hands). Unfortunately, during that 10 min duration, someone reports me to the librarian because they think I'm trying to steal a laptop. I have to log in to the computer to prove that it's mine. Slightly embarrassing, but even he thought it was hilarious that the lock not only messed up my combo, but was pretty easy to cut through.SO, to recap, the reasons this is the WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED:1) IT WILL RANDOMLY CHANGE THE COMBO. THIS HAS HAPPENED IN MORE CASES THAN NOT (Google it).2) The cable literally takes 5-10 minutes with a mediocre set of cutters to get through. Anyone can take your laptop if you are off in the bathroom or something for a bit.",1,The worst product I have ever purchased in my life. Straight up.,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",-0.0474

Dumas Shopping in NY,"[0, 1]","If you follow the instructions (that is why they are there) this lock will work just fine, I have never had it mysteriously change combination on me. There are only two problems with this little lock, the first is, it tends to seize up on occasion, but it comes out after a few seconds (not 5 minutes as mentioned by another reviewer). Also, this lock is fairly easy to change the combo, so if you have a roommate that hates you, or criminals that carry around screwdrivers, you may be in a bit of trouble.This is a MECHANICAL lock, it does not have a mind o it's own.",4,Follow the instructions,1250467200,"08 17, 2009",-0.1898

I used this poorly designed lock on my macbook pro and the thief was still able to destroy the lock with a cutter. Mind you, the lock portion was destroyed, not the cable. The thief was able to yank out enough of a crease located between my laptop hole and the combo lock itself for his metal cutter to easily break its clippers. Basically this device provides a false sense of security when contends to a thief with formidably-equipped metal cutter.",1,Design Flawed! Laptop Got Stolen Anyway,1314316800,"08 26, 2011",-0.2998
