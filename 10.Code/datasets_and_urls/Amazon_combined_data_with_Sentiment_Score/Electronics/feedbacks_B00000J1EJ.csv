0,A3NNOT58HV18UW,B00000J1EJ,"[0, 0]",Bought these for a long airplane ride. They worked pretty well for a few days but then the right side went out. That seems to be pretty common with this set. Also the battery compartment is in the cord and in a really awkward position where it hangs free and pulls on the headphones on one side.,1,Works great if you're deaf in one ear.,1263859200,"01 19, 2010",,0.3068

I don't think the stewardesses were happy that we didn't have to buy headphones though... but, they worked well and we were able to hear the in-flight movie and the movies on our portable DVD players. 4 stars because they are a little flimsy and some of them broke with more rugged use when we got home. However, two pair are still functioning quite well. Saw these at this reduced price and I just bought 5 more pair for some travelling this Summer. I don't get into all the techie stuff that others do... I just say if it works well, great...",4,Worked for me...,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",,0.2295

They have few jacks to fit to different systems, so it can be universal to many audio electronics. Also it stratches somewhat, so it can fit to different sizes of head.",5,Really nice!!!,1268092800,"03 9, 2010",,0.4736

It holds batteries in it so the batteries of your player can last longer in energy.Nice idea but awkward in use. It is heavy in weight and in a bad spot. This little box should have been higher up towards the head instead of the middle of the cord.

One side speaker went and then a few months later, the other one stopped as well. They lasted less than one year. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.We opted INSTEAD for PHILLIPS O'NEILL SHO9561/28.

I remembered that these had that feature - it was not one I could figure out on my own though, I did need to reference the directions as to where to plug everything in at, but maybe that's just me.

6,A2XJD20SEKWFCK,B00000J1EJ,"[0, 0]","While these are ok sounding, they have a feature that makes them one I use often. I bought these cheap. They offer pretty decent noise cancelling, for cutting the lawn. Also, they come in handy for when I'm at workCounting beats and mixing, these headphones with the noise reduction, make it so much better to dial in.As everyday headphones the sound and it's delicate wired nature, may turn some people off.They are somewhat comfortable, battery life is great, and comes with a carrying bad. No quarter inch adapter,not too many people need it anymore.All in all, a bit delicate, wires can become weak at junctions.They do what I want them to do, so I buy a couple and keep a pair as backup for gig.I own Grado, too bright, Beyerdynamic, my favorite set, and briefly had Bose, way too pricey, and nowhere near neutral in sound.If they were more durable, I would rate them higher.If you're careful with them and want cheap noise cancelling headphones, they are worth it.",3,Nice for lawn cutting.,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",,0.3645
7,A47K229NJH9J6,B00000J1EJ,"[1, 1]","There is a slight reduction in regular, low-frequency noise as in air travel, but these are not nearly as effective as Bose or Audio-Technica.",2,Barely works,1225238400,"10 29, 2008",,-0.5157

I am sadly disappointed and will not buy any headphone that says Maxell again - you can't trust anybody these days, they've all gone for cheap and to heck with quality.",1,Lasted a matter of weeks,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",,-0.1728
9,A1WPXG000113YQ,B00000J1EJ,"[2, 2]","I previously had a pair of Sony noise-cancellers. The big downfall of the Maxells are the battery pack. It's about half-way down the cord. If you use them at a desk and move much, you'll constantly pull the pack off of the desk and it'll fall with a sharp jerk to your headphones. The Sonys only used a single AAA battery but the Maxells use two. So, Sony was able to put it in a compartment on the headphone band with no aggravation. Oddly, the Sonys seem to have much better battery life for me. The Maxells do enclose the ears much better to help block sounds, but they do start to hurt your ears after prolonged use. If you wear them for hours at a time, the similarly priced Sonys are easier on the ear. I'm not wild about the way the Maxells fold up, either. The Sonys kind of spin in and make for much flatter storage. Another problem with the Maxells is a loud creaking sound from the plastic. Often just moving your jaw seems to produce a loud plastic-on-plastic noise that comes through quite loud. With a slight re-design, Maxell could have a nice set of headphones. Wait until then or try another brand.",2,Horrible battery pack,1213747200,"06 18, 2008",,-0.0154

Within a month, it got loose and had to keep jiggling it to get it charging. Took it back to the store I got it, and they gave me a brand new one one the spot. But, several months later, the new one had the same problem. Brought it back again. This time I had to wait 2 weeks to get it repaired. Two months later, same problem. Another 2 week repair. I'm striving to not move it at all while it is plugged in, but heck, it's a laptop! Anyway, if it happens a fourth time, my warranty says they have to give me a new one.",4,"I love it, but that power jack has got to go",1136419200,"01 5, 2006",,-0.1131

12,A294CSQXGL76CV,B00000J1EJ,"[128, 133]",These headphones were disappointing. I bought them to use in a computer room that has a refrigerator size disk drive and an even bigger AC unit. These headphones do a good job of reducing the low-frequency noise but most of the high frequency stuff comes right through. As a result the noise reduction for me was about 20 - 30% of the total. I also tried them with a leaf blower and had the same results. They do seem to work well at taking out low rumbling humming noises like you would find in air travel but not for anything that has high pitched fan noise like AC units or vacuums.,2,Depends on the type of noise,1005177600,"11 8, 2001",David M,0.0886
13,A16RGMORD80K9V,B00000J1EJ,"[5, 5]","Ive had the Maxell NC II over a couple of years & they are still holding up well.I now use these headphones primarily at home to relax in the recliner while listening to music or taking an undisturbed nap.I originally got them because I was a long haul truck driver & the engine & wind noise was just wearing me out not to mention having to turn the radio up too loud just to hear it.These headphones helped to stop that.The noise canceling feature is effective in reducing the ambient noise around me creating a much more relaxed, stress free environment.At the end of the day I wasnt nearly as tired as when I didnt use the headphones.Im not an audiophile so I cant give you stats & freq #s but I enjoy my music, books on tape & movies more using these headphones.I also like the collapsible, over the ear design. They are comfortable & I havent had any problems with them getting hot after wearing them over an extended time.The battery life is very good, the electrical cord is a good length & the on/off switch is sturdy with a small green light when on.Im going to upgrade to the NC IV for home & keep my NC II for in the car.",4,These have worked great for several years...,1230768000,"01 1, 2009",DooDude,0.9107
14,A1X0990QXMJIY7,B00000J1EJ,"[5, 5]","I got these headphones in June. By August the sound in one ear was cutting out. I could move the wire and get it back temporarily. Fine, if you don't move your head. Now it's October and the sound in that ear is gone for good. That good price for noise cancelling headphones, isn't so great for only 5 months.

15,A20TZ1MQ0KMJRR,B00000J1EJ,"[3, 3]","I purchased these headphones before traveling to Europe for a couple weeks and the headphones worked great. The sound quality of the phones was good quality and the comfort was very nice. The battery powered noise cancellation was also a bonus and it worked very well on the airplane as well as on trains. I used it on both flights with great relaxation and I also used it on the Chunnel and some subways with continued satisfaction.The weight, length of cord, and fold up feature all made these headphones ideal for traveling.Unfortunately they just are not sturdy or durable. They are made of plastic and feel very fragile. I was always very worried of breaking them in my bag or when putting them in the storage pouch. But worse than their structural durability is that the wiring used is exposed to stress when folded up.In other words the cord is pinched when the phones are folded up and this is a terrible design. After only about a month, one of the wires split and I lost the right headphone completely. And forget about trying to fix it as it is virtually impossible to remove and repair the wire without destroying the casing.I am very disappointed in the lifespan of these headphones and will not be buying from this company again. If not for the poor design these would have been great headphones for the price.",2,Good product if it could last...,1236556800,"03 9, 2009",Jaha,0.1962
16,A311UKPJDYZOVL,B00000J1EJ,"[8, 9]","I've never felt a need for noise cancellation headphones, but I received these as a gift. Fortunately, no one spent a lot of money on them, because they really seem cheap to me. The construction is flimsy, and they're bulky. Maxell might as well have included a paper sack to carry them in, as the bag that comes with them is not much more than that. It offers no protection to the headphones at all.I just can't see packing this kind of bulk in my scarce carry-on space. I don't see any payoff for the bulk in terms of the sound that you get: these simply sound quite mediocre with the noise cancellation off. With noise cancellation on, the sound is even worse. It's flat and lifeless.I had recently purchased a pair of Sennheiser PX-100s. They sound vastly better for the money. They fold down super-compactly into a nicely-designed case and even cost a few bucks less.I don't know about the expensive noise-cancellation headphones, but I would rather have a better pair of regular headphones for this price.",2,"Cheap Headphones, there are much better options for the money",1199145600,"01 1, 2008",JH,0.083
17,ATY86XH2DJ4ZH,B00000J1EJ,"[5, 5]","I am not an audiophile, but I do care about the sound I hear. I bought this headset last week mainly for the time I spend removing snow in winter. I wanted a headset that covers my ears well, while sounding OK. I thought this noise cancelling phone would be a great choice, especially because my snowblower is terribly loud. Well, it does cover my ears comfortably well, but unfortunately thats all that is good about this headset. It isnt particularly great sounding, and the biggest disappointment was noise cancellation - rather the lack of it. It is hard to perceive much difference between NC being on or off!! It does suppress some, so I know it is on, but it can hardly suppress anything real. I quickly gave up any hope about its use with snowblower, but I then found it cant do much about the sound of my home's furnace as well - which is barely audible even without a headset.. bummer.I have a Sony MDR-NC6 that I have been using for the past 2 years or so. It still works great, just that it doesnt have a cupped headset to cover my ear. If that is not one of your criteria, I highly recommend it. It sounds way better, is cheaper (at least now it is), noise cancellation works great too.
