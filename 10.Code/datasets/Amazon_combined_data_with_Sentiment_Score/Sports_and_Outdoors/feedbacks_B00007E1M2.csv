It is a whole different type of tool. The Becker is massive, burly, tough, heavy duty and heavy. The SOG is light, nimble, and low profile with a much smaller and thinner blade. I just didn't care for the feel of it in my hand and I don't think it would make a good survivalist knife compared to the becker. It's too fragile for chopping and hacking and prying.

I like the blade design, it was sharp out of the package, but with a few passes with the lansky turn box and now its really sharp. The nylon sheath its ok dont have a problem with it. The balance is good but the handle its small, if it was a little bigger and more rubber like for better grip it would be better. I would have given it more stars if it wasn't for the handle, it is still a very good knife from a known brand.

Held its edge, the grip was good if you were not wearing gloves and is made cutting chores easy. The 4 star rating is because the sheath was a bit cheap. Chunks got torn out of it. The blade finish also wears off. I ended up engraving mine a bit so it didn't look like everyone else's knife. Everyone seemed to be carrying these since they were cheap and sold locally. I would suggest these were serial numbered so you could at least ID yours from another one. Great buy and if you don't have a need for an M9 bayonet, this could be your fixed blade for travel and deployments.",4,Great knife for your pistol holster.,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",0.1373
18,A3OF1S2WBC1WJQ,B00007E1M2,Satch,"[1, 2]","I ordered a Seal Pup Elite, and was sent the regular Seal Pup instead. The company just refunded the difference, so I called it a wash.The Seal Pup is a good knife. Though I have not thoroughly abused mine, I can say that it feels solid. It is also, quite literally, sharp enough to shave with right out of the box. I actually tried it, and it works.The sheath is sturdy, and works reasonably well with a MOLLE vest or pack, but the loops are a bit too tight, making it difficult to weave. They are also oddly spaced, so the sheath doesn't mount tightly, but slides a bit. The pouch on the front of the sheath is large enough to comfortably accommodate a Victorinox Rucksack lockblade knife. It's a good sized pouch.===Update:I have been using this as my primary outdoors knife for some time now, and I really have no complaints. I've used it for everything from cutting cord to batoning firewood. I even used it to hack through light brush on one occasion. The blade retains an edge well, and I have no questions about the structural integrity of the knife overall. It's light, and just the right size for an all-around utility knife. The partly serrated blade makes the piece especially versatile. The sheath is holding up very well, and I typically keep fire-making materials in the pouch. I can't say that I've extensively tested every offering at the $50-$60 price point, but I can say that I'm pleased with the purchase and am more than comfortable heading off the trail with the SEAL Pup.===",5,Seal Pup,1320019200,"10 31, 2011",0.2089
19,A8D13MQNLSQ6V,B00007E1M2,Shanks,"[0, 0]","I picked up one of these knives as a work knife for my hunting lease. I used it all this past season and was impressed. Very sharp, and so light it almost feels like a toy. It cut burlap, canvas, camo netting, 550 cord and other assorted rope effortlessly. It wouldn't be appropriate for chopping (too light), but it's definitely a cutter. It would be great as a tackle box knife and I'm sure it would be satisfactory for self defense if necessary. A few minor criticisms: the serrated edge portion of the blade is so small its essentially worthless. I'm not a fan of serrated edges on knives to begin with; if I had it to do over again I'd buy the plain blade. My other criticism is that the sheath feels flimsy, I would much prefer kydex or even leather. This would be an ideal fixed blade knife for kids or adults with smaller hands. I'm becoming more of a SOG fan than I ever expected to be. I prefer a heavier knife and bought a SOG Super Bowie 2.0 (fabulous blade!). All in all, a great knife for the price.

I gently ran it on my arm and all the hair fell right off! The handle is a little small and for those with large hands, it may be too small but I didn't have any problems with it.

My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full-tang knife, and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt. The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it (the nylon model with the integrated multi-tool pouch) isn't really that great in my opinion. It's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi-tool there, but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it, so to each their own.That said, I have no qualms about my purchase and it's a solid, well-built knife that I anticipate will last me quite some time.",4,"Well made, sheath leaves something to be desired.",1370995200,"06 12, 2013",0.2418

I think the sheath is way better than any of the aforementioned knives as well.The Bear Grylls has some cool features (like the fire steel, whistle, and sharpener), but you can probably fit at least 2 of those items in the SOG's front pouch, and wear a better whistle on a cord around your neck, and it doesn't seem as well made as the SOG Seal Pup.The very light weight of this knife is also a big plus for those long hikes!I haven't abused this particular knife yet, but it seems as if it would hold up admirably due to its simple construction, and I like AUS-8 steel a lot.My backup knife for my Bug Out Bag is another high value knife, the Morakniv Companion MG. You can get them in 1095 Carbon steel or 12c27 Sandvik Stainless steel, and either one is great. Very inexpensive and also very high quality, I can't recommend them enough.Anyway, I LOVE this knife, and I'm sure you will too at this price point!You'll notice some bad reviews on the sheath - however take note of how old the reviews are, they are from the first version of this knife which had an overly long choil and less of a cutting edge due to more serrations, and apparently a weird sheath.

27,A3T7F2FQ9B4HIN,B00007E1M2,Zack,"[2, 3]","From my experience with this knife I wouldn't want it for civilian survival/outdoor use. I received the newer version with the thankfully shorter finger choil and steel upgrade (AUS-8 instead of AUS-6). While I don't mind AUS-8 at this price point I will say I don't like it in this knife. The first time I used it the blade chipped in multiple places just from hacking off light kindling. Therefore, I would never hard use this knife. The clip point blade is ideal for thrusting soft materials but the very tip of mine has already broken off somehow which I am going to blame on the steel and thin tip thickness because I really haven't abused this knife. Maybe it was a bad batch of steel or maybe it was poor treatment of it by SOG. The serrations are decent for cutting rope and chord and there is enough belly that there is still a lot of plain edge to work with. The finish also comes of pretty easily which is bad because this steel rusts if not cared for (ie. used in a survival scenario). The handle is well textured on the sides and shaped for medium to large sized hands. The recess for your thumb on the spine is awkward because of the flared guard and really needs to be jimped to work well in my opinion. The steel also looses its edge pretty quickly so I wouldn't use it for hunting and skinning but it is easy to sharpen. I got the nylon sheath and it is not of the highest quality on terms of stitching and I would recommend getting the Kydex version.",3,Not the Best,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",0.028
