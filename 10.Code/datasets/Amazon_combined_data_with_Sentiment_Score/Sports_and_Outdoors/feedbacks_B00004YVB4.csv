However, it is missing tools that you will probably want, such as scissors, while including things you rarely use. (Also, a blade that locks open is preferable for safety.) Pick another model and you (or your gift recipient) will be happier.",3,"Good quality, outdated tool selection",1105056000,"01 7, 2005",0.4047
1,A36K8DLXYRUMBR,B00004YVB4,Amber M. Anderson,"[0, 0]","I don't see this as a serious every day tool - there are far better (and more expensive) knives out there. If you really need a knife, adding one with too many multitools makes it too awkward. Alternatively, if you really do need a lot of tools, this knife isn't it. No corkscrew (I actually use that one) or scissors (ditto) or saw (same there when I can find a sharp one).But it's a great starter knife for a kid or as one to throw into a kit or glove compartment just to have something.As a pocket knife - it's serviceable. Victorinox is the official Swiss Army knife of course. This one isn't super high quality, but it's pretty decent. Since the description doesn't tell you the tools, here they are with comments. Let me first just say that saying it has 12 tools is misleading - many are combo tools that kind of don't merit being called separate items. I had to look up the description on their website to find them all (again the packaging has a nice picture to help you also):1) Standard Phillips head. Stands up so that it is roughly emerging from the middle of the handle making a T shape. Good for leverage, bad for any kind of tight space that cannot accomodate the turning radius of the handle or that needs length on the blade to reach down in as the metal portion of the screw driver is only 1.5 (look at me getting out my tape measure!)2) Long blade - this would be your main knife blade. Clicks securely into place - so long as you don't do anything that goes against the safety rules in the boyscout (and used to be in the girl scout thank you very much) manual, you should be fine! Takes a fairly intentional (but not unreasonable) amount of force to close. Doable by a child by the way, but definitely not loose enough to present obvious hazards. Comes reasonably sharp, sharpens up real nice by stone. Haven't used enough to say if it holds the edge well, but theoretically being Swiss steel it should? Did not see a rating on it and was hasty enough to have already tossed the packaging well over a week ago. Reasonable balance if holding by the handle - enough for good control. Reasonable utility. Length is 2 and 5/8 if measuring all the way down to where it emerges from the handle (as the TSA pictures do) meaning it is, unfortunately too long to take on a plane under the new rules about to go into effect. (only 2 1/4 is sharp though). Just under 1/2 at its widest point.3/4) Can opener with small flathead screw driver - This is one of those hard to use, easy to cut yourself with can openers that you will none the less love if you are in a pinch and the only food you have is in a can with no pull top (getting rarer all the time). It's basically a hook that goes under the can lid and a sharpened part that stabs into and mangles the metal. Some people are really good at using these...I can usually get the food out of the can in 5 minutes with minimal blood loss. The small screw driver is a flat bit at the top of this tool. Again, very problematic if you are in any kind of tight space. The width of the can opener blade will prevent it from going far in and the length of the tool at 1.5 doesn't give you much to work with past the handle anyway. This does come out directly from the end of the handle though...not in a T like the phillips. Honestly, I'd find something else to use in most cases if at all possible. If you slip, there's a sharp can opener to cut yourself with. Joy!5/6/7) Cap lifter or Bottle opener (same thing)/Wire stripper/large flathead. Well, same comments on the screw driver as with the small flathead except that its bigger and no sharp hazards when it slips. As for the cap lifter or bottle opener - yep, it opened my can. But it slipped on the first try - not as good as the one built into the handle of my Oxo can opener, that's for sure. Could use more of a hook. But it's okay. Wire stripper though...that's just a joke. I'm an electrical engineer and I can't for the life of me think what wire I'd strip with this. It's just a non-sharpened notch. You'd need a wire of exactly the right size with sleeving precut, loose, and not so long you can push it without the wire slipping out of the notch. As I said...I can't think what wire that would be that I'd ever run into. Seriously, this seems next to useless. If you NEED a wire stripper, this isn't it. You might have better luck stripping your wire with creative use of the can opener8) Small knife blade. Good for finer things (scratching corrosion off of small parts for instance?) but probably less useful (to me anyway) than the large blade. 1 5/8 from the handle to tip, 1 1/2 of which is sharpened. Comes out of the opposite end of the large blade just in case you're one of the people who has some odd use case (that I have not yet fathomed) why this matters.9) Reamer - skinny little tool with a sharp blade reminiscent of one half of a scissor blade. If you don't know what a reemer is, go on...google it (using the search term reamer blade on pocket knife. You'll learn something! Basically it's for making holes in material or cleaning up rough edges. The little hole in it is (apparently, according to the internet) for assisting with sewing applications...maybe. This also comes out from the middle to make a T shape with the handle. That's probably for the best if you're punching holes in leather honestly...more control I'd think?10) Toothpick - it's one of those little white plastic jobbies. I've only known one person ever who used this...and it gets gross and chewed looking easy. This particular one seems a little bendy and easy to break (didn't take it to that point, but it seems it would be easy)...so not so good even for something where you just need something stiff and pokey (shut up...)11) Tweezer - also a small little thing that comes out of the handle - metal, easy to bend, but actually kinda better than I thought it would be. Can get an okay grip with it. Would be useful for slivers or where you need to pick up something with slighly more precision than fingers can manage.12) Key ring - *sigh* this is a feature, not a tool...but yes, this is listed as the 12th tool. Seems okay...secure which is good if you're going to hang this knife off a string (I do). Kinda small but I don't see where that's a downside...keeps you from putting other stuff on the same keyring.Also a few more things to mention:Comes oiled. As in, it got oil all over my fingers while I was opening the tools. Good...mostly.Handle - seems reasonable quality, but the way the metal insert (with all the tools) is set into it, it's not the most comfortable. Has some edges to it (the straight edges of the metal insert and of the tools) that are that you will feel if you work with it. Less comfortable than a good pocket knife that is just a pocket knife.On the whole - not a bad pocket knife at all. Seems good quality. A bit lacking on tools, but honestly, I feel most of the tools a person could add (though I do like saws and scissors) are not all that useful in this form anyway. Quite serviceable for a whittling knife - would be a good starter knife for a (responsible...) child or handy for a generic tool kit or camping kit. None of the tools (including the knife) is as good as the tool itself as a good single item, but most will serve if you have nothing else, which in a swiss army knife is kind of the point.Probably worth it for fifteen bucks or so...more than that and I'd consider other options. Honestly? Best bet is go to a store, look at and handle a selection and choose the one that best fits you.",4,"Good starter knife or to throw into a kit, but not the most useful swiss army knife, or the best set of tools.",1365292800,"04 7, 2013",0.144

I searched and searched with the following requirements. It had to have both a small and large blade. It needed a phillips and flat screwdriver. It also needed the punch, toothpick, and tweezers. I found what I needed in the tinker. Its two blades wide, and the length in the description is accurate, no extra bulges in my pocket.

4,A1SC7Z2646QCP9,B00004YVB4,Candid Reviewer,"[2, 4]","The Tinker is an outstanding knife with an ideal selection of the most useful every-day tool features (only the scissors is missing), and no gimmick tools to make it needlessly bulky or heavy. However, you don't actually want it. Trust me. You'll be happier with EITHER the Super Tinker or the Small Tinker depending on what you're wanting.If you're looking for ALL the ideal tools... The Super Tinker is nearly identical in size and weight, but it includes a scissors and a carrying hook. The scissors is the one useful-every-day tool that the regular Tinker lacks, so you might as well spend a couple bucks more and get the Super Tinker.If you're looking for lightweight pocketability... The Small Tinker offers the same tools as the Tinker, but in a slightly smaller package (about 1/4 shorter and slightly thinner also). You won't even notice the difference in the tool sizes, but you will notice that the Small Tinker fits nicer in your pocket and weighs a little less.Swiss Army knives are awesome, especially due to their high quality for relatively low cost. And the Tinker offers one of the best tool sets. But it pales in comparison to the Super Tinker (more tools in same size package) or the Small Tinker (same tools in a smaller, more pocket-friendly size) which offer a superior solution for every-day-tool-needs or every-day-pocket-carry, respectively.",3,"Great, but inferior to Super Tinker or Small Tinker!",1365379200,"04 8, 2013",0.5641

I have had many pocket knives over the years, but I think this ranks as the most useful. Single-bladed varieties are great for cutting, but outside of that narrow scope of competence they can leave you wanting. Nonetheless, these blades are razor sharp and stay that way for an incredible length of time. The other tools can be used for defusing a nuclear bomb, hotwiring a front-loader, or scraping gum off of your shoe.",5,How to channel your inner MacGyver,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",0.2146

It had everything that he wanted without some of the extras that can end up making it too bulky for carrying daily. Personally, I don't consider the absence of scissors to be a real loss since it is a knife and comes with a pretty sharp blade (two sharp blades actually), but that's just me. Although a locking blade is always preferred, all the implements in the SAK lock/snap into place pretty firmly and don't pose as much of a hazard as other non-locking blades. Like any Victorinox, the quality of materials is high and the expectance of performance is commensurate. It really is a classic knife.",5,A Classic SAK,1200787200,"01 20, 2008",0.1617

I find out of all of them that I carry and use the Tinker the most because of its size and tools. While the other might have more tools, I don't really use any of them and really just need a larger blade, bottle opener, philips and flathead screw driver. The large blade I can cut apples or really anything since the size is great. Some people think they need a pair of scissors but the blade is sharp enough on the smaller blade that I just use that to cut paper. The size is great too since its thinner without what I would call unnecessary tools so it easily slips into your pocket or briefcase.

Secondly, it has the essential tools needed: phillips screwdriver, flathead screwdriver, can and bottle openers, tweezers, and toothpick. The long blade and short blade are both useful and just the right size. The knife is high quality Swiss made and at a reasonable price. The small Tinker measures 3 1/4 and the regular Tinker is 3 1/2. Although 1/4 doesn't seem like a big difference, you can tell when its in your pocket. Both are great knives though.

I'm particular to higher end Spydercos but wanted something with more versatility that I could beat up and not worry about. All of the tools on the Tinker are well made with very even and smooth metal finishings. The knife came well oiled and in great condition. After a couple months of use the red scales have taken a bit of a beating and are very scratched. This doesn't bother me, though, as it's only noticeable when the knife is held at a certain angle.The size of the Tinker works very well for EDC. It's unobtrusive in my pocket but large enough to get a good grip on.

One can be kept extra sharp for cutting paper, as in cutting articles from magazines and such. The other can be used for more ordinary and varied jobs. The Phillips screwdriver is a little cumbersome because you are restricted to a 90 degree angle to the handle for its use. This makes it difficult to use when tightening the mounting screws on a door's lockset. I also ground away the square corner so the Phillips screwdriver would fit into round holes. I did square off the small screwdriver blade at the end of the can opener so it grabs better. The wire stripper is of questionable value.

This one fits the bill on every count. I already used it to open a small package in front of another employee and she didn't freak or anything! The can opener and awl blade add some versatility to the Tinker's resume as a fixer of stuff in the field, beside a creek, or if I hole up in a developed campground where a laser-guided Wundermesser isn't really called for.

18,A31PDR78F1MNDI,B00004YVB4,Smaug Jeremy,"[2, 3]","I have had three Tinkers over the years. The first one I liked best, as it was the smaller size and had a nice black handle. It is a great size to carry at all times, and forget about it until you need it. I did miss the scissors at first until I realized something. If I kept one blade razor sharp, I only very rarely needed scissors.you can use the large blade for everyday use, and just keep the small blade as a backup, always razor sharp. Another reviewer mentioned that you should remove the key ring. I agree wholeheartedly, and I went one step further. After you remove the key ring, grind down the nub that the key ring went through (with a bench grinder or Dremel grinding wheel) and it is so much smoother and fits in your pocket without poking your leg at all. The only disadvantage I can think of is that the plastic that the handles are made of are not as rugged as the rest of the knife. After carrying my first one for about 7 years and dropping it a few times, the handles loosened up and eventually fell off. Victorinox is making some newer models at a lower price point with red nylon handles. The handles are much more durable, but the Swiss cross is just painted on and looks very cheezy. My original, smaller Tinker had a philips screwdriver that was shaped to blend in to the rest of the shape. The newer ones are just round and not quite as nice. I might be ready for my fourth Tinker, hehehe. If they would just make one with the smaller body, with the rivted aluminum handles and managed to keep the toothpick and tweezers...Update: 18Apr2012 - I just bought another one of these, as I amateur welded a notch in the main blade by cutting into a live power cord. So it's pretty much ruined, unless I want to consider it a combination blade/wire stripper. I read the most recent reviews, and was pretty excited that the specs state this is the 3-1/4 model. Some reviewers mentioned that too. But the one I got is just the regular old 3-1/2 Tinker. Just something to be aware of.

It is always a good idea to clean the toothpick with soap and water after each use to avoid germs.
