3,A766OSUTLJ0Y8,B00005RCQG,J. Garceau,"[2, 2]","Ok I am on the hunt for a good pair of gloves for a young child. These gloves are almost too big and bulky. They are like having pillows on your hands. Now the problem w these youth gloves is that if u have a young child the main thing that you can do with them to give them any kind of training is to have them hit pads or hit the bag. This glove is too big and bulky for them and it is hard for them to want to make a proper fist and deliver a good punch. You need a glove that is lighter weight and hast good wrist support and probably velcro closure and good wrist support. This glove is hard to get on, not good wrist support, is too bulky, like a big pillow. It is not bad quality but just bad design for young athletes that you want to get into training. You basically want a smaller bag glove that can provide wrist support. young kids shouldnt really be competing in a boxing match or sparring but they can hit the bag & hit pads. I wouldnt even want to spar w these gloves. The kid cant even get the idea in their head to make a good punch w these. It is like if u were an adult and had 28oz gloves on it would look weird. My advice would be to skip out on these and get something else. At the moment I do not have an alternative but I am looking into Title youth training gloves with velcro strap that may be better.",3,These are just OK,1378166400,"09 3, 2013",0.1751

Seem to be well made and inexpensive other than having a fit problem. They should make them bigger with a lace up to make it easier to get them on/off and to avoid fit problems, in my opinion.",3,My daughter is 6 and small for her age and she says they are too tight,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",-0.0182
