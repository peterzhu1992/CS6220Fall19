The lasers project well and can be set to flash or remain solid. Awesome product. Hopefully it holds up.",4,Bright!,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",0.4633

This does add a bit of safety to riding in the dark, as long as the motorists pay attention.",5,Bicycle rear tail light,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",0.3216

4,A21AJ9GNCM89MK,2094869245,Greg,"[0, 0]",It's cheaply made but does what it is supposed to do. Wish it was USB rechargeable. I don't think it will survive a monsoon but light rain it can handle.,3,It's worth the price they charge.,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",0.134

8,A2A26KED39175E,2094869245,Pudknocker71,"[0, 0]",Bit bulky. One button is sticky. Works for now. Stars based on price point as well. I'll update if any significant changes occur. Very bright at this time!,5,Bulky but....,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",0.1693
9,ANKZUDSZFUMNZ,2094869245,ronald,"[0, 0]",it is bright and it has multiple settings for design and speeds. Assembling it to the bike is fast and simple.,5,rear bike light,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",0.2202
10,A2M93OC5AOMMM3,2094869245,Vette71,"[0, 0]",A mice bright light with multiple modes. I would have given it 5 stars but it is not designed to clip onto the bag on my bike. I had to midify it to do so.,4,Needed a little modification,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",0.1468
11,AO3M0AXLL0AGW,2094869245,Vic D Cope,"[0, 0]","Had one ride on the light! Mounted on my cross bike but rode it on the road. The laser worked well. Didn't spend any time adjusting for laser lines on each side of the bike like some have said in their reviews, It's simple unless you have a small bike. The laser lines are only seen when you come up about 10 feet from the bike, It's just there for the cool factor I believe. People riding next to you or a few feet behind can see the red laser lines very well. I believe the laser beams are not going to make cars more aware of the distance they need from you but it might help if they are approaching slowly.The LED light is plenty bright, just gotta make sure you aim it correctly when viewing from the rear. The mount seemed sturdy enough. Bounced bike up and down several times to see if it would slip it didn't. You can also see the LED lights from the side very well, witch I think is important. I do not know the run time since I only had one ride so far, but I assume it will be normal for LED lights. I'll try to come back and edit review (if I can) after a lot more rides.&lt;edit> I've had 4 rides on it now and still holding good charge. Works great",4,"Good light for the price, Laser iight is just a cool factor",1384214400,"11 12, 2013",0.2575
