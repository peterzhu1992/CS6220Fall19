The hard plastic wheels are slippery, make an annoying grinding sound, and they ride rough. The handle is way too short. I have to hunch over to hold it. Other less significant problems: the foot rest is too narrow so my 1 year old just drags his feet (2 year old can peddle or push with his feet fine). The best thing about it is the low seat height (1 year old can climb on easily, not so with Radio Flyer). It's also not expensive like the otherwise much better-made Kettler. Between this and the Radio Flyer, we're set until it's time for real bicycles. Trikes do tip. I think that's how boys get tough, no? or at least more careful.",3,Agree with flaws cited,1242000000,"05 11, 2009",0.0155

He is at kindergarten now, and his baby sister has just started to enjoy it as a rocker. WE left it outside for months and hosing it down makes it quite clean again every fall when we take it inside.",5,Keeps Going and Going,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",0.464

6,A2AJBEZ7VGCZEV,B00005UOSC,Katherine M. Orlopp Kt.,"[2, 2]","I am buying our third one for our third child. This is a must have for our kids between 18 months and 2 years. The one we bought seven years ago is still going, albiet with a limp. They have been used so much that the tires do wear out but the kids don't care! The six and seven year olds still love their trikes as much as they do their two wheelers and they don't seem to notice that the wheels aren't round anymore. Name one other toy you can buy for 25 bucks that lasts a kid from toddlerhood to first grade!",5,Must have!,1101081600,"11 22, 2004",0.01
7,A13X93M7A4HGW,B00005UOSC,Lolita Angelique Sherman Mommy is a Genius,"[2, 2]","OKAY! As experienced parents,we know that the multi-use items, never do one thing- really well. The 3,4,5 in 1's never quite do all that they claim. And this is no different. The rocker feature is just really stupid. It doesn't do anything. As a push trike, it will fit the bill, for sure. It has respectable durability, and is gender neutral. So for me, it's a great great value. I have toddler, boy and girl. As a stand alone trike, this is a perfect starter big wheel. The assembly was straight forward, just follow the directions to the letter, all 14 of the steps- do really matter. You need to understand the mechanics of the bike, to really get how to convert. Once you are all set, you have a quick and inexpensive alternative, to a metal bike. For a starter bike, this will do just fine, for your little one(s). The price was good, for the value.",4,3 in 1??? NOT... but here is the real deal,1309392000,"06 30, 2011",0.2033
8,A1WBEIH7Z37LN9,B00005UOSC,MagicSkip magicskip,"[0, 0]","I got this for my two year old. He already has a rocking horse (which he loves!), so I didn't bother with the rocking mode of this trike. I set it up as pictured - as a trike with the tall handle. My little guy loves it, and rides it all around the house. The only trouble is that even with the seat ALL the way forward, he can still only reach one pedal at a time. When we get better weather, we'll try it outside. My biggest concern with using it as a parent-pushed, riding toy, is that I'm not sure he'll keep his feet on the footrest -- I'm afraid he'll get a foot under it, and get his ankle twisted or jammed underneath. But, I guess we'll find out when spring comes!",4,"Too big for the little guy, but he still loves it.",1201564800,"01 29, 2008",0.1419

It came in two pieces. Really? ... The pedals were a royal pain to properly hold in place and push the plastic holder pieces in. And the foot rest for the baby? I'm still not sure I have it in right. It moves, and I don't think it should.That being said... Everything but the foot rest works on my bike. My toddler loves it!

11,A32V4TT1ZJVY2G,B00005UOSC,Sam,"[2, 2]","This is the first trike that we bought for our eldest child. We also tried the metal Schwinn tricycle, but preferred this one. It is easy for the kids to get moving and has a handy handle to help steer the kids. I am 5'11 and this height of the handle is a bit low, but not unbearable - I would have preferred 1-2 taller. My wife (5') likes the height. The wheels are supper noisy and a bit annoying but the kids don't seem to notice. I should point out that shorter kids may have difficulty pushing the pedals. My son had difficulty when he was 33 or 34 tall and had no difficulty by the time he reached 35 or 36.The trike has held up well, we have had it for about 2/2.5 years and it gets used several times a week (during good weather). We keep it outside and it power washes clean with no problems.",4,Good Trike To Learn How to Pedal,1334016000,"04 10, 2012",0.1722
