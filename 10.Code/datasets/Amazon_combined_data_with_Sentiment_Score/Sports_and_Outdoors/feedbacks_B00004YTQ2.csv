1,AJ16HQ7HA168D,B00004YTQ2,B. OBannon Ob1n,"[1, 1]","This is a very nice street hockey set. The sticks are very durable and they assemble fast with a phillips screwdriver. The net is assembled by pressing the PVC tubes into the corner joints; Easy to do! Both sticks work for left or right handers: Only slightly can you notice that one is for left and the other is for right. However, we have all kinds of neighbor kids use them and they NEVER are concerned about the &#34;proper&#34; fitting of the stick. They just use them....PERIOD! Again, a great product and price.",5,Great set!,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",0.2386

4,A1FYV6GFXF2CBW,B00004YTQ2,David,"[0, 0]","This is a great hockey net for the kids to use on the street or driveway. It's very sturdy and still light enough for my 8 year old to carry it around easily. The netting, the posts, and the sticks are all great quality for this price. This has a lot of bang for the buck. I liked it so much, I thought I was ordering two more (to keep at the in-laws) but instead I accidentally ordered Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set, White which has these flimsy little posts and I know it'll end up broken in no time. At least I have one solid net to rely on and two crappy ones as spares. I HIGHLY recommend getting this one over the Mylec Jr. Hockey Goal Set, White!!",5,Sturdy little net!,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",0.1091
5,A101QWW7PVEL5I,B00004YTQ2,D. Gaskins marketingsuperhero,"[0, 0]","Size is decent, but it is a little on the flimsy lightweight side. Tough to stand up correctly in grass, so when my daughter tries it for field hockey, the hard balls easily knock it down, and once busted apart the connections. It didn't fully break though, and with a little tightening, and lighter pucks, balls, etc. works fine. Best suited for rubber balls and street hockey on smooth surfaces.",4,Nice sport goal,1367366400,"05 1, 2013",0.1934

7,A3VSHLS9K329RP,B00004YTQ2,Potomac Hokie,"[1, 2]","This is a great gift for our kids. They use them all the time. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the construction of the goals are somewhat thin pvc piping that I worry will break easily. That said, it has stood up to some rough play so far and has provided hours of fun.",4,Kids LOVE IT!,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",0.3383
