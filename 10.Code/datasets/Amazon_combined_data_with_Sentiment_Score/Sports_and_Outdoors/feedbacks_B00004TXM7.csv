This has steel frame and nice paint job. The seat and handle bars are all adjustable for different proportions. All in all, good product that I suspect will last even with my tornado of a son.",4,"study stainless steel frame, good materials of construction",1336953600,"05 14, 2012",0.0447
1,AY12DBB0U420B,B00004TXM7,Gary Peterson,"[0, 0]","Every kid has a tricycle, don't they? Well, it's such a standard toy it almost seems so. My boy just had his third birthday so I got him a trike. It was a Radio Flyer Classic and was all decked out in red, white and chrome. Nice toy. Just as I remember from my own childhood. I got it at Toys R' Us. Too bad I didn't check Amazon as I could have saved twenty bucks plus tax.The Trike came in a box and took about 10 minutes to assemble. Real simple. When he first saw it he was afraid. That didn't last long. I rang the bell a couple times and his interest was piqued. The next day we went to a neighborhood playground and tested it. First, the trike was a little too big for him. It specified 2 1/2 to ?, but his legs weren't quite long enough. With the seat all the way down, his feet won't stand flat on the ground and with his feet on the pedals, they aren't quite long enough. No major problem. He'll grow. It's just a matter of a couple more months. I sat him on the seat and put his feet on the pedals and pushed him around the basketball court. He loved it, although his steering is going to take some training. In any case, it was a success and he wanted more.The trike is quite handsome and well built. I would j/udge that it would last and last. Some people complain about stability and I can understand. That just seems inherent in trikes. There's going to be a certain amount of bruises and scuffs. That's just part of childhood, isn't it?Gary Peterson",5,Part of Childhood.,1318118400,"10 9, 2011",0.0874
2,ABVYGB2TKBO8F,B00004TXM7,J. Donaldson Cal-diver,"[0, 0]",Our three year old has one of these. It is by far his favorite riding toy. He must have spent 50 hours riding it in the past year. It is very well built with strong materials. Other than a little wear it looks like new. It has been kept outside under the patio cover about 1/2 the time and the other 1/2 in the garage.He parked it behind our boat trailer a couple of weeks ago and I backed the trailer and bent the rear wheel. I was able to easily order a new wheel from Radio Flyer and had it fixed in a few minutes after the wheel arrived.Great product.,5,Best trike available. Quite reasonably priced given the quality.,1386115200,"12 4, 2013",0.268
3,AK9BXHEXOOM6Z,B00004TXM7,John L. Miller,"[2, 2]","We got this trike to teach our two year old how to ride. At the time he was around the same size as typical 3-4 year olds. Even with the seat all the way down, he had a lot of trouble reaching the pedals. As he got older and bigger, he was able to ride more successfully, but I would say still not comfortably. Also, getting on the trike is actually harder for him because of the stairs in back.I'd go for a different shaped trike if I had it to do again.Pro:- Solidly built- Looks great!- Fairly easy to assembleCon:- Hard for my son to get on and off- Too big for the kids most likely to ride a trike instead of a bike, IMO- Bell is quiet stiff for smaller hands- HEAVY!",3,"Built like a tank, but for BIG kids",1318550400,"10 14, 2011",0.0769
4,A1F7SX3GNVBNE3,B00004TXM7,Joshua G. Feldman Technophile,"[4, 4]","We got this for my son who never warmed to it and then handed it down to my daughter. She does not use it much either. As others have noted it is big - too tall for the little kids who really want a trike. By the time they are big enough for it - they want a bike. Lots of visiting kids seem to like it - kids in the 2-4 year old range. It LOOKS like fun - big and red. No matter what anyone does to it I can repair it. It is simple and tough. I find it touching too. Didn`t everyone have one of these when they were a kid? I try to carry it into the garage every time everyone is done (and boy is it heavy). It`s steel, so if you leave it out in the rain it will rust. Then it makes the familiar squeak squeak squeak sound when someone rides it. Just like when I was a kid!",3,"Retro beauty is big, heavy, tough, and squeak squeak squeak rustable steel.",1166572800,"12 20, 2006",0.0884

We had it outside, under a tarp and within two months, it started to rust. Once it started, the rust couldn't stop. So basically, a big waste of money.Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler.",1,Rusts Easily--Watch Out,1144454400,"04 8, 2006",-0.0396
6,AJEY5RSX7QFF7,B00004TXM7,penname,"[2, 2]",I would never buy this trike again for a child. It tips VERY easily when the child's weight leans even the slightest bit forward or to the side. Enough said. Money wasted and damage done.,1,DANGERous Tricycle,1235606400,"02 26, 2009",-0.0549

Once assembled, the unit is quite sturdy. My older grandchild was standing on the rear platform while the younger one pedaled. Not a problem. Also looks very sharp. Just tighten the seat bolt well.
