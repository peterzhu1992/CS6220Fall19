This particular knife has a good set of tools, but is small enough to carry in your pocket without being a pain in the buttocks. In my opinion, both Victorinox and Wenger knives are top notch.",5,and useful. This particular knife has a good set of ...,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",,0.486
3,A3UOSNSYF9F9PV,B00004YVBA,"[0, 0]","I've been buying a collection of the SAKs from Amazon, but this one I bought from Target when I was in the store. Mine's the SilverTech version and it looks really cool. The Climber is exactly the same knife as the Super Tinker, except the Climber has the corkscrew and the Super Tinker has the Phillips. I own both models, and am I'm torn between the two. I used to think I couldn't live without the Phillips and had no use for the corkscrew, but my opinion is changing slightly. They're both terrific, but lately I've been favoring models with the corkscrew over the Phillips and here's why:- The dedicated Phillips screw driver is a bit redundant because the can opener tip works well for Phillips screws.- More often than not I find the dedicated Phillips tip too large for most of the Phillips screws I come across.- The corkscrew can be a 2-in-1 tool, since it can house the mini screw driver.- Since there's already a usable Phillips tip on the can opener, having the Climber with the corkscrew provides two more tools than the Super Tinker with the Phillips.- Lastly, in the rare occasion I've used the Super Tinker's Phillips on deck screws, sometimes such larger screws require more torque, which requires more pressure on the tool, and I've had the Phillips collapse on my finger. Ouch! Other SAK models which have the square-shaft Phillips on the END of the knife (as opposed to the center) work much better for heavy duty use. But that center-mounted Phillips makes me just want to get a regular screw driver.I love both models though, and if you're really that torn over which model to get, why not just get both? I would welcome any comments and perspectives regarding your opinion on the Phillips vs. the Corkscrew.Thanks for reading my review.Cheers!",5,The Climber SilverTech - it's sweet!,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",Amazon Vinny,0.331

It is amazing that a 125 year old company is still coming up with something new and really in tune with the times.A little thinner than my usual Explorer, with everything important, lacking only the magnifying glass and Phillips screwdriver.I always have to say that Victorinox is definitely THE brand of Quality for SAK's. Their factory-original blades last longer than Wenger, and much longer than ****ty Chinese knock-offs, most of which are nearly impossible to resharpen.",5,Cool Tech,1361750400,"02 25, 2013",California Doug,0.4803

8,A3U1NLCVPFM3KV,B00004YVBA,"[1, 1]","The blades are really, really sharp, compared to the (at least) 20-year-old well-worn Wenger this replaced when the Wenger was lost somewhere. This one has a few more tricks, so it's a bit fatter. Not sure I needed them, but there they are. I like having a knife and a corkscrew around. The screwdriver blades are rarely useful, the scissor a bit more useful once-in-a-while. The hook? Oy. I do like the hole punch-reamer belt-hole maker thing. There's a toothpick I'll lose, also the pretty much useless tweezers. Take the cost of these things, spread it out over however many years they last... good deal.",5,Good ol' Swiss Army Knife,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",M. Frobisher,0.0473
