0,A31KI13F4W285R,B00002ND6V,Amazon Customer,"[0, 3]","First trip, I filled 2/3 of this cooler with ice then lay it on its side on a roof rack. A day later, I got it off the top of the car and although some ice had melted, I was amazed that nothing leaked from the lid. Filled the cooler up with water at that point and 2 days later, still had a little bit of ice.Second trip, filled about 1/3 with ice and water to about 3/4 full. Next day, most of the ice was gone even though outside temps were about the same as trip #1.So now I know not to skimp on ice (I already don't like drinking water so if I have to it better be ice cold) but I'm impressed the lid holds so securely. The spout is easy to operate with one hand and our 5-year old has no problems with it. Handles feel sturdy and are comfortable enough to carry a full jug with just one.",4,"Not the best insulator, but no leaks!",1322438400,"11 28, 2011",0.4837
1,A3QNQQKJTL76H0,B00002ND6V,buru buru piggu,"[0, 1]","This is a very big water cooler that is handy to have around for gatherings and outdoor events. I fill it with ice tea for BBQ's in my backyard and have gotten a lot of good use out of it. Build quality is excellent and construction is sturdy. A grown adult can even sit on this with no problem. It's a nice, attractive bright orange color that's fun to look at and easy to spot. The side has a cup holder, but I never use it as it's clumsy to keep attached.The spigot is easy to push and automatically shuts off when its released. It enables one-handed operation: use your fingers to grip the cup and your thumb to push the spigot, important when you're trying to juggle several things at once. The spigot does not leak or drip. Because the spigot is positioned low on the unit, you do have to place the cooler on the edge of a table or other raised surface so you can get a cup under it. Gravity draws liquid out.I'm very satisfied with this cooler.",5,"Big, sturdy cooler",1282003200,"08 17, 2010",0.3507

3,A35BVGABICURHM,B00002ND6V,D. Stafford,"[0, 0]",Very durable construction. Just like I remember as a kid at soccer games this cooler will be for my kids to drink out of at their soccer games. The spout is so easy to operate my 5 year old can use it. Will probably buy some more of these for camping.,5,For life,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",0.2347
