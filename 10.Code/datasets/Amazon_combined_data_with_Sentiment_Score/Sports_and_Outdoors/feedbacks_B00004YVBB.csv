I've had maybe 15 in that 40 year period and none was ever broken or failed to work in any way. I think they were all stolen by people who realized how utilitarian they are. I just chalk it up to fact that the thieves were jealous of my owning something so perfect for their pocket.,5,The name in Pocket Knives is Victorinox.,1404172800,"07 1, 2014",-0.0508

2,A38FIQ4QJ2522J,B00004YVBB,Jose Bassist d'oh?,"[0, 0]","i basically wanted these for the larger scissors and extra blade. while I rarely use these blades, I like having options and keep them razor sharp. the I mainly use this for when I'm bored at work and file my nails or trim my 'stache. I've yet to use the orange peeler but it's pretty sharp so i don't see why it wouldn't be able to peel and orange. it's about half an inch longer than the classic.",5,much larger than the classic,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",0.1473

6,AHNCSRONCAQ5F,B00004YVBB,M. N. Heyes,"[0, 0]","This is a really nice pocket knife, hurry and get one before you come down with scurvy!The next time I buy some oranges I'm going to try out this orange peeler blade.The file is nice and the scissors are noticeably better than on the 58mm (smallest) SAKs, and those scissors aren't even all that bad.I think that this may be one of the best compromises in size vs utility - it is very easy to pocket but comes with some nice tools.It is also not a bad choice to pair with a SAK or multi-tool that doesn't come with scissors.",5,Wow - this is a nice Swiss Army Knife!,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",0.9465
7,AJZUFPKKMOO3X,B00004YVBB,Newguy,"[8, 8]",I bought mine when i was in my teens and have had it ever since. I have lost it a few times and came across it usually during a move or when I was looking for something else. Always happy to see it. It fits nicely in the small change pocket above the right front pocket of my levis. Its not to big at all and great for everyday stuff. My son will surely get this one when he is of age.,5,Great little pocket knife,1204848000,"03 7, 2008",0.2932
8,AF3RUP756SG4R,B00004YVBB,Rapid1,"[0, 0]","This is the sweet spot for pocket carry Swiss Army knives. A bit larger than the classic, with larger scissors and a larger knife blade, but not as bulky or large as the standard sized which are more effective but a bit larger than I like in my pocket. I still haven't peeled an orange with it so I can't comment on that aspect of that blade but it does work well opening packages, especially the frustrating plastic ones. This one is with me at all times...",5,Just right.,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",0.2267
9,A1EPNJ5ZFCJNUQ,B00004YVBB,R. Tompson randyt5194,"[6, 6]","I'm a businessman and a former Boy Scout. I like to Be Prepared, and that includes carrying a small pocketknife with me (except when I'm flying).I've owned between 10 and 20 of this particular model of knife in 20+ years. Why so many? Well, some of them I lost... some were borrowed by my children and never returned... some were abandoned at TSA security areas when I forgot to slip the knife into my checked luggage... some are in my desk at work as an emergency reserve. And I always worry Victorinox will stop making this model, so I buy ahead.For me, this is the perfect pocketknife.- It has a great selection of blades... the large and small drop point.. the fingernail cleaner/file... the scissors are the best scissors I've found on many a pocket knife (on many others the blades are serrated, or the spring is misaligned, or too weak/strong)... and it's amazing how often I use the orange peeler!- The steel is gorgeous, never stains. It stays sharp for a long time (I sharpen it with a diamond stick maybe twice a year)- I use the toothpick for lots of tasks, from tooth hygiene to marlinspike for small problem knots.- It's comfortable to carry in a pants pocket. Too many of the Swiss Army Knives are so loaded down with less useful implements, and too thick/heavy for business trousers.- Hinge tension is perfectly balanced. The blades open easily without breaking a fingernail, but keep the blades securely inside the handle.Any Boy Scout will tell you that a knife is the very most important tool you can carry. With a knife you can make rope, which is the second most important thing you can have in a survival situation. With knife and rope you can make shelter, acquire food and water. With a knife you can make fire, defend yourself.In addition to my various copies of this knife, I own another dozen or so knives for other purposes: Multitools, hunting knives, a folding knife for opening mail, and the kitchen knives of course. But this is my workhorse knife, the one I carry on my person.",5,My favorite pocket knife,1300492800,"03 19, 2011",0.2321
10,A2V3VDW9M2X353,B00004YVBB,T. Lewis,"[1, 2]","The Executive is perfect. I've owned one since spring of 2006 and it has never let me down since. I lost it once but my dog found it for me. I think the size of this knife is perfect, it is not as small as they come nor as big as they come. It is still big enough for heavy use however. This knife is a better option than the big Victorinox knife.I used to think that the tweezers, toothpick, orange-peeler, and nail file were pretty much useless, but they really arn't. I can't go a day now without all these tools! These knives will last forever...I promise....but they will scratch and so on. But who cares ya'll! This is the perfect knife and gift for anyone who loves good ol' fashioned quality.Buy this knife!!!!",5,P.E.R.F.E.C.T.,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",0.2585
