0,A16AMRVH5VLUSX,B00005BHNT,AR72704,"[0, 0]",These goggles were a gift for a boy who just learned to swim. Now he has a whole new world since he can open his eyes in the water. This was a big hit.,5,Opened up a whole new world for a 1st time swimmer!,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",0.1468
1,ARCIZ45QALD7B,B00005BHNT,Greg,"[0, 0]","My 10 year old son loves these goggles and they fit perfect. The silicone strap is very stretchy and durable. Strap length was easy to adjust. The eye gaskets are soft and seal very well. No water leaks! The lenses are darker than what they appear in the picture, but my son loves the all black look. I'd buy these again.",5,Excellent goggles at a good price.,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",0.2877

3,A2JIYYKV28AMCP,B00005BHNT,Joe Camper,"[0, 0]","Bought 2 sets of these, one for my 9 year old son and one for my 7 year old daughter. They fit perfectly on both, don't leak, and don't fog up. The kids say they're pretty comfortable too. Can't ask for much more than that in this price range. Would buy again definitely.",5,Great goggles,1350172800,"10 14, 2012",0.3977
4,AVNJQY22L103F,B00005BHNT,L. Romano,"[0, 0]",My 3 year old is in swim lessons and these were required. He did not fight much about wearing them so I am guessing they have to be pretty comfortable. Looks super cool on...he gets comments all the time!,5,my 3 year old looks cool in these,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",0.5279
5,A16CW6JV46H1RW,B00005BHNT,nsheaves,"[0, 0]",My son wears these and seems to really like them. He doesn't have much trouble with them filling up with water while swimming and they stay fairly fog-free. They do sit close to the eye and his eyelashes get squished against them.,4,close to eyelashes,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",0.243
6,A31ZO2G7KA11AR,B00005BHNT,Poppies_rule,"[0, 0]",These goggles are 5 stars as far as function. They seal well. They are comfortable. They have flat lenses so there is not visual distortion. But after only 6 months of use they rubber that seals to your face is cracking and brittle. Didn't expect them to last forever but I was hoping at least a year. They are more affordable if you buy them in 3 packs.,3,"Great function, not so great durability.",1404777600,"07 8, 2014",0.1937
7,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00005BHNT,Robert I. Hedges,"[11, 12]","I recently started swimming as an adult. Chlorine bothers my eyes a great deal, and I asked my swimming teacher to recommend a good pair of goggles. He recommended Speedo Hydrospex. I immediately went for the adult size, but he explained that the most important aspect of a good fit was the sizing and shape of the eye cups, particularly if you have a narrower face. We then tried on all three sizes Speedo makes, starting with the smallest for children. They were clearly too small, and we moved on to these, the Junior Hydrospex Classics, which I also expected to be too small. I was wrong. They were a perfect fit for the geometry of my face. The adult goggles were OK but a tad too large and I think I would have had much more leaking with them.Despite being an adult, I fit the Junior Hydrospex perfectly, and I am grateful to my instructor for having me test fit these. The moral of the story is clear: if at all possible try on the goggles you're looking at before buying as you could be surprised about what fits best.I got the clear goggles (I tried the tinted ones and they were too dark for my preference) and have had no problems with leaking or fogging. They are comfortable and keep my eyes mercifully free of chlorine. I have been swimming with them twice a week for a few months now, and they are holding up well so far. I highly recommend Speedo Hydrospex Classics to anyone doing a lot of swimming: just make sure you get the right size for your face.",5,Great Goggles; Check Your Size Before Buying,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",0.4607

9,A3C9BNVWKPFB5X,B00005BHNT,SF,"[0, 0]","I just got a second pair of these for my 7 year old. The first pair lasted through about 6 months of weekly swim lessons, and all the extra swimming in the summer. The goggles fit better than any we've tried before - no leaks, no marks, no wining.",5,Best affordable kid goggles,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",0.2388
10,A1Y24I34B8Z2SO,B00005BHNT,srings,"[0, 0]","My son was on our local pool swim team. Between meets and just splashing around in the pool, I'd say they worked great. No leaks (if put on right). He loved them. Hope they last through next year. So far so good!",4,Perfect for summer swimming,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",0.3374
11,A3O0SS8V2QMHP4,B00005BHNT,Toaster,"[1, 1]",Little 8 year old loves these. Easy to use and love the dark lenses. Next time I will buy the Aqua Sphere Kayenne for her though because they are so much easier to use. They have a sliding buckle that adjusts the head band and she fits into them.,5,Great,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",0.4603
