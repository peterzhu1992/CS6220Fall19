This was amazing: filled queen air mattress in what felt like a minute. Somewhat more expensive but it's rechargeable so you're not investing in fairly expensive D batteries every year. If you have a pool at home or go to beach a lot, this would be great for instantly inflating air mattresses, etc.",5,"borrowed one, awesome",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",0.342

I was hoping they improved it to be quieter, but not at all. Maybe worse. (I checked. Wal-Mart has it.)The noise level can be annoying in your back yard or home. More so at a campsite where people are trying to get away from noisy and rude. To me, its piercing whine screams careless design.Consider using a good quality foot pump (good ones can cost $40). They never run out of juice, although they're not as fast or easy.I don't use the deflation feature. Large-valve mattresses will self deflate in a few minutes.PROs:~~> Fast inflation of Boston valve type mattresses, such asIntex Downy Twin Bed~~> You don't have to feed it batteries, like the D-cell version~~> Coleman now sells replacement nozzles at their site. This bumps my review up to 3-starsCONs:~~> Noisy, rude.~~> Limited capacity in wilderness (probably about 10-12 twin size mattress inflations)~~> Manual asks you to recharge every 3-5 months, even if not used (Not convenient.)~~> No case (cheap soft-sided cooler or lunch box works well)",3,"Convenient, Rude",1296086400,"01 27, 2011",-0.1115

Maybe in that powerful mode it can't be lower noise. Anyway it is embarrassing if your air mattress leaks during midnight. It will wake up a few friends, let alone your family on the mattress.The battery lasts very long. It brings another side effect of heavier overall weight to other products.But I still recommend this to you.

9,A1XE3M22N91451,B00005JD40,Huckleberry,"[4, 4]","We've gone through quite a few cigar-lighter plug in pumps over the years, and the choice was always do I pull the truck right up to the tent door and risk dusting the tent floor from the fan, or inflate the mattresses at the truck and cram them through the door, possibly hitting a sharp stick or rock on the way?Then, sometimes you get that mattress with a leak so small you can't find it, but after a few hours on cold ground with 210 (or 320 if you're lucky and Mrs comes along) pounds forcing it out, you get a less than firm sleeping situation, and neither option seems very appealing at zero dark thirty in the cold. This one is right there next to you, so you can adjust the bed any time.No need to agonize over such decisions now.Amazingly, it held it's only charge all summer, and pumped up a queen and twin mattress on at least 5 trips. We live in cold country, so warmer weather will tell if it's astounding in that regard or just awesome, but so far, although I was hesitant about buying a rechargeable, so good.Plenty of tips, almost as useful for DEflating as inflating, and it fills them MUCH faster than our old plug-in unit. It's quite a bit bigger than the plug-in it replaces, but being able to take it into the tent more than makes up for that. Chinese Coleman isn't always as good as US Coleman used to be, but this little guy is everything I would expect and more.The last thing to consider is that a 12 to 120v converter AND this pump cost less than a good quality 12v pump alone, and move much more air to boot (and the cordless part isn't even figured in). If the battery continues to take and hold it's charge, I think we have a winner.",5,Much better than expected,1333929600,"04 9, 2012",0.2268

They worked, but I had to hold them on my mattress just right, otherwise they would just blow everywhere. This one, on the other hand, fits right into the mattress and inflates in the blink of an eye, hands-free. I would have given it 5 stars if it had a tie or something with which to attach the nozzles to the pump, to avoid losing them.

The Coleman was a full .5 too small (diameter) to work with my Simmons and wouldn't fit my Aerobed either.The battery is a lead one, and not light. The quickpump running without a bed attached also seemed to be twice as noisy versus the 120V plug-in charger for the Simmons bed-- very much not quiet.For my purposes, and because of the noise level, Not Recommended.

It pretty much works on everything, even from large valve air mattresses to those screw type valves found on the Therma-Rest brand. The small thin point adapter takes care of pillows and every kid toy I can imagine that uses plug stoppers. A single charge lasts forever. About 50 uses and it hasn't died on me yet.But god it's noisy. Nothing ruins the mood of a serene and peaceful camp site more than this thing. The high speed whine it makes will scare off wildlife for miles I think. (Maybe in bear country that's a good thing). Use it early before your neighbors go to bed. Can't imagine what this thing sounds like indoors. Never tried.I debated about taking a single star of the rating because of the noise but I think that's just being too nit-picky and unrealistic given the price.

The reason I decided on this was because:(1) of the name-brand,(2) the fact that it seemed to be very handy with its recharging abilities and with its lightweigh features,(3) the fact that my lungs cannot substitute for the action of my machine superior,(4)and because it came with more accessories that were easily seen inside its packaging than all the other pumps on display at the time (perhaps not the best reasoning behind a buy, but the one I used anyhow).Happily, I can profess that I made the right decision and that I actually get use out of this model long after the bed decided to enter the plastic graveyard. In fact, it was the main reason the bed lasted as long as it did, holding its charge for days at a time while I tried to find the looming lungs that seemed to only exhale from somewhere inside its interior. Equally quaint was the accessory that let it work as a deflation tool, allowing me to take air out in moments instead of having to work and maneuver the last gasps out of something that wished to defy me.These days I take it with me everywhere, using this beast to place air in inflatable chairs that I carry to crowded homes with minimal seating arrangements and when I feel like doing something on the proverbial fly.
