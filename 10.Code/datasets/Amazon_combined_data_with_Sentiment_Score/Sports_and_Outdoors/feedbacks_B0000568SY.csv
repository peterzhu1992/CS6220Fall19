3,A19AIVXSO40F90,B0000568SY,Gene,"[0, 0]","My 8 yr old son loves his scooter again. The rear wheel on his original scooter was so worn out from using the brake that it was making a noise every time he used it. I decided it was time to replace his wheels.These wheels worked great and come with their own bearings (so you do not have to reuse the old bearings). I believe the bearings are rated ABEC 5 (though I cannot be 100% certain). ABEC 5 are what are found on most skateboards and scooters in the US. Some models from China are rated ABEC 3 which are to be avoided. These wheels roll about the same as the original razor wheels, which is why I'm inclined to believe they are ABEC 5. Overall, I am very satisfied with these new wheels.",5,Perfect replacements wheels,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",0.1625
