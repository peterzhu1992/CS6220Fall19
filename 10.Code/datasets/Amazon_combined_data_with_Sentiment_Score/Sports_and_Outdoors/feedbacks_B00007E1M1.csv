Lost one, bought another knife for some variety, and have retired that one in favor of the Flash II once again as my every day carry knife.Pros:- Lightweight- Pretty small knife overall, but the blade is large enough to be capable of basically any normal job.- Assisted opening allows for quick deployment, but it stays closed even without using the lock.- Sturdy- The blade holds an edge- Very sharp out of the box- Offered in a variety of blade types. (I have owned the Tanto, and now this partially serrated version)Cons:- The clip has a tendency to get hung up on things, but it's a fixable issue. Just remove the clip with a hex wrench and bend both ends down so that A) it has a smaller opening at the end and is less likely to be hung up on things and B) so that it has a tighter hold generally.- I'd rather not have the lock. You can use a carefully applied drop of super glue to disable it if you like.- It can be closed with one hand, but you could definitely get cut if you aren't careful.

6,A1VLY2GSXC19ST,B00007E1M1,Gary,"[1, 1]","Background:The Spyderco Tenacious and the SOG Flash II are popular choices and because I have both in half serrated, and they are in the same price range, I compare them both here. The flash II is more popular in stores and I think Wal-Mart even sell them.I have had and still have several Flash II's and one Spyderco Tenacious. I have carried both as EDC for extended periods in tough use, so thought I would add my experience with them. I currently carry the flash II and a SAK, but carried the Tenacious and SAK for about a year and still have it and prefer it in the woods. I have carried Benchmade's, but they are a little expensive and I fear loosing one. I fly the airlines a lot on spur of the moment notice and have given several knives including at least two Flash's to TSA having no time to go back and store/ship it or something. I gave one to some Mexicans doing drywall work in the terminal in front of TSA screening rather then give it to TSA. I try to keep a knife in my desk, boat, backpack, and a couple of cars. So more expensive knives haven't been indicated for me.I carry a folder clipped inside the pocket (clip outside), with the point down, weak hand side.Spyderco Tenacious:Pros:Solid construction. Feels better then the Flash in use (in the hand). It has Stainless Steel liners under the G10 scales. It is more conventional and probably stronger then the Flash.Good blade steel. Better then the Flash II IMO. The 8Cr13MoV sounds better when sharpening too. Ha. But, that may be due to the heaver construction of the whole knife, less dampening due to the aluminum sides under the G10, and the thinner blade near the edge (flat ground). So even though the edge is thinner, and I have put a finer angle edge on it, the Tenacious holds an edge better.Blade shape - really nice for a wide variety of tasks with a wide leaf shape. Leaves plenty of room to get your thumb against the spider hole to open the knife.Good lock up. I don't like liner locks much, but it locks solidly and secure.Size of the Blade. I like this size knife for EDC.Easy enough to open with either hand.The belt clip is more durable and versatile then the Flash. The Flash clip breaks at one of the multiple 90 bends. The Tenacious clip is lower profile, stronger, grips better in a pocket, and can be mounted up, down, left and right.Cons:Difficulty closing with one hand: I am not a big fan of liner locks, but I like them much better then spring detent locks like old school pocket knives. I pretty much cut a thumb pad off once with a Tenacious so maybe some of it is psychological. You can get your thumb caught and sliced in the blade trying to close it with one hand. Just pushing the liner lock in will will drop the blade against your thumb if you hold it in the wrong position. Not a problem with two hands using the other one to control the blade closing, but with a bolt lock on the side you can close it with one hand and never need to get your finger/thumb under where the blade goes. This doesn't happen with a assisted opening knife as the blade is always trying to open until almost closed.Heavy (this is not a big thing for me, but it is noticeably heaver then a flash due to partial aluminum sides under the G10).Made in China. But, quality and steel is very good in the case of this knife, so Made in China is more about ethics and politics then quality in this case.SOG Flash IIPros:Assisted opening. Get it past 5 or 10 with light pressure on the thumb and it snaps open. Great one handed operation, even if injured. A little more wow, or cool, factor then the Tenacious.Light weight. Feels quite a bit lighter then the Spyderco. Perhaps even less then substantial (personal preference). The flash is all plastic actually glass-reinforced nylon (GRN). It has some kind of metal bushing between the blade and (GRN) sides.Size of the Blade. I like this size knife for EDC.Lock up is solid, as far as staying open/not closing. There is a little slop though when open in both directions. I have never tried to tighten it up. I have never worried about it closing on me in use.Safety. You can lock it so it wont open in your pocket.Easy to sharpen.Made in USACon's:Slop when open. Not bad, but not as tight as the Tenacious.Safety - I have had it come open in my pocket a couple of times in active situations. It wasn't locked when this happened. Pretty scary. I knew it was open, or partially open; in one case when I reached in my pocket and cut a fingers, and two other times when I felt the point sticking into the front of my hip. In the later two I stopped moving and then moved real slowly until I got it folded back up and under control. Front pocket, bad place for an open knife. For some reason a Benchmade Barrage assisted open has never come open in my pocket (even unlocked). Of course the Benchmade is a great knife, but at more then twice the cost. I think the flash lacks a tendency to stay closed. Better spring assisted knives seem to have more force toward closed until you pass the point where it springs toward open. It's not like the safety is a plus, so much as it is just plain needed, because of the tenancy to come open if the thumb nut is bumped in the pocket. However, the safety will come off, or turn on, in pocket. This further aggravates the above problem.Steel is softer then Tenacious and doesn't hold an edge nearly as well. Easy to ding and dull the edge. Supposed to be AUS-8, 56-58 Rockwell (same hardness as Tenacious's Chinese 8Cr13MoV, but I perceive all three Flashes to be softer than and not hold an edge as well as the Tenacious based on use and response when sharpening ).I have broken 2 belt clips. SOG replaced them for free though. There is a place on there web sight for this.Belt clip can be mounted for left or right but not up or down. It only mounts for point down (that is it will be point down if opened).Fairly complicated to disassemble if needed to clean. Goes with the territory for an assisted.The glass-reinforced nylon (GRN) frame may feel cheap to some. It doesn't have any metal liners, but is very strong and works well.Summary:I like both knives for different reasons.I give the edge to the Tenacious for the Blade design & hardness, build construction, and belt clip. Opening is good and easy but requires moving the blade all the way open, or a strong flip on a well broken in knife.The Flash II is lighter (may be good or bad). I like the bolt action lock better, mainly for ease of closing with one hand, and the spring assist opening it great. The flash has more pzazz.Both knives are about the same price $30 to $45 depending on options and seller at the time of this post, with the Spyderco starting on the lower end of the overlap price range and the Flash topping out the range.A cross between these with the Spyderco blade design and steel, assisted opening and an axis type lock like the Flash, would be real cool. Better then either one IMO. My Benchmade Barrage is the best of both worlds or better, and I like it better (who wouldn't), but too expensive for EDC for me.Conclusion:Even though this is my EDC knife, I have to say the Spyderco Tenacious may be the more practical and possibly a better choice for most applications. It has better steel, seems to be stronger, better blade shape, etc. I still carry the flash because of the assist, weight, and the safety issues. It's almost like it's not there.Best choice is to get them both.Hope this helps someone decide.",4,My current EDC knife.,1385337600,"11 25, 2013",0.1971
7,A3TA1A3PXA42T4,B00007E1M1,George S. Nieldan,"[0, 0]","I already own one of these as an EDC knife and that is why I have purchased more. This knife is quite sharp out of the box and it opens quickly. I like the safety feature that locks the blade so that it doesn't open accidentally. The best feature for me is the low profile clip that allows the knife to be carried but not seen. It is elevated a bit off the end of the knife so that no part of the knife shows outside your pocket. All that is visible is the clip. Most knifes have a small portion of the knife end that sticks out of the pocket. With this style of knife, you can't see any of the knife outside the pocket. This makes this a discreet EDC knife that is also functional and of an excellent quality.The handle is quite sturdy and has textured feel that increases the grip. The partially serrated blade is quite helpful in getting through boxes, rope, plastic, etc. Overall this is a lightweight and handy knife that is worth the price and superb for EDC. If it is stiff or doesn't open the way you like, just adjust the end screw and lubricate it with a drop of oil. I have also used WD-40 on this style of knife and it does wonders cleaning it and making it look brand new again.",5,Excellent Every Day Carry (EDC) Knife,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",0.1859
8,AOU5JPGKD601J,B00007E1M1,Greek Monkey,"[0, 0]","As a knife, the SOG Flash II is good. Not great, but good.The grip feels too flimsy for you to trust it as a work-horse knife. I certainly wouldn't want to use it for more than light utility, for fear of the handle coming apart.The blade is too thin to allow for much prying or to be used as a heavy-cutter (I would not, for example, want to use it as a survival knife; i.e. tapping on with a branch to wedge-cut kindling apart). Though the partial serration works well for cutting most anything.But, of course, none of that is why you're buying the Flash II. It's a combat-style tactical folder, and for that it's pretty dang solid.The assisted opening works well; shaving a few tens of a second off of the opening-time for other lock-blades of this type.The handle is shaped fine for all three standard knife-fighting grips (forward, reversed, and side-gripped with thumb on flat of blade)...though it lacks any kind of metal for breaking windows, etc.The blade itself holds an edge well, and has a shape conducive to both cuts and thrusts. The ambidextrous thumb studs, and reversible belt-clip, make it good regardless of how you carry and open it.The lock is easily engaged for simple one-handed closing.All in all, it's a great tactical lock-blade for the price.",4,"Quick opening, decently useful",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",0.3767

12,AHG634U7GYEN1,B00007E1M1,Knife junky,"[0, 0]","I like this knife for the following reasons. It is sharp, lightweight, cool looking, and rugged. This knife is easy to operate with one hand because of the assisted opening feature. I own the newest version of this model which now has the arc lock instead of the piston lock. With the arc lock it is much easier on the finger to unlock the blade when folding it up (huge upgrade). SOG has also added jimping to the finger groove area to get a better grip. A couple of things I do not like about this knife is the blade play from right to left when opened and in the locked position, you can tighten the pivot screw to get rid of this play. Also there is blade play up and down just slightly when in the locked position (can't do much about that). Finally SOG put's an electronic anti-theft stick plate on the inside of the handle which can be removed if you take the handle apart. Why they do this is beyond me because most manufacturers put those stickers on the inside of the packaging. Not a deal breaker but it can be annoying! Overall a great knife and I would recommend it knowing it needs a few tweaks to tighten the blade and lose the theft sticker.",4,Great knife but it needs a few tweaks!,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",0.2674
13,A1HZN52SAYAQTN,B00007E1M1,Lightbearer2012,"[0, 0]","I bought this USA made SOG at Lowe's for 49 bucks on a total impulse buy. I wanted and could have got it about $10 cheaper with the plain blade(which I much prefer)on amazon but I was itching to buy a new knife(ever happen to you?)so i bought this one with the serrated blade.The knife came in a clampack/lockbar combo that was unpleasantly tedious to remove the knife Ifrom but well protected from damage of any kind. The fact that a lot of cheap chinese made knives come wrapped in tissue and in nice boxes and a knife like this doesn't really chaps my arse but it is what it is.At first feel this knife can come across plasticky due to the handle design and material used but that quickly goes out the window after carrying and using this knife for awhile. It is textured but I would not call it grippy although the shape of the handle does feel solid and secure in my large hands. A weak attempt at jimping on the top and choil area of the handle is appreciated but disappointing. The handle is liner-less to reduce weight but this knife is strong and rigid. This knife is light for its size making it great for edc purposes. The pocket clip designs on these SOG's is the best in my opinion as the knives totally disappear into your pocket.The quality blade is razor sharp out of the package on mine and is a decent steel(AUS 8 or equivalent I believe). I don't like serrations myself but these did make short work out of rope and cord. The blade is beautiful and the SOG Flash II logo looks cool on the blade but the patent # on the other side is kind of lame. This is a USA made knife as is my SOG Trident but it is displayed nowhere on the knives themselves which really steams my clams if you know what I mean. The thumbstuds are of good design and are not too smooth nor too rough and a slight push causes the blade to really fly open.The action on this knife is awesome and fun to deploy repeatedly. Zero blade play in this example but after about 200-300 openings and closings it developed slight left to right but very slight so a minor adjustment to the pivot screw and it is back to being solid and fast. I love the sound it makes as it locks up! The arc lock is simple and safe and grows on you after awhile. The safety lock is a cool idea but as most have stated it can be tedious after repeated usage. Even unlocked I do not fear it opening in my pocket on accident.Overall this knife is the one if you have medium to large hands because for me the Flash I is just too small.

I've had the typical issues that seem to crop up with this knife. The belt clip can get a little loose and it does crack the handle, but I tightened it up and stopped carrying it in my pocket (it rides in my Maxpedition Jumbo). I also had some sideways play in the blade and again tightening the thing worked well.The blade deploys quickly, but you need to follow through. Light pressure on the lug will result in the blade not opening all the way and not locking into place. It's sharp and holds an edge reasonably well, the safety is a nice peace of mind feature, but is probably not strictly necessary.One thing to be mindful of is that if you pull this knife out and flip it open, it's large enough that it'll flip some people out. I've had a few instances in which people have given me sideways glances when I use it to open boxes, etc. If you find this to be an issue for you consider the Flash I or a non-assisted blade.I am enjoying the knife and it has served to interest me in other SOG products so, that's either an endorsement or a warning depending on the size of your pocketbook, I guess.Good Knife, Good Price, very useful.",4,Definitely lives up to it's reutation,1244937600,"06 14, 2009",0.1834

Knife is aus 8 which is decent steel, factory sharp, fairly thick steel.Pros:Steel is good quality for this price point of knife. Much more durable (as far as holding an edge) than similar chinese kershaw 8cr13mov. This isn't a chinese knife but it's an assembled in the US. Based on the steel my guess is this is primarily taiwan (for the steel) and/or chinese for the rest. Chinese knives are usually 8cr13 or 8cr14 that's why I say this. Taiwan metal working is actually pretty good when it comes to tools nowadays (about 90% of professional American metal work with similar materials) so there's no real problem with it.Safety is great, works, and you will use it because of the action.Handle is well designed for non-optimal condition use (i.e. grease, soil, water, etc).Cons:Clip design isn't great for removing the knife from a pocket (have to grip the knife oddly to remove it).The assisted action of the knife is way too fast for this type of knife. I'm not saying that it's dangerous but it has the potential to be if you're not paying attention.Blade lock is a bit goofy, it doesn't really lock in place when the blade is deployed.Altogether for the money I paid (20 bucks), this is a great knife. Though the design doesn't match the proposed function. This is supposed to be a general use (actually contractor grade from the package) knife and it's a bit too pseudo-tactical for my tastes.

The Blur is my favorite knife and I consider it the best value of any knife I own. This knife compares favorably to the Blur. I still prefer the Kershaw Blur, but both knives are excellent choices and represent great value.

I know because I called the company and they said this to me. I really don't think they would lie about something like that. Do you?",4,Good knife,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",0.0071

The Flash series of SOG knives really are great, they flick open with ease, and are very small. It is a great folder. Only two things about this knife I dont like which are the slight steep pricing, and the handle quality. Overall an excellent folder.",4,"cool knife, ok price",1144454400,"04 8, 2006",0.429
