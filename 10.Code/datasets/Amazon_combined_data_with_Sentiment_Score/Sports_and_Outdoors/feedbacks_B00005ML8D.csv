I think its great, but it hasn't made it to my keychain for that very reason.",4,"Great, but thick",1378166400,"09 3, 2013",0.477

And toothpicks can be used for things other than picking teeth.***I have five Swiss Army Knives, from the next to smallest to one that is about 4 long and has 12 blades. All have a scissors and, of course, one primary knife blade, but there are two that I carry with me most often. This is the second handiest because it is still small and unobtrusive, and has the basic tools that I use most often: small blade, emergency blade, cut and picker blade, scissors, nail file with cleaner, ruler with screwdriver, cuticle pusher, tweezers, and retractable pen,To be honest, I got this because of the retractable pen which I wanted for emergencies such as writing down a phone number while on a walk or trek. However, although years ago I never would have thought of using the toothpick, I really miss it and it was replaced by the pen. Hey, I'm older. Food gets stuck, and the toothpick is there. Can't get it out with the pen. I wish they had left out the cuticle pusher. Pushing cuticles can wait till I get home. In fact, I don't remember ever pushing a cuticle...I suppose I should have complained about the loss of the toothpick - especially after Amazon lists it in the tools - but I have used the pen once. Wrote the number on my palm for the owner of a lost cat that I happened to find. (Funny thing was that I had my Sony MP3 player with me, but forgot that it also records so the pen is actually superfluous.) The cat and owner were appreciative, and I turned down the reward although I could have bout the smaller knife.I carry the smaller knife (don't know which one, but it has two blades - no pen - and is about 2/3rds the size of this one, lies flatter in my pocket, and has the one blade I use daily: it's either what they're calling the cut and picker blade or the emergency blade, and I use it as a letter opener. The larger normal blade I use for opening cartons and heavier envelopes. This knife, which I bought 15 years ago at the Mall of America (well, I had to come home with SOME souvenir) is perfect. Sorry, folks, I can't find the name of it.I'll apologize for this review, but if you can find this knife in a store, then look for one without the pen, with a toothpick, about an eighth of an inch thinner, and you have my 5 star favorite. And while you're at it, but a pocket knife sharpener. (It looks like a pen, but it's a baby sharpener life you'd use at Thanksgiving.) It's similar to the Executive. Maybe it's a small Executive, but what kind of executive is peeling oranges in his or her office (the executive's extra blade that somebody in Switzerland must have thought was essential for army execs).All I can tell you is that they packed a whole lot of tools into this knife - some that I'll never use but you never know. After all, I use the scissors once or twice a week, and the tweezers have gotten thistle and splinters and lord-knows-what-else out of my fingers over the years.",4,"There's One Better Small Swiss Army Knife, But This is The Next Handiest",1285891200,"10 1, 2010",0.0246
3,A2HWZGVL5R7MSN,B00005ML8D,Jose A. Cruz ME,"[1, 1]",This knife is perfect for on your keychain carry. I went to a bbq this weekend and it was used multiple times for three different things. I had to pull it off my keychain because everyone needed a bottle opener for there beer. The scissors were used to open a capri sun that the straw was lost for a kid. And the knife was used to open a present. And when I told people it also has a pen they were shocked! awsome little knife just get it and put it on your keychain.,5,I cant leave home without it!,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",-0.0181
4,A28OFTZIF7MLXR,B00005ML8D,Longsion,"[0, 0]",The best small pocket knife I have ever seen.I can put this lovely thing in my pocket 7/24 no doubt.The screwdriver is small enough to use for computer I think unlike the Tinker has a much bigger one.

5,A1OKDIFW0HNYX5,B00005ML8D,Npcoach,"[1, 1]",Like most swiss army knives it is well made and very versatile. Every blade a normal person could possibly want and some you probably don't. All on a frame that fits easily on a key chain. The scissors are particularly useful. It is a great little knife to have around and it won't scare everyone in the office when you pull it out to open a package. Blades are sharp and the finish is typical Victorinox high quality.,5,The minichamp is a maxi hit.,1259452800,"11 29, 2009",0.3735

Lots of cool features in a mini-me size. While I have a true Swiss Champ, the thing would look stupid in a pair of dress pants at work. This thing is smaller than most car alarm key rings and very handy. Well worth the purchase.",5,Awesome,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",0.2801
7,A2RV56C21T320Y,B00005ML8D,Sam,"[0, 0]","This page is for the Swiss Army MiniChamp. When you buy, they put a Swiss Army MiniChamp II in your cart. I can not yet figure out what the difference is, but the close up images of the other Swiss Army II versions, Amazon exclusive models, indicate that the red handle material is matte finish rather than shiny red, probably a different material. Victorinox has an EcoLine series in the rest of the world that has different handles, made of Nylon so possibly that is what is happening here.Added:Digging a little more, it seems as though Victorinox calls this a MiniChamp II officially, with the usual shiny red scales we are used to. The original Model I had a toothpick instead of the pen and did not have the cap lifter Phillips tool.It would have been better if Amazon had chosen 2 or some other designation for their exclusive series. They look like great knives, but they are quite different if someone is expecting the red scales that have been on the Swiss Army for years.",5,Confusing Naming from Amazon,1392508800,"02 16, 2014",0.2805
