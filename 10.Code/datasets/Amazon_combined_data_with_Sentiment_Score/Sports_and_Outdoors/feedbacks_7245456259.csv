I noticed small rips on the band. This could have been the issue.",2,resistance was good but quality wasn't,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",0.2395

2,ACH40GDEWZRJS,7245456259,Dark Harden,"[0, 0]",I worked out once back in '08. I picked up some 40 lb weights and was like - &#34;too easy&#34;. So then I grabbed some resistance bands and almost broke them. Now I've been recommended Black Mountain products because they are very durable. I've had a set of the 25 lb red resistance bands for 3 months now and they look as good as when I first got them after an hour of use every day except Sunday.,5,I'm not opposed to this resistance!,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",0.1283
3,AHRQOLXJE4CBV,7245456259,JACK LOBO ljb926,"[0, 1]","I bought the purple one to add to my Strong Man Set of 6 to make it a Super Strong Man Set of 7. This is one tough band. Great for high intensity bicep curls and door anchor exercises, such as back rows and standing chest press. But too difficult for tricep kick backs. It came with a door anchor and an instruction pamphlet. There's no BMP logo on either handle just like their orange band. Overall I'm glad Black Mountain is going the direction of making their systems better and stronger. Keep up the good work.",5,I BOUGHT THE PURPLE ONE,1373673600,"07 13, 2013",0.2713

5,A27M3YPDI1YU5B,7245456259,R. Davis,"[0, 0]","Works just as advertised. Great, soft, but rugged spongy handles. Great tension. Seems well built. The locking device for the door works perfectly.",5,Great device.,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",0.3406
6,A1YYDO3HZHED58,7245456259,Ryan Nathaniel White,"[0, 0]","This band works well, and has lasted a long time despite heavy use 3x a week. The company was a joy to work with during communication over questions I had. Have already ordered another band in a lighter pull weight for my wife.",5,"Great product, even greater company.",1362787200,"03 9, 2013",0.2864
