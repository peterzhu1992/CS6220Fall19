0,A22K36X80X815R,B0000224UE,Abe Vigoda part-time inventor,"[26, 29]",One of the two best multi-tools on the market today. (the other being the Leatherman SuperTool 200)PROS:1) Strong pliers with comfortable grip2) All blades can open while pliers are closed and all blades lock3) Useful Chisel blade4) Anti-rust finish5) Heavy Duty steelCONS:1) The file on the X model seems to be made of aluminum. After some use the steel plating chipped off. The Leatherman file is much tougher and can be used on wood or metal.2) You might break your nails trying to open the blades.*UPDATE*>> I sold sold the X model and purchased the RS model thereby trading the cheap file for a curved serrated blade. I like this tool much better now.,5,An eye for detail,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",0.3889
1,ARSM6MA22IBYE,B0000224UE,C,"[0, 1]",I have owned a few swisstools and this was a bit of a disappointment. Half of the tools do not lock solidly in place with &#34;up and down&#34; play. The Sheath I received was defective. The button will not even close. I have written Victorinox to see if they will replace it. I assume they will.Just as reference they have changed the swisstool slightly this year. There is no red label on the tool anymore as shown in the picture. The full serrated blade is also a Sheepsfoot shape now and not as shown in the picture.This tool is still better in quality than most leathermans in my opinion. Leatherman is hit or miss on the Quality Control in my experience. This is the first Swisstool I have ever owned that I was even slightly disappointing with. Don't let the 3 stars fool you.,3,A bit disappointing,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",-0.1365

5,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B0000224UE,magellan,"[2, 2]","In my humble opinion, the best supertool around, and I own probably two dozen of them that I've collected over the years. The tool exhibits a fit and finish better than anything else out there, and one great feature is that the tools fold out from the outside of the handle. It featured a positive locking mechanism when most of the other tools still had yet to offer it, including the famous Leatherman. Even with all the innovative multitools of recent years with each new one trying to outdo the other, this took remains head and shoulders above the rest. Next to this, as with a previous reviewer, I would rate the Leatherman Supertool as best.",5,Great multitool,1194566400,"11 9, 2007",0.6261

I lasted three days bare of my Victorinox and couldn't go any longer. The price is a little spendy but trust me you won't even give it a second thought after you use this tool for a month. It is extremely well made, engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants. I don't go 24 hours that I don't use this tool at least a half dozen times. It has it all and then some. The steel in the blades is exquisite. The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp. I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw. Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime.",5,25 plus years and counting,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",0.1417
8,ADT66VQ9MIUWV,B0000224UE,Rudy,"[0, 0]","I bought this tool around 10 years ago to replace my Leatherman Wave. The wave was fine, but after four years of intermittent use the pliers began to loosen and while the blades on the outside began to feel very sticky. After trying to clean it multiple times with various solvents and re-oiling it never felt too good. I have also used a gerber multi-tool but I didn't like it near as much as my Wave.Once I replaced my Wave I felt the Victorinox was just a slightly more expensive tool, but it has proven to be much more. I have used it at least twice a week (many times much more often) for the past ten years and it still feels great. The tool closes and stays closed all the blades still lock and are easy enough to remove. The driver set still works great, though many of the bits have been replaced due to wear and tear. The nylon pouch is tearing and is almost ready to be replaced, but this is to be expected after ten years of wearing this tool on my belt. The only problem I have with this tool is that many of the tools are difficult to unfold due to their recessed fit, but this is negligible especially in most cases since this is the tool to use when you don't have access to real tools. It has saved me on many occasions when my bike breaks down away from home, or anything else that needs a quick tweak. This tool also comes with a lifetime warranty.If you are in the market for a multi-tool I cannot recommend this one enough. I also recommend buying one with the extra tools, these ones are easier to use in moments notice and the bits are easily replaced as they are worn out.",5,Best multi-tool I have ever bought.,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",0.1858
9,A3T2K0IHJ9S3YG,B0000224UE,ShotokanKid,"[2, 2]","I own several brands of multitools but Victorinox continues to top my list for its funtionality, smooth deployment, craftsmanship, and durability. Although Leatherman is a far second, I put my trust more in the Victorinox. I have one that Ive owned since 1983 and to this day, its main blade is sharp enough to slice paper floating down in air. Premium grade carbon stainless steel used in making Japanese swords! The wood saw in it also cuts through lead pipes. Put it this way, if I were lost in the thick jungles of South America, I would choose to have the SwissTool (rather than any Leatherman and Gerber) stuck to my belt. Maybe that's why MacGuyver favors Victorinox.",5,"Tough, heavy, hard",1168214400,"01 8, 2007",0.0357
10,A31PDR78F1MNDI,B0000224UE,Smaug Jeremy,"[1, 1]","Like many of you, I've been using Victorinox swiss army knives since I was a lad. My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2. It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about. (it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open, as they are so tight & with small opening slots)Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives. Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with:- #2 Phillips screwdriver: is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver: it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file: Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things, whether plastic or metal. The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty.",5,They've beat Leatherman at their own game!,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",0.2195

I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me, so I went with this model to get the serrated blade, and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned, buttery smooth, nicer than my Leatherman Rebar, and yes, bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside, and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool, I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler, inches/centimeters, is far easier to read than the Leatherman.
