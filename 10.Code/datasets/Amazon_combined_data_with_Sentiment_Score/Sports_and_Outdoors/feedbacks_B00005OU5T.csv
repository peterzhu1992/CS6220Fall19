I'm still not very proficient with this machine, but I'm hoping being on it more will help with that. I do like the non-jarring motion and I'm hoping for better results as I continue to build my time on the machine. Not as easy as Tony portrays it.",4,Good unit,1337904000,"05 25, 2012",0.2403

2,A37QUQPYFMR9Y9,B00005OU5T,M.D.C. Tempting Reviews,"[68, 77]","OK.So no doubt the title caught your eye and you're curious - what does he mean? I mean some of the reviews here are a little inaccurate, and I intend to respond to some of these comments. But first, let me give my personal thoughts on this machine.Background: I'm currently in the process of getting my body back into the shape it used to be in during high school. I have a Bowflex which does great for the strength training and muscle development, but regardless of what the commercials say, it's NOT designed to help you lose weight. So I decided to get the Gazelle Freestyle.First thing I noticed was that the parts are very sturdy and thick, definitely not as cheap as it looks in the pictures. They're hollow piping, so the whole deal is not too heavy; less than 60lbs. There also aren't that many parts to assemble, however I was not happy with the assembly process, for many reasons.First, the parts had some bolts pre-screwed into final holes which irritated me. It means you have to unscrew, find a place for them, then re-screw them after you connect the parts which, incidentally, might not happen until the end of the assembly. It's just an irritant; I'd rather just have the standard board of bolts and parts that comes with stuff today and let me attach it when it's good and ready.Second, the instructions aren't clear and the pictures are ambiguous. It makes it extremely difficult to know how things should be laid out - additionally, one of the steps is wrong. It shows a picture of the foot rests upside down, yet if you install it that way, it'll be wrong.Third is a symptom of the second one above. The steps in the instructions tell you to do things the wrong way - literally, assemble it in the wrong direction. If you do it in reverse, the assembly will go a LOT quicker and you'll realize that it's actually nowhere near as complex as it's made out to be. It's quite simple, really consisting of three steps instead of the 7-8 that the instructions have you believe.Ok, so now that the bad news is out of the way, onto the actual experience (and my responses to the other reviews).Squeaks: Haven't noticed any. It makes a tiny noise as moving parts will, but it's nothing deal breaking. If you get some regular grease and add a bit to the axle bar, you won't even notice it. It does come pre-greased, but again, if the squeaking bothers you so much....Ineffective: Uh, what? I'm in decent shape and I was able to get a decent workout from this thing. I think some of these guys had super-high expectations based on Tony Little jumping around like an idiot. You're not going to start sweating on this thing after a minute of moving, even if you do it rapidly. There's a reason for this, and it's a good reason if you think about it: merely moving doesn't cause you to sweat. Impact causes you to sweat, even if you don't actually come in contact with something. That's why if you were shadow boxing, you'll get a good workout, because you're actually making impacts with the air, sharp hits that actually exert your muscles. This machine doesn't actually exert your muscles beyond normal range of motion, which is why it shouldn't be used for any strength or endurance training. It will, however, give you a good cardio workout after a time. NOT A MINUTE. That said, I did the workout all through a 10-minute WWE match, and by the end of it I was at the beginning stages of sweating, and started to feel a little fatigue; comparable to what you would feel after having walked rapidly for two miles, but with less muscle exertion. I took a break, and got the feeling in my legs where it seemed as though I was still going through the motion.Heart Monitor: I think this device is not useful. I'm serious. I mean if I were actually running or walking then I would pay attention, but as I mentioned before, there is no true exertion on this device which would really push your heart muscle. To me, a heart monitor is more useful on a treadmill or even an elliptical, not on this. If you use it, great...I didn't even bother installing it, therefore I can't review it.So, do I recommend it? Yes...as long as you don't have any misconceptions about performance. It's not going to cause you to start sweating after a minute of use. You really need to work it for at least 10 minutes, consistently, changing speed and angle. If you lean forward, you add some resistance and will feel it.",4,A review that answers other reviews.,1211328000,"05 21, 2008",-0.0324
3,A1BJOHHLG0D965,B00005OU5T,M.D. Edwards Avid Aesthete,"[58, 62]","I actually ordered mine from JC Penney, since I got a GREAT price on it by way of an advertising error on their part... Either way, I only got it last night, and didn't find it too difficult to assemble just going by the sheet instructions. It IS quite heavy weight in construction, which I definitely count as a plus.The one thing that I can see that, so far, hasn't been mentioned in the reviews is, if you're on the heavier side (I'm 210 lbs at 5'5 tall, the heaviest I've EVER been - ick!!!), and wide through the hips, it doesn't SEEM particularly roomy when you're on the machine. I DID have a great time exercising on it last night after assembling it, though!If you love elliptical machines, as I do (they were my only motivation for going to the gym, and every time I went, I had to wait at least 20 minutes to get on one, so I cancelled my membership... Now I've got my own, dagnabbit! ;) ), you should really like this machine.I don't know if they're as squeaky over time as the other reviews state, but I'd assume that they are. Also, I live in a single bedroom apartment, and don't have a lot of room left over to leave this standing up. The main problem? I'd planned on sliding it under my futon when I'm not using it, but everything but the handles will fit - the handles just sit too high up to fit underneath it. It IS a heavy piece, as I said before, so a bit unwieldy, but the wheels on both the bottom of the rear frame, and the foot pedal pieces, help for maneuvering it.If you're not big on exercise, as I am not unless it's fun for me, but love cross trainer and elliptical machines, then I'd suggest you get this, if it's not more money than you want to spend. It does take a little initial exercise to figure out your rhythm, but once you get going, it's GREAT! I woke up this morning eager to get back on it and go, and I haven't felt that way about exercise in YEARS, if ever!",5,It's GREAT! Just make sure you've researched it enough to know what to expect!,1146873600,"05 6, 2006",0.3541
4,A5Q1FK0FWU7DH,B00005OU5T,TC,"[2, 5]","I was lucky enough to use this over a period of a few weeks while at my mother's house. It does not provide an aerobic workout compared to a treadmill or an elliptical. There is very little resistance. It is squeeky. The movements are jerky compared to an elliptical. It take sup a lot of space. I found no value to it since it didn't get my heart rate up, it wasn't working any muscles, and it didn't provide a core work out. Not sure what the purpose would be. I am not a very aerobically fit person and can easily work up a sweat on other equipment within a few minutes so not getting an aerobic workout here really says a lot. So, I don't even think that this is a good machine for beginners.On the positive side, all of the grandchildren love to swing on it and play on it. (that probably isn't a positive for my mother though). The kids think it is fun.",2,Not worth any amount of money or space,1244332800,"06 7, 2009",0.1285
