1,A21Q9HY3XGJIU3,B00004WFUQ,Chess,"[0, 0]",Versatile and steady enough. I don't like the rubbber grommets used as feet but that's a minor complaint. A simple design that gets the job done.,4,Good way to hold stones of different lengths.,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",-0.1732
2,A2I68CD3VP1VW7,B00004WFUQ,John Judd,"[0, 0]",I first purchased two Diamond whetstones and they worked great. However the whetstone didn't always just sit there and not move during sharpening -- I purchased this whetstone base to hold my whetstone and allow me to use both hands to hold a large kitchen knife while sharping. It is so much easier now using this whetstone base.,5,Makes sharping a knide easy,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",0.4857
3,A2TAY3SZ3TF5EI,B00004WFUQ,OphirDude,"[1, 1]","This is a no-brainer. If you purchase the bench stone, you absolutely need the base, otherwise I am not sure how you would even use the stone.",5,"If you get a DuoSharp bench stone, this is a must have",1358812800,"01 22, 2013",-0.1206
4,A2JSJ996SB0D0V,B00004WFUQ,Randy,"[1, 1]","does what it says and nothing to shout about. Can fit 10-in and 8-in places, and 6-in DMT whetstones too.",5,Okay,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.1806
5,A1TAHDMKLZJNX4,B00004WFUQ,Skeptical purchaser,"[2, 3]","I live in an apartment and after attempting to sharpen some knives using other means with the DMT sharpening stones, I decided for safety reasons I needed to get a base. The base itself comes with rubber stoppers you have to install both at the base and where larger stones would sit. It is elevated comfortably enough above the surface it sits on that sharpening has become significantly easier. It does slide a little however on a kitchen counter top. I added some weight to the sides to help hold it down and that seemed to help it sit still better. I kind of wish the base itself was heavier so that I would need to do this every time but it still allows me a much better surface to sharpen my knives.",4,Could use a litle more traction. does what is expected,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",0.4647

7,A5YBZQ14BWDCR,B00004WFUQ,TruGospel,"[0, 0]",I love this base! I use it with my new DMT sharpening stones and it provides a very sturdy and usable base for those stones. Makes sharpening a LOT easier. Easy to set up and easy to use. I'm satisfied. :-),5,Works great!,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",0.4219
8,A2NM9HSGVNYEM8,B00004WFUQ,TX Coach,"[0, 0]",The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is because it's made of plastic and call me old fashion but it just doesn't feel very substantial when I'm using it. Now other than that this little bad boy is dang near perfect and really helps sharpen knives.,4,Works perfectly with my DMT 10 Duo Sharp Stones,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",0.1128
