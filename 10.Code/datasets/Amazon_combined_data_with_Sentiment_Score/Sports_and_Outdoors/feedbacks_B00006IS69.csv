I have both the Fieldmaster and the Huntsman, and the only difference is the phillips screwdriver vs the corkscrew. You cannot go wrong with a true Swiss Army knife as long as you pick a model that suits your needs.TIPS:-There's a tiny hole under the phillips opening to add your own straight pin.-The hook is useful for pulling tent loops and stakes, hooking things through loops.-Reamer is great for punching belt loops, creating holes, getting out shoelace knots.-Be very careful with the saw - it is the sharpest tool I've ever seen! Useful for cutting twigs for marshmellow/hotdog cooking sticks, cutting cardboard.Highly recommended!",5,Perfect!,1336262400,"05 6, 2012",0.4166

3,A1IVILJ61HWM5O,B00006IS69,chris,"[2, 2]","I think its a great pocket knife. I never really gave Victorinox a chance until recently but I end up using this knife a lot more than a folder for obvious reasons. The steel is fine for my needs and really sharpens up fast and easy even if you never sharpened a blade before you wouldn't have much trouble with the flat ground blade on this knife. So even if you suck at it you can get this fairly sharp with poor skill. I have sharpened for a long time and I can get this knife hair shaving sharp in literally 3 minutes compared to some of my knives which could take a whole hour+ if I neglect and fail to hone and maintain the edge properly. I don't whittle so i cant say it would be good for that I have read a few people using it but that's not my hobby if I did though I would probably use a carbon steel anyway. I do cut some sticks to size for marshmallows, Open packages, open mail, I have cut my nails a couple times to with it, Tighten loose screws if their easy to get to and not to critical I they are i will go get a real screw driver to really tighten that gut down. I do use the can opener a lot though. I prefer a leather-man style can opener compared to this. When I use the Swiss can opener I have to work a tad bit harder for the few final cuts but it does work fine. I Have used the awl to punch holes in cans and I recently sharpened the big flat head screw driver to be a chisel not just a screwdriver. Have yet to use the Parcel Hook....The scissors are great they are so smooth and feel nice they cut very well I was actually surprise how good they work. The blades are sharp I haven't used the Small one though. The steel is fine for me i strop it on my jeans a lot though, but I do that to all my blades out of habit. I have yet to sharpen the thing really I hit it on a ceramic about 8 times on each side but that's about it and that was when I first received it. The saw is cool works great for the size of the thing. I randomly end up in the woods when I hang out with my cousin he likes to off road so its nice to have. I suspect this to last me a really long time and if I do lose it I will buy another. I don't mind that it's not a locking blade I have yet to cut myself I have learned to use a knife properly and if I need to abuse a blade I would use a full tang one. I don't try and abuse my blades though and I don't need to thrust it into someones tire or skull a piece of steel or wall. So there is very little reasons or scenarios where I needed something with a locking blade, though there has been a couple times. If I need a locking blade ill wait or figure something else out there really is no need to ever force anything with a bladed object.This is a great pocket knife its not big at all if your used to carrying a folder give this a try. Though it wont replace a big folders self defense ability's it will enhance all your others. The great thing about it is its normally publicly acceptable almost every where. No one gives you weird looks like when you pull out a 3,4,5 inch folder out of your pocket to open or cut something. I would recommend a Swiss army knife and I have. I plan on buying another.",5,I have used this for a few months now in my EDC,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",0.0828

9,A2KOJWXB9WT3HC,B00006IS69,JaketheSnake,"[2, 2]","This SAK is one of the best on the market. I've used mine damn near everyday for the last 7 years and couldn't be happier with it. The ONLY downside to this knife is that it doesn't come with a file/metal saw like on the Ranger, but then again the Ranger comes with a corkscrew which I haven't ever had a need for. The handles have come off over the years, but I actually prefer it without, as it aids in grip with the three large rivets on the sides. It may seem a little big and awkward at first but trust me, after a few weeks of carrying this you won't even notice it's there until you need it (like any good pocket knife). Ok now on to the individual tools. Both the main blade and secondary blade are, or can be made, extremely sharp. I've actually shaved my face with the main blade before an inspection once, and passed :) The steel is excellent for a knife of this size and doesn't require constant resharpening (minor touchups will be needed to keep it razor sharp though). The saw is good at what it does for bone, wood, and plastic, making deep, aggressive cuts. The scissors are ok for smaller jobs like fingernails, bangs, or the tips of super glue and the like. The bottle opener/screwdriver does as advertised, tightens or loosens larger screws and opens bottles big and small. The can opener/wire stripper/small screwdriver is probably one of the most used tools on here for me, as I have a tendency to break this out instead of using an electric can opener most of the time. The Phillips screwdriver is a godsend in a SAK, but I wish it would lock in place as I've pinched many a finger really torqueing down on a screw. The parcel hook is almost useless, just omit it and give me the chisel please! And last but not least, the reamer has MANY other functions (imagination is key here) than as just a reamer. To be honest, I would gladly have paid twice the amount for this indespensible tool. Buy one, you'll like it. Use one, you'll love it.",5,Great EDC carry,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",0.2762

16,A3GKPSP3ZMGUFU,B00006IS69,Scout,"[2, 2]","I've had this exact knife (ok, I think the hook is new) for 30 years now -- and it's still my goto pocketknife. In my opinion, this is the perfect mix of pocketknife tools. I've used each of them many many times, on backpacking trips, around the house, car, everywhere. I had this long before leathermen became popular, and frankly, I never remember a time I wanted pliers while camping, so I'd still pack this first today. Victorinox blades are outstanding, razor sharp and hard to dull. The saw can cut any branch up to 2 thick easily. The scissors are essential for a million things, and like the knives super sharp. The can opener can really open any can you need, albeit slowly. Of course, the bottle opener and screw drivers work well (not so hard with those, eh?) The tweezers are essential for splinters. The toothpick is perfect when you need it (and I've actually never broken even a toothpick with all the many ones I own). The awl/knife is odd, never think you need one, but somehow keep using it. Long ago the classic swiss army pocket knife was this except with a corkscrew v. a phillips head... we'd go pretty far outta our way to find this one instead, because no one carried too many wine bottles while backpacking. Now I've got the corkscrew one as well for city life. These days they have plenty of larger knives, but I'm not sold on carrying one more thing than is on this knife.

Be careful, as it will make quick work of your fingers; it is very sharp and cuts aggressively. It is also good that the can opener and bottle opener are separate tools. The Victorinox can opener works wonderfully. Also, the can opener has a handy little screwdriver tip which can be used as a Philips screwdriver sometimes. The reamer is a lot more handy than you would think, though not as a reamer. I use it to change watch bands, as the sharp tip reaches in and releases the spring bars without too much fuss. The most used tool for me though is the large screwdriver tip on the bottle opener. The one disadvantage with this one is that it is starting to get a bit thick to carry in your pocket. A belt sheath would be more appropriate, if you can pull that off without feeling too geeky. (Personally, I don't care, hehehe)",5,The best mix of tools,1057017600,"07 1, 2003",0.0999
