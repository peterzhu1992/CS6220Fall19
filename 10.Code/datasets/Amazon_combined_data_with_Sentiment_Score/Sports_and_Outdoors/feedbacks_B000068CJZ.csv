I bought these that are identical to the old one because I like the scan feature, the large numbers in the panel and the small size. It works well. If I can say something back is that the mounting only allows a handle bar position and it does not sit very tight on the base. My handle bar is not very large and even being small it takes space there. I also have my headlights in there and of course those have to be a the front. Sometimes, it will stop measuring if you touch it forward. It will not come off since there is a plastic stopper at the end but it will move out of the sensors and stop reading your ride.

I usually ride only two different routes that cannot be verified by driving my car over the same route. ( dedicated bike trails ). It is really not a bad unit for the price. I don't need something that will last for years. Once I know the distance of the routes I could just un-install it if I wanted to.. Ordered on a Wedesday A.M. and it arrived on Thurdsay P.M..It took about 10 minutes to install and off I went. Tested on a route @ Lake Perris Ca. and I was riding 12 miles( assumed it was 10 ) .

Just read the directions and you shouldn't have any problems. The only thing I would recommend is measuring your tire yourself, rather than using the chart provided in the manual.Using the chart will get you in the ballpark, and for rides to the store and back it may be all you need.

8,AY92D346R4880,B000068CJZ,DeeMee,"[1, 1]","For so little money, hard to go wrong unless the product is defective. It wasn't, worked as advertised and quite accurately. Simple to install. Fairly easy to use.Has a decel/accel (speed tendency) feature which isn't too good. Has a little picture of a cyclist and wheels on it spin forward or backward to show when you are acclerating or decellerating. But it is too small, and hard to see which way the wheels are spinning. Much better would have been an easy to see arrow pointing forward or rearward. Then again, I don't find much use for this, as you normally feel in the pedals if you are speeding up or slowing down.The plus or minus sign next to speed to show whether you are above or below your current average speed is sometimes nice to have. Other than that, it has speed, average speed, max speed, and a totalizing odometer plus a scan mode which switches every four seconds. I found it accurate especially after bothering to measure the distance in millimeters of one loaded wheel rotation. Simple to input into the device once you have done the measurement. The built in clock function is nice also.The unit only counts time on the timer when you are moving. This is nice as it doesn't interfere with getting an average speed or riding time should you stop for a few moments. Unit also switches off when wheel isn't moving to save the battery.I find it seems to do some time averaging of the speed readout which takes 3 seconds to fully even out. Don't know if others similar products work that way, but really this doesn't interfere with the use of the product and is only the result of having a sensor that pulses once per wheel revolution. It also doesn't read below about 2.4 mph which of course is slow enough you are barely able to stay upright anyway.I also noticed it sometimes double counts every few revolutions. The distance will jump two thousands of a mile rather than one. Maybe a rounding error or some such in the electronics. I have counted rev's of the wheel over a known distance and it isn't counting twice the overal distance shown is accurate. So probably a non-problem unless you compulsively watch the distance readout while riding.I haven't owned one of these before having only used simple mechanical speedo's and odometers in the past. But this works great and is a handier more useful device. Unless you need cadence or detailed pacing not sure what else you would want this device to do. Cheap enough to replace if damaged, or buy multiples if you have several bikes. Would rate it 4 and 1/2 stars. Just not quite perfect or it would get 5 stars.",4,"Inexpensive, but works just fine...",1277164800,"06 22, 2010",-0.0205

The unit I have has a mostly red face [the case color], otherwise, everything else is as described.I chose this Schwinn 12-function computer over the Cateye Velo 5-function computer [the only other option at the military store] mostly because of the display size...the Schwinn's is larger, and much more readable for most functions. I use reading glasses, and was concerned about being able to read the small Cateye display. As it turns out, it's difficult to interpret the Speed Tendency function while cycling [it uses a small bicycle in the top left corner of the display...its tiny wheels turn forward to show accelerations, and backward to show deceleration]. All other info is easy to read & interpret.You need to set in wheel circumference...there is a table provided, which includes the standard wheel sizes. If you make an error, you can remove the battery to zero out the info, and start again.The components seem to be sturdy enough...the handlebar mounting bracket looks to be slightly redesigned [it is different from the operating manual illustrations]. The bracket's computer retention clip is still a bit puny. The unit comes with thin white zip ties; they are difficult to cinch up tightly, so I recommend you use your own.I'll comment again later if I have problems with longevity.

Unfortunately on this one the latch that holds the head unit to the handlebar mount is very weak and the unit will come off all too easily. Sometimes it works loose while riding.

17,A3CJ7EHUS0G8IH,B000068CJZ,Maryland Customer,"[0, 0]","I won't describe the product in detail, discuss instructions, etc. as that has been covered extensively by other reviewers.PROS: (1) Low price. (2) Has the all basic functions needed by a beginner to intermediate biker to track their progress / measure their improvement. (3) Reliable and consistent (at first) as long as the cyclometer is properly set up for you bike and is firmly seated into the mount.CONS: (1) Poor build quality and plastics, especially the mount, which means this cyclometer's measurements will become unreliable in the long run. (2) The mount is only suitable for the handlebar; if you want to attach the cyclometer to the stem, you have to look elsewhere (or make modifications to the mount).DETAIL: I've purchased 4 of these and/or their Bell twins, both wired and wireless models, and installed them on 4 bikes. After going thru cold winter riding season followed by hot summer rides (e.g, about a year), ALL of them started getting loose in the mount, causing unreliable readings as the cyclometer would lose then regain contact to the mount as the bicycle hit bumps in the road. Identical rides would be measured at 26.7 miles one day, 18.4 miles the next and 21.8 miles the third. Average speeds would vary by 3-4 mph from day to day, when my watch showed that I was covering a fixed course at in the same amount of time. VERY frustrating.QUICK FIX: If you choose to buy this cyclometer and eventually start to experience reliability problems, try using a thin rubber band to hold the cyclometer firmly to the mount. After I did that the readings became reliable / consistent again and the cyclometer has yet to fall out of the mount, no matter how hard a bump I've hit.Safe biking!",3,Reasonable value for price despite cheap plastic & poor build quality,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",-0.1181

Make sure nothing jerks on the cords coming out of the computer base. That happened to me, and I'm stingy enough I re-soldered the (shortened) wires, and it still works reliably, but it was a PITA. The magnet has a tab on it that looks like it's made for bladed spokes. It works for that, but it also works to pinch 2 spokes together where they cross, so the magnet does not rotate. If you can angle the sensor forward of the fork blade, close enough to read there, it works reliably in that position and the magnet stays put even better. (small spokes let it rotate sometimes if just put on 1 spoke.)I have a half dozen of these on different bikes, and found some small Chinese Neodymium magnet discs (look like button batteries) that fit in the magnet holders.

Keeping that in mind, here are the negatives:1. The attaching mechanism on the mount is a flimsy, rubber strap with eyelets that hook around a nub. Other reviews have stated that bumps will cause it to pop off. While it hasn't happened to me (yet), it certainly seems plausible.2. Because of the cheap design of the mount, it can only be oriented (mounted) one way. At most, you can angle the speedometer a little one way or the other, but can't rotate it a complete 90. IOW, if you want to attach it to the handlebar stem to save space on your handlebars for something else, you're SOL. This is not the case with other, better bike speedometers.3. The speedometer doesn't inspire confidence when inserting it into the mount (it doesn't feel very secure). Other reviews have stated the speedometer comes loose and does not make proper contact with the mount and, again, it sure seems like it could happen.4. The wheel spoke magnet has four little plastic 'tangs' that hold the magent into that mount. The problem is the tangs can actually make contact with the sensor. I was hearing a faint 'clicking' noise and discovered it was one of the tangs cutting a nice groove into the sensor. Fortunately, I was able to move the magnet away from the sensor and it still works, but who knows for how long?5. The speedometer's buttons feel downright cheap, like a plastic toy.The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it has the biggest numeral display for speed of any of the cheap speedometers. But that aside, save your money and invest in a slightly more expensive, better speedometer like Cateye or Sigma that are carried by an LBS, big-box sports store (like Dicks), or online.",2,"Toy, Nothing More",1343520000,"07 29, 2012",0.1501

It's featherweight, easy to read, auto on/off (really important) and has a nice scan feature where it will cycle through the various functions continuously. I just generally leave it on speed/odo since my average speed usually reminds me how inadequate I am as a cyclist.About setting wheel size. For those that are absolutely anal about accuracy, borrow someone's GPS and use it to calibrate the wheel size setting.

If you're satisfied with a simple, cheap speedometer and only occasionally use the other functions, this is the one.Here are some hints that fairly eliminate most of the small complaints.1. Install the magnet close to the wheel's hub and adjust it (twist the sensor in) so that the magnet passes as close as possible without touching.2. Remove the computer when the bike is not in use. It has a quick release; store it inside or in your pocket and the battery will last.3. Leaving it outside in direct sunlight may cause a dark splotch on the screen.

Read the manual to learn how to reset it (which buttons to hold down), and to calibrate it for your wheel size.The only issues I've had: the buttons will eventually get some play if you use them a lot and become contrary, and I need to be careful to secure it firmly in the quick release mount (so that it doesn't fall out when I hit a bump).",5,Best Value bicycle speedometer.,1247529600,"07 14, 2009",0.1545
