0,A60O9YC0Z10O2,B00004SQM7,970,"[1, 1]","This must be more ideal for a handgun. The locking bar did not fit behind the trigger on my AR-15, Remington 12 gauge, nor my Reuger .22. The instructions state that the bar does not have to go behind the trigger, however, when I tried that, I could still manage to pull the whole thing and activate the trigger on the AR and shotgun. The .22 was the only gun I had that this would absolutely stop the trigger from being moved. I should have returned it, but I was lazy.",2,Didn't Fit,1307404800,"06 7, 2011",-0.1611

To big to fit on my glock .23 as it is a smaller gun to begin with, so i just use the cable lock it came with. Other than that i could see this as an excellent lock, but it's picky with the guns it fits.",3,has potential,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.1112

3,ANXE2VV6AQ0GU,B00004SQM7,Chris,"[0, 0]","I wanted a trigger lock for my new Ruger GP-100 revolver. The one that Ruger supplies you with is a large padlock that fits through the cylinder, but you can't close a normal handgun case lid while it's on the revolver. Here in CA, strict gun laws prohibit us to drive with an unlocked firearm. Ruger provides a cheap, hard plastic, form-fitting case with the revolver. As I left the gun shop, there was no way I was going to be able to put this padlock on and keep it in it's case. I figured a trigger lock would be much more suitable for the gun as well as the longevity of the cylinder (not to mention a foam form-fitting case being a must-have). I don't want the off chance of something like the cylinder getting bent during transport. I prefer not to have the lid of any case pushed up against it.When reading other users reviews, I found very few people talking about what guns it did/didn't work on for them. C'mon people! Help some of us out! I looked all over for anyone even saying it worked on a revolver in general. I'm not 100% pleased with the lock, but I'll manage to make it work. I'm here to say that it fits OK on a Ruger GP-100, but it definitely doesn't fit on a Beretta PX4 Storm. On the GP-100, you have to have it at about a 35 degree angle, which the instructions say that's alright, but I'd rather it be at a horizontal position. The grip of the revolver is in the way, but like I said, you can angle it and make it fit. It's still tight and you can't wiggle it around. I have yet to try it on my shotgun, although I prefer my cable lock on something like that.All in all, it'll work for transporting my firearm to the range. Nothing more. It's not a lock to keep a thief away. It's simply so I can abide by the law and be legal about transporting my firearm. That's about all it's good for. If you're worried about child safety - get a safe.",3,Ruger GP-100 & Beretta PX4 Storm usage...,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",0.0896

6,A370ZOS3HOG1JH,B00004SQM7,Nick,"[0, 0]","I've had one of these in use for nearly a dozen years and it is a solidly constructed, reliable locking device for use on the trigger guard of even a very large frame revolver. I always recommend putting firearms in a safe or locked gun cabinet (secured to a wall, floor, or both), but these kind of trigger locks added to unloaded firearms are an excellent backup, and keep unauthorized fingers away from triggers.Rim-fire guns, and a lot of vintage center-fire guns are best never dry-fired. Using a trigger lock can help prevent accidental damage by people who just don't know better. Of all of the different types of trigger and action locks I've employed, this one is the most ruggedly constructed and durable model I've owned.",4,As Good As This Sort of Lock Gets,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",0.1157

When this thing is on you're gonna have a pretty tough time getting it off if you don't have a key.One thing I'll note though (and this is not related to this product) but a design flaw with these is that if you attach one you're not 100% in the clear as it literally takes 1 minute to unscrew the trigger guard from most guns re-exposing the trigger. This is definitely the case for my Remington 700 as anyone who actually wants to shoot the gun but doesn't have the key can just unscrew the hinged floor plate assembly and reattach a new one without this thing on it. That's why I also got one of those long locks that goes through the action.",5,This thing is great.,1388880000,"01 5, 2014",0.3246
