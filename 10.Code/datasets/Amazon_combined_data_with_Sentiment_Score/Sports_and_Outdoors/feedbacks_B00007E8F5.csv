0,ATFGV6REZKO16,B00007E8F5,Bill Harrell,"[0, 0]",Carry this little guy everyday. Used mostly for cutting up fruit for my lunches. Gets the job done very well. Easy to sharpen and easy to clean. Small size is barely noticed in my pocket. Very happy with this little guy.,5,Excellent small pen knife.,1396310400,"04 1, 2014",0.2732
1,AHA4XNFLSG7JH,B00007E8F5,D. Schwemin,"[0, 0]","Very simple yet elegant design. If your looking for a great simple EDC option that will not take up much room in your pocket and won't weigh you down, then this is a great option. It has 1 full sized plain edge blade, and 1 smaller plain edge pen knife.Something to note is that this knife does NOT come with tweezers or toothpick. Nor does it have a key ring attachment. This knife is more or less something that you could carry when wearing a nice suit. It's very streamlined and slim.",5,Great EDC,1393632000,"03 1, 2014",0.3478

3,A3JFNZQMLYAMH,B00007E8F5,Jim Millman,"[0, 0]",Great pocket knife. I find it useful to have a pocket knife around for many reasons. The most important is to open things that have packing tape that is almost bullet proof otherwise...,5,Great knife...,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",0.4456
4,A1XFQ1J63O7SPZ,B00007E8F5,Leonard Mihai leonet,"[0, 0]","I bought this pocket knife for my daughter and is just what we wanted.It is good looking (glossy red plastic handle covers with golden logo) and functional and we like the fact that it has two blades so you can use one for the rough work and save the other to have a nice sharp edge when you need it.The blades are a bit hard to pull out (maybe they will break in with time) but once they are out they swing and click very firmly in the open position; there is no play from side to side or nay other kind. I guess it is hard to ask for a firm blade lock and have an easy pull out as well. Anyway, if you have good nails that shouldn't be a big problem.The long blade has a decent size for most jobs that will be used for, and so far I haven't seen any scratches from the other stuff she caries in her purse.Overall we (especially my daughter) like it a lot and we recommend it.",5,Elegant and useful,1346716800,"09 4, 2012",0.7258
5,AP0UBYBQQOW1S,B00007E8F5,Ranger Blade,"[3, 3]",This Knife was a great buy. I use it for small tasks and whittling. It arrived fast. It was sharp and great quality. As always Victorinox has made an excellent pocket knife.,5,Great Knife!,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",0.3643
6,A2V99RXY8L0HL7,B00007E8F5,Ricardo,"[4, 8]","I just received two of these knives and am extremely disappointed.Sitting here on my desk are the two new knives and another Victorinox SAK that I've owned for at least 25 years. I find it hard to believe that these were both made in Switzerland by the same company.Looking at the older knife (which has seen a lot of use) the liner edges (liners are the metal pieces that fit inside the scales on either side of the blades) are flawless, except for a few scratches that I've put on them.Looking at the new knives, both show poorly finished edges on the liners. Frankly, I've seen five dollar knives from China finished better than these. My old SAK shows finishing comparable to Case. I work for a Swiss-owned company and am very familiar with the Swiss obsession for perfection and Victorinox should be ashamed.Frankly, if it wasn't that the rest of the knives look fine, I'd be wondering if these were the real thing. One of the knives was intended as a gift, but I'd be embarrassed to present it to anyone.In addition to giving the dealer (who I have contacted) the benefit of the doubt, I'm giving these knives only one star based on the poor finishing.Edited: The dealer has agreed to replace both knives. Based upon the condition of the replacements, I may be changing this review accordingly.Edited 10-4-11. The dealer did replace both knives and even sent me the replacements before I returned the originals. Hard to beat that kind of service. I had not mentioned the name of the dealer originally as I wanted to give them a chance to make things right, and they did. The dealer was Swiss Knife Shop and their service is as good as it gets.However, I still don't think that Victorinox products are as good as they used to be. The replacement knives were a lot better than the originals, but still don't compare to my older SAKs. Maybe I'm being overly harsh as, after all, this is a $15 knife and I've gotten used to more expensive products. I've upgraded the review to three stars based on the better examples of the product, but I'd give the dealer 5 stars if that were possible.",3,"Shame on Victorinox, Bravo for Swiss Knife Shop",1317254400,"09 29, 2011",0.2104
7,A1705TNO718MCG,B00007E8F5,tjclay95,"[0, 1]",I have always liked Swiss Knifes. They make great products! The knife last a long time. You can tell that the knife is made from good material. The blade stays sharp after many years of repeated use.This little pocket knife was exactly what I was looking for. I recommend this to everyone looking for a pocket knife.,5,Great Pocket Knife,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",0.3137
8,A2WAEGYGAIUNVZ,B00007E8F5,WDS,"[0, 1]","Personally I like the thinner, think it's aluminium sided knife that's the same model. Couple buck more but worth it. It was though shipped quickly and well packed.",4,lil red pocket knife.,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",0.3499
