I bought my gf a pair as well and she uses them several times a week with no complaints.

They fit great, and they don't leak much at all. I exert myself pretty hard when I swim (i.e., I am out of shape), and they don't seem to fog up very badly. Every now and then I need to de-fog them, but mostly they're great. They stay in place, they don't leak, and they're adjustable. I particularly like that adjusting them is not particularly easy to do -- yes, I like that it's hard to adjust the length, because that makes the length very stable and secure.

They work up to the Speedo name! A few things to watch out for with these though. The eye pieces are close together so if you have a bigger nose they probably won't fit right. They do not leak at all. But you will get some racoon eyes. I swim 30 -45 minutes a day and these things will leave racoon eyes. But you have to take the good with the bad.
