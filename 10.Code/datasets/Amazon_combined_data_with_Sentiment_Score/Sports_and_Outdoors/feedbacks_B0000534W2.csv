0,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B0000534W2,Beth Cholette doctor_beth,"[45, 45]","I purchased this ball in the 55 cm size (red). This size seems ideal for my height (just shy of 5'5), although choice of ball size is also a matter of personal preference. Unlike my previous ball, which was made of a thin, sticky vinyl, this ball is made of thick durable, smooth plastic. Furthermore, my previous ball lost air easily (I had to add air to it every time I used it), whereas I have NEVER had to add air to this ball since I purchased it almost two years ago. It is definitely worth the investment to pay a little more for a ball that is high quality and will never any maintenance, and so I highly recommend this product.",5,Excellent quality stability ball!,1197590400,"12 14, 2007",0.2253
1,A2SV00MJEE8UHG,B0000534W2,Brian Nussbaum,"[0, 0]","I've used Thera-Band balls at the place where I got physical therapy and I know they are great quality. The issue I had was that the ball I received did not come with an adapter that would allow me to inflate it with a bicycle pump, nor did it come with a plug. So basically it was unusable, as you can't inflate it without a plug to stop the air from exiting once it's inflated. Also, if you don't get an adapter for a bicycle pump, you will need some sort of pump that can fit into the hole of this ball to inflate it.As much as I love the brand, I would recommend a different ball that comes as a kit with a hand pump, plug, etc. I ended up getting a GAIAM ball and have been very pleased.",1,Make sure you order one that guarantees it comes with a plug,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",0.3912

When pumping it up, if it's too small, just keep pumping, don't be afraid...it will get to the size it is meant to be.",5,I like balls...,1344729600,"08 12, 2012",0.2131

6,A1VC67V35UEYNJ,B0000534W2,S. Rose,"[4, 4]","I bought this item to help me with a new exercise plan. My personal trainer recommended I get one and had suggested I just to a local discount store and pick one up. However, a friend of mine had bought a ball that way for her son. She told me about a month later that the ball had leaked and her son didn't want to fix it, so it was tossed out.I have two cats and one of my fears with an item like this is thier front claws and curiosity. So, I decided to get a ball that was puncture resistant.This exercise ball was far superior to the one my friend had bought. This one feels very strong. My cats couldn't puncture it I don't think even if they tried. It does not loose air. (My friend also had to add more air at least once a week to the cheap ball she bought.)I hate the color orange and the picture showed that the 55 inch ball was red so I figured I was fine. Nope. It is bright orange. That is my only complaint.",5,"The 55 inch ball is orange not red, my only complaint",1206921600,"03 31, 2008",0.1876
