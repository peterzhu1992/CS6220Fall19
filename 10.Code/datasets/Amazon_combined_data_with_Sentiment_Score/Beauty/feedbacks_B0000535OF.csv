I use it at night before I go to bed and when I go to apply my makeup in the morning after my shower you can really see how even this stuff has made my skin appear. I'm 34 with no wrinkles and a few fine lines and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing! fast absorbent, no smell - great results!",5,skin glows!,1322697600,"12 1, 2011",0.3124

The Vitimin E it claims to have is 18th on the list.. my bad for not reading this first. Mineral oil is basically a petro oil, which is something that can make your car run in certain forms.
