There is nothing incredibly special about it. But it is a decent curling iron. It is available in three barrel sized, 1/2&#34;, 3/4&#34; (which is what I bought, and 1&#34;.This is the traditional design, with a heating barrel and piece that opens and &#34;clamps&#34; against the barrel with a thumb lever. Our family prefers this to the newer heating wands that have no clamp and come with a heat-resistant glove. We find those tend to be awkward, as you need two hands to manipulate the iron and your hair, as opposed to this design where you have one hand free for a brush, but still can use the clamp to curl your hair.The iron features a black tip at the end of the chrome barrel. The tip does not get very hot at all.Heating is very quick, about a minute, and it has a simple rotary knob built into the handle to adjust the heat. The controls are near where some people may hold the barrel, so you could accidentally touch them, but I think the barrel design makes it simple enough to avoid that (the rotary switch is on a thicker barrel part, adjacent to the heating iron. The switch has 25 power levels, as well as an On/Off switch and indicator, and a &#34;Turbo Heat&#34; button and indicator.There is a small metal rest at the bottom of the barrel to help keep the hot barrel off surfaces when you place it down.The 5' cord is designed to swivel to minimize tangles.Conair backs the curling iron with a 2 year warranty.",5,Inexpensive Yet Functional,1395705600,"03 25, 2014",-0.0207

I keep it around the medium to medium high numbers and it curls in an instant. And I have uber thick hair.Touch ups are instant rather than waiting for the iron to heat up. If I am going out and find I've missed a spot I can basically now instantly reheat the iron and have it hot 30 seconds after I turn it on.Negative: I'm probaby odd in that I always hold my curling iron real close to the barrel. Because of this a few times I've accidentally turned the heat level without trying. Not a big deal, but something I'd change if I could to make the wheel maybe a little harder to turn.Conclusion: tops in my book. I won't go back to the curling irons of the past where I have to wait for them to heat.
