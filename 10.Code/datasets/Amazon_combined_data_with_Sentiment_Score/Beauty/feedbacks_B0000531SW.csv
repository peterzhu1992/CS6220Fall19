5,A3UDQ1RC5D8JDC,B0000531SW,Botticelli,"[0, 1]","Sand beige, online it looked medium fair, but its dark..really dark. I have to return it and hope they are nice about it.But this is the first time, since I order most make up online, that there is such a descrepancy between the color shown,and the color that arrived. I want to add, the make up and bottle is nice, but the color is so dark, I cannot use it. That has nothing to do with the fact however, that the make up would be fine I'm sure for someone else. I did not use it, I saw it, opened the lid, and clealy using it would be foolish. It really is too dark for me. It arrived in a timely manner, I should add that, it also is in fine condition, the label, the bottle etc. I wish there was a way to really tell a bit closer what color it really is. Thats what Im discourage about. I have bought make up online before, so again, this time, it was so light in appearance online that I felt it would work. Thanks for getting the product to me right away, it was a bargain at 4.01, but unfortunately color is not a match for me. It has to go back. I also wish they would put some sort of packaging on the bottle, so the lid would not be loose as well, perhaps some plastic to keep it closed, and tight knowing that it was not tampered with either. I wss also sent an email to not place this reviews and only allowed to review the seller and packaging? I see reviews on products all the time, the color on this was dark, not just a bit off, but a lot so beward.",3,Coor is way off how it looked online,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",0.1341
6,A1I82T8CMZSQYZ,B0000531SW,Brook607,"[3, 4]","I guess the coverage is ok, but I don't like the texture. It doesn't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to. It has a dry feel to it during application, but your skin doesn't look dry after you apply it. As I'm applying it, it dries up too quickly, and then I have to get more from the bottle. A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on. It also looks streaky after I'm done. It's hard to explain, but I just don't like it. I prefer cover girl.",2,Don't like the texture,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",-0.0509

Seriously, whats the point of a review if its going to be unfairly deleted? This was my experience. If anyone wants a bottle of makeup that can honestly be questionable...Ill dig it outta the trash for you. Its not going on my face. If I were happy w product Id say so. I'm not. Theres makeup on the side of the bottle. It doesnt look like it poured out from the top. What am I supposed to think and why send a lil glass bottle of foundation in a bubble mailer to begin w? Theres better ways of sending off products.UPDATE: Im going to change my stars for this product. Sometime after my review seller apologized and sent me a brand new product. For their effort in correcting the situation, they deserve props. Color of make up looks great. Thank you! Wore it to work today and three people said my skin looked great.

11,A33RXCY134VEBE,B0000531SW,JessLoisel,"[0, 0]","I purchased 2 shades, (creme cafe, and golden beige). My complexion is olive , medium tan. These colors are very similar, but the creme cafe was a tad deeper in color. A perfect match for me. The creme cafe feels like it has grit in the foundation, almost sandy.. but after smoothing it on, the grit dissapears. It has a slight painty smell to it. The other color is nearly odorless, and with no grit. Both containers were unsealed, and the original stickers were obviously scraped off. (Likely the clearence stickers). They didnt however, appear used. The containers were full and there was no excess makeup on the inside of the lids. the cost of these shades vary, but I got 2 for no more than $9.00! Way better than drugstore prices. The finish of this makeup is somewhat dewy, a healthy looking glow. If you have oily or combo skin, like me, you will want to wash, then tone, then prime your face before applying this, then follow with a powder in order to get a shine free look.",4,a good foundation..,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",0.1019
