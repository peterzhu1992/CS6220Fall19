It really cleans the scalp and hair without any residue. Pair it with any good conditioner and results are fabulous. This is cheapest and yet the best shampoo I have ever used! Highly recommend.",5,Love it,1350432000,"10 17, 2012",0.4718

It cleans thoroughly, leaves skin clear, removes the ick from hair and has a neutral fragrance that works with any suave conditioner. Also doubles as a body wash. The price in stores is about two dollars. I hope they never stop making this. Too many shampoos are filled with oil and silicone. This relieves my hair of the heaviness some products create. It's a steal.",5,cleanest hair ever!,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",0.2181
2,AJWOIC9QYV8AV,B0000530LP,Anna Jar AnnaJar,"[0, 0]",This is a great product at a great price. Hopefully it will be back in stock soon. We use it in place of soap to wash in the shower. Leaves no soap scum and works just great. It's also wonderful as a shampoo from time to time to clarify hair (it's original use).,5,Love this,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",0.4818

I would say it's my favorite now, it doesn't cost much, it does a good job, it doesn't strip my hair (I have &#34;Einstein&#34; hair when I let it get longer than a few inches) or dry my scalp. Smells nice, but not &#34;pretty&#34;.",5,"smells nice, feels clean",1359936000,"02 4, 2013",0.3794
4,A3NK6P0QFDUZL2,B0000530LP,G. Charles Steiner,"[1, 1]","This review is from: Suave Naturals Shampoo, Daily Clarifying 15ozThis shampoo does clean the hair, but it leaves thinning hair blowzy and dry. It does not moisturize in the least. There is a scent to the shampoo, too, which, while slightly feminine isn't potent and clinging, surprises this consumer because this shampoo is advertised as hypo-allergenic. Scents do cause allergic reactions in certain people, as Amazon reviewers here attest. The scent doesn't cause me any allergic responses like headaches.What bothers me is that though this shampoo is for normal to oily hair, it strips the hair of all oil, leaving it clean but very dry. Only a good conditioner can remedy the problem this shampoo causes. Also, this product contains the infamous lathering carcinogen, sodium laureate sulfate.",3,Okay But . . .,1385251200,"11 24, 2013",0.145

Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo (comes in clear-Blue or clear-White)washes away the daily grime of product use and can also be used to treat swimmer's hair in a pinch. For just under $2.00 it is a real gem, and if I wasn't such a die-hard Aubrey Organics fan, I'd use it every shampoo... Like I said, it's a real keeper (and great for all hair types) !

This is not the same as the Suave Naturals Shampoo Daily Clarifying formula that I used to purchase. Pleeeeeze, Suave.... remove the scent which burns the back of the throat of other people in the next room, and replace it with.... well.... nothing!

9,A2F1HRIJTUQOHJ,B0000530LP,Lyndsey,"[0, 1]",We use this exclusively for removing grease and oil from clothing before washing because it works great. We pretreat the stains and let the item sit and then throw it in a cold wash and this removes almost everything. I can wash light blue work jeans covered in black grease stains and make them look practically new. Fantastic!,5,Our go to product for laundry,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",0.3058

11,A250AXLRBVYKB4,B0000530LP,Nathan Beauchamp ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...,"[5, 7]","Suave shampoo is one of those products that I've used for most of my life. I've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little. Usually I'm a huge proponent of the 'you get what you pay for' way of thinking. However, there are exceptions that prove the rule, and this is one of them!That said, I have short, uncomplicated hair that's only dislike is conditioner (it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason). I don't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit, so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long, curly hair. For a guy (or woman with short hair) this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to: clean my hair. It's worth trying even if you think you might not end up loving it, simply because it's inexpensive, so if it doesn't work out, you've lost nothing.For the price, I can't find a shampoo that is as good. This is straight up the least expensive but highest quality shampoo out there. Recommended to anyone without complicated hair, for use with kids, or as an alternative to more expensive shampoo that does exactly the same thing.NOTE: I'd recommend getting this from Amazon directly to take advantage of their free shipping options.",5,Sometimes you do get more than you pay for!,1255910400,"10 19, 2009",0.2678
12,A4XWX7XXB7D4Q,B0000530LP,Palimino,"[0, 0]","I was searching and searching for a shampoo that wouldn't make my hair flat, dull, and greasy etc. I was also looking for a shampoo that wouldnt give me breathing attacks because i have very severe asthma and sinus problems. I found this shampoo and, it works great!.Unlike Wen, Tresseme, Garnier, and Matrix, which made my hair flat, dull, and greasy while also giving me suffocating breathing attacks, Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying made my hair thick, smooth, and shinier than I expected. I have been using this product for 3 months and, it works every time. I have gotten countless compliments on how sleek and healthy my hair looks, and even my best friend (who uses Wen) was astonished when I told her I use Suave, nothing more And, on top of it all, my breathing is now better in the shower (I literally used to suffocate and wheeze, espically when I used Wen and Garnier) I would recommend this for everyone. It is certainly worth the price, compared to a $60.00 9 ounce bottle of Wen. The good thing about this is that it actually works!! :D",5,Well worth the money. A great buy!,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",0.1488
