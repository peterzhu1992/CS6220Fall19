0,A2W10YRC8CWAD7,B0000530LO,Amazon Customer the undersigned,"[6, 8]","Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up. I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.The bottle says for normal to oily hair, but my hair is dry and I've never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world. If I didn't suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis.",5,Best Bargain Shampoo,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",0.7008
1,AJWOIC9QYV8AV,B0000530LO,Anna Jar AnnaJar,"[0, 0]",We only use this for occasional hair washing but use it daily as a replacement for soap in the shower. No more soap scum and it works great to clean the body! We always have many bottles in the house and refill a larger pump bottle from another shampoo is it's easy to use. Just one or two squirts on a washcloth is enough for a shower.,5,Favorite soap,1383523200,"11 4, 2013",0.2873

4,A2R9M9ALI356JU,B0000530LO,Jewel,"[1, 3]","For years I used the Redken's Clarifying Shampoo weekly on recommendation of my stylist. It has lemon and other citrusy fruits and really, I mean really cleans your hair. When you're done, your hair is squeaky clean. I ran out of that and this Suave Clarifying was the only clarifying shampoo I could find at Walmart which really had me baffled. I went ahead and bought it with the clarifying conditioner. Used it today and yes, it does clean the hair but no better than any other shampoo. My hair felt nice and soft and had very few tangles. But, it didn't really clarify like I wanted and I already have my favorite shampoo and conditioner. The funny thing was that the longer lasting fragrance was what was advertised on the bottle, not it's ability to clean hair. The scent wasn't bothersome to me and I am sensitive to fragrances. It smells like something between fresh and floral. I can't put my finger on it, but it's just fine. I'll probably use this about two times a week and hopefully the rest of the family will help me out using it up. I doubt I'll repurchase.",3,Basic Shampoo,1335830400,"05 1, 2012",0.2501

7,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B0000530LO,Margaret Picky,"[19, 22]","I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price. It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this, I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless. When I got home, I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product. I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original, almost-odorless formula.",1,"New bottle, tint, and perfume",1299888000,"03 12, 2011",0.3725

9,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,B0000530LO,PT Cruiser,"[26, 26]","I like using this shampoo after I've been in a pool with clorine or when I've used hairspray or other gel products on my hair. This really seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it soft and manageable.I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners, thinking they were much better for my hair than the grocery store brands. Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an under 4 oz. size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some. I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair, but also because it was cheap and I wouldn't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip. (I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk).I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my fine, flyaway hair just as clean and soft as as the more expensive brands. I couldn't tell the difference between this shampoo and my much more expensive salon brand! Still, I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip. I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water, weather, etc. That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since. I haven't found a single one that I don't like and I've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners. Two thumbs up for this product!",5,Cleans my hair and leaves it soft and managable,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",0.2774
10,A3RLFUK2L89G9C,B0000530LO,Symone,"[2, 2]",I am an African-American woman with 4a hair. I gave this shampoo a perfect score because it thoroughly cleaned my hair and scalp with drying it out or stripping it. My hair has low porosity so it can easily collect build up. It is important for the health of my hair to keep it as clean as possible. I use it about once a month. I also love the price. I bought it at Walgreens for only 75 cents. I was surprised that such a cheap product could work so well. I recommend this product to anyone with any hair type. I'm sure this product will work just as well with naturally straight hair. I am definitely going to use more products from this brand in the future.,5,A Great Product,1388361600,"12 30, 2013",0.3518
