Sometimes I go looking for something new but end up disappointed and upset that I ever thought to leave it (it's as close to a husband as I ever want to get).What I like about it:1. SPF is there. It's not a lot but it's there. With my other SPF makeup, I feel adequately protected.2. It absorbs quickly without taking everything with it. My skin stays soft and supple all day.3. It doesn't smell bad at all.4. IT DOESN'T BREAK ME OUT.5. My skin is extremely sensitive and with regular microdermabrasion, I am sometimes left with red, flaky skin that needs to be treated with love and care. This product doesn't exacerbate what my skin goes through and even also layers well with other moisturizers when I need backup.6. On days when I've gone without foundation and wearing only this, I've gotten complimented on how luminous my skin looks.Overall, it's an awesome product and I recommend it. As someone who also uses mostly high end products, I am amazed with how rarely Neutrogena lets me down. I thank them for saving me some serious green!",5,Old faithful,1348531200,"09 25, 2012",0.1853

Three days after starting Accutane, I ran out of my expensive moisturizer (Physiodermie - Oily Skin Cream - 50ml) and had to run to the drugstore to buy moisturizer. I had a meltdown because they didn't have Olay in stock and bought Aveeno, Cetaphil, and this. This is the best, by a long shot. It feels nearly as good as my expensive one, but it doesn't sink into the skin quite as fast. The only downside is the smell, which is of clay. I don't mind it, since that proves it is fragrance free-- I just wish it was a little less strong.My favorite drugstore moisturizer is stillOlay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, 1.7-Fluid Ounce, but I would definitely repurchase this neutrogena moisturizer!",5,An excellent drug-store moisturizer,1338854400,"06 5, 2012",0.1431

The product goes very far and you only need a little bit. This product is great for people with dry/semidry or combination skin. It helps combat dry skin in the places that need it without adding additional oil. It is also good to put under makeup. It causes much less foundation to be used up due to the fact that the skin is already moisturized. It also has SPF 15 which is great for the summer when you're not outside for long periods of time.

I have tried so many other products out there, Simple, Clinique, Coconut Oil, Oil of Olay, etc... and nothing worked. They were too greasy, too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight. Read many reviews on this, purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since. I use before my makeup every morning. 1 pump is plenty- apply to face, let dry (5 mins or so) and then apply makeup.

Their oil-free moisture lotion seems to go on too thick (compared to other products) and gives my skin a greasy, shiny, look when worn under makeup. I use it instead as a nighttime moisturizing cr&egrave;me before bed (because of it's thick consistency and shine).There are times when my skin gets especially dry and the moisture provided here, would not be enough. I would have to keep re-applying and re-applying on my especially dry skin, sometimes many times throughout the day. (I would need a more intense moisturizing product during those times). The moisture provided from this product isn't always enough.Neutrogena has a lot of very excellent skin moisturizing products. I also use their Healthy Defense daily moisturizer with tint, to use underneath makeup and add a touch of color to the face. That one goes on a little thick too, but it's worth it to have a natural glow. And it is more of a matte finish, without the oil or shine.My favorite is the Neutrogena Visibly Even moisturizer which I am able to apply both day and night, as it goes on very smooth, thin, and light. I find it most excellent for daytime use and it even provides a nice healthy glow. The visibly even Neutrogena product has added essential soy's and extra moisturizing ingredients to deal with even the driest of skins. It contains just the right amount of moisturizers to help my skin on the most driest of days, without being too thick and creamy, or greasy. It also covers skin blotches and dark spots as well.Before purchasing this facial moisturizer for the first time, I would take a look at some others that are out there.
