Now we just have this mounted on the shower stall wall. It is easy to keep clean and operates well.

5,A2RQOO8VYAEZZG,B00004TUBL,Cupcake,"[0, 0]","I've bought many of these over the years--not because they're so awesome, but because this is what I chose to begin with, and I break a bottle or so a year, and I've found it cheaper to buy the 4-chamber model with free prime shipping than order replacement bottles.Because the spout is at the bottom and the fill hole is at the top, you can't set these on a flat surface to refill, you have to hold them, which is awkward and makes them easy to drop. 75% of they time a bottle is dropped, unless it's completely empty, it will break. It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall. If the neck breaks, it's a goner.Aside from that (which is a big con--I would probably not choose the same design unless they changed the type of plastic in use or the design of the bottles), it's a nice dispenser and makes for a clean shower without a bunch of cruddy-bottled half-filled bottles. I have the 3-bottle and 3-bottle with mirror versions.",3,Bottles break VERY easily,1403136000,"06 19, 2014",0.22

When I have a need for another one, I naturally come back to the same brand, same style - the Classic - and ship and sold by amazon.I like the fact that when I need to refill, I can take each container out individually, plus the fact that there is one cover on the outside making it easy to keep it clean.Some other dispensers have 2 or 3 chambers and the chambers are all in one piece. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD3T2U/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1You have to slide the whole thing out even if you only need to fill one chamber when others are still full. In addition, the others not having a one-piece cover on the outside, water tends to get inside the chamber holding mechanism and mold can develop inside that you can't see without taking the chambers out. I have a couple of those that came with a house I bought. This also reinforces my decision in going back to the 4-chamber Classic one.",5,3rd one is a charm,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",0.2161

It took so many pumps to get all the conditioner I needed. Worked great for shampoo. Anything thicker than shampoo, forget it.

10,AW2CYR1UFNI1R,B00004TUBL,JP byaaah!!!!!!,"[7, 9]","This is the second Better Living Classic Dispenser IV I've purchased in the last twelve months and these things suuuuuuck. So why, you ask did I buy a second one??? Because one day recently as soon as I'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles, one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces. I'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid wouldn't have closed in the first place. Also, the unit was never bumped, jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose. So...manufacturing defect? I think so.Anyway, I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous, &#34;we'll send you one free of charge since it's our crappy product's fault.&#34; Instead, I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts (this is likely where they make most of their money). At over $5 for a cheap plastic bottle that I now know will shatter if dropped three feet, I was loath to buy one but basically had no choice. I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they don't ship to military APO addresses (which have California zip codes, BTW). I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost. Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid Better Living products altogether as there are many other &#34;better&#34; options out there.",1,Better Living is Worse Living,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",0.0287

I wanted to get rid of all the bottles and tubes in my tub as they were forever landing by my feet causing a risk for me to fall. This unit is superb. It was easy to install if you follow the clear instructions. Once up it takes 24 hours for the glue to cure and then you can fill the pumps. The bottles are quite large so you do not have to refill to often. Included in the package are labels so you can choose which pump goes for shampoo or shower gel or soap. I do not use conditioner so I used 3 pumps for shower gels and 1 for my shampoo. The products flow freely once you prime the pumps and so far there has not been a problem in pumping out generous amounts of gel and shampoo. It looks neat and clean in the tub and shower. It can be removed safely by sliding a knife down the back of the unit to disengage the silicone glue strips. It does not come with extra glue so if you were to move it you would have to purchase some silicone glue and about 4 contact strips which can easily be obtained in any store with hardware. I recommend this product highly.,5,NO MORE BOTTLES AND TUBES,1400716800,"05 22, 2014",0.2654

I like being able to switch back and forth, but hated having to pick which ones would be the lucky shower versions, and which would be put under the sink. It always turned out I'd have way too many bottles in the shower and then I found this!What a perfect solution. Not only does it store all of what I'm using, but if you're one of those parents who always find yourself saying to your children, What are you doing.... DRINKING THE SHAMPOO???.It dispenses the perfect amount, and though I paid twice this much somewhere else, I'd do it again in a heart beat.Its neat, its compact, and it works perfectly. I'm frankly thinking of giving it as a gift for those up and coming events that I'm not sure what they need or want.Update: I've had this for a few months now, and the savings in shampoo has more than paid for it.

18,ABFAO09KLTIFL,B00004TUBL,R. Reviewer,"[0, 0]","I installed this thing about a week ago. Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!",4,Works great.,1321142400,"11 13, 2011",0.2452
19,A1YZ8KOTNU1BEU,B00004TUBL,Tatiana,"[0, 0]",I had this at a previous home and couldn't take it with me due to the silicon adhesive which makes it very difficult to remove. I left it with the home and had to purchase another because i liked it so much. The adhesive is a definite advantage over double stick tape or other ways to affix things in the shower because it will never fall off despite the steam and condensation from normal shower climates.,5,2nd one,1378944000,"09 12, 2013",0.1594

That one lasted 11 years without a problem and I threw it out only because it looked old and I was moving. Flash forward to 2011. I decided to buy one for my condo. A day or two after I put in the bottles, I noticed shampoo from the dispenser dripping onto the faucet. It turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it. It was tiny but enough to cause a serious leak. I examined the bottles closely and realized how thin and cheap the plastic containers really are. Unbelievable. Now I have to decide whether to use Crazy Glue or go through the hassle of emptying the two other containers and sending the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund.
