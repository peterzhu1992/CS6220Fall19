0,A16DCOTN3OD46J,B00005333G,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]","I've bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone. The smell is light, the formula is light; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is, either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch. Now, even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face, using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser, I get this weird greasy feeling all over. Shortly after that is what I call the water stage, where as if by magic, my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top. I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel, because it looks like I've worked up a sincere sweat. I don't know what's wrong with this product, and I'm holding onto it to try in the dry winter months, but I'm not optimistic. At this point, I would not order it again.",2,Needed a light moisturizer,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",0.0593

Hydra Renewal smells so nice and feels good going on. It doesn't go on oily and soaks into my skin well. I have no problems using it on my face, around my eyes and neck area. I have had no problems applying sunscreen directly after and didn't end up with a greasy mess on my face. I like the price, too, which is affordable. This product is available at Walmart, as well.",4,non greasy.,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",0.2284

I changed up my cleanser and added this amazing moisture cream and its like I have new skin. It absorbs quickly and the results are amazing. Its made a definite positive impact on the look and feel of my skin. I put it on auto-delivery, cause I don't ever expect to have to look for another moisturizer.",5,My skin feels so soft again,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",0.2606
3,A68J3YO34TUOV,B00005333G,KatKanDoo,"[0, 0]","I've been using this cream for about a year now, I'm 44, and due to an immune disorder, I have Vitiligo, a VERY mild version of it, meaning, I'm still fairly pale but my skin is uneven and my face is darker than it used to be. I used to have peaches and cream skin (Irish, German & Italian heritage) but when I moved to Texas, it seemed like my skin disorder was activated. Anyway, even tho' growing up I wanted darker skin and tanned (I grew up in Long Island), as I got older I really realized the natural beauty of your true skin color. Well, too late ;-( about 12 years after running around Lady Bird Lake here in Austin, I came home and my skin was a yellowish tint. It was almost as if I'd gotten a sunburn but it didn't really go away ;-(I immediately started to exfoliate as much as I could, and did my best to stay out of the sun but long story short, my skin was permanently darkened because my immune system was compromised. So back to this cream, Loreal has always been a good product and reasonably priced but I particularly like this cream because1. It feels very cooling and soft when it goes on2. No filmy feel to it on your skin3. I actually like that it's a little heavy in the sense it can make my skin a little oily looking but I prefer that to dry and cakey looking4. It's cheap!5. It seems to help with my slight discoloration and does NOT add to my yellowish tone that I have acquiredDo NOT get this product if you like your skin very matte or a bit dry - or IF you get this - you'll need foundation/powder - I don't use foundation powder - as much as I struggle with my skin color (mostly I notice it - not too many others) I don't like foundation. I like feeling natural and free with my skin.Overall? This is my favorite day cream.",4,Luxurious feel for a good price,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",0.3031

8,A19AZMPE5ICZ9,B00005333G,Puddlejumper,"[2, 2]","Love the smell and texture of this creme, a very small amount goes a very very long way. The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good, and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.I did try this out under my make up, when i wear my Mac Studio Fix, I prefer to use Mac's prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven, not badly, but i saw a bit of a difference.Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough moisture.But i do love using this moisturizer to use with my cinema secrets creme foundation pallet, (must try ladies, and amazing beauty product)Overall I love the creme, will definitely re order, and for my break out sensitive prone skin, no issue either. Definitely recommend",4,wonderful smell and texture,1340668800,"06 26, 2012",0.7518
