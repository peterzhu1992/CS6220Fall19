0,A2W10YRC8CWAD7,B000052YMV,Amazon Customer the undersigned,"[1, 1]","Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find. I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives, but Cetaphil doesn't cause me to break out, itch, or dry up.I'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar, as bars can cause one to have clogged pours (read: blackheads).The only downside is that it won't remove makeup very easily, so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This bottle is rather large. I use it to refill my 4 oz bottle since it's cheaper to buy 16 ounces at a time.",5,Best Bang for your Buck,1113264000,"04 12, 2005",0.457
1,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,B000052YMV,Bonnie Sayers autismfamily,"[1, 3]","At first I thought this was something just for the face, but I quickly learned when I perused the back label that this is for the body as well and can be used on babies. This is meant to retain needed moisture and I notice immediately a glistening on one arm when I compared both arms.This can be used while in the shower and rinse off after applying and rubbing gently. I prefer to use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser without water. The cleanser is a clear/off white gel type of texture that rubs into the skin with a light lather. There is no scent evident when squeezed into the hand or rubbed into the skin. With a cloth you can easily remove the excess, while leaving a thin film on the skin. There is no tight feeling to the skin, just soft and smoothness.The gel cleanser is not gooey to touch and works rather quickly in obtaining clean skin for the entire body. I prefer to use it on my hands and legs and sometimes go for the face. This is much better than using soap on my sensitive skin and leaves it moist and almost glowing.The bottle is clear so you can see when you are low and plan on restocking. I have some left still since I do not use it on a daily basis. The problem I have is the bottle is too large to fit someplace where I can remember it and see it daily in the bathroom, so it is confined to the bottom cabinet below the sink and it gets pushed back when new items are placed there.The statement on the bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser states, Softens As It Cleanses, one that I totally agree with and can attest to as an eczema sufferer.",4,Good cleanser for those with eczema,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",0.2546

I have been having a horrible time with my skin due to the harsh Wisconsin winter and this face wash is just what I needed in conjunction with the new serum and moisturizer I am using, that I posted reviews about.This face wash didn't irritate my already extremely irritated, itchy red skin that was not enjoying the fact that I was having difficulty figuring out what to do with it, because it became that way out of no where. I have had to completely change my skin care regime, because my normal routine suddenly stopped working...badly. I tried multiple serums, moisturizers, etc. This face wash along with the other two products I have reviewed were the only things that saved me from scratching my skin raw. It definitely doesn't hurt that my skin looks amazing too!FYI, in conjunction with having very sensitive skin, I also have rheumatoid arthritis, which is an inflammatory disorder that I am on multiple medications for and my skin is extremely picky about what I can use on it. This skin cleanser is a life saver.",5,Thank you to all the reviewers for suggesting this face wash,1231286400,"01 7, 2009",0.1342
3,A1I7S292TS0ZOR,B000052YMV,Lee Lee,"[1, 1]","The texture of the cleanser takes some getting used to; it does not spread over the skin like soap so I can't get away with a couple of squirts on a washcloth to wash my whole body. I have dry, sensitive skin and mild adult acne that gets worse with exercise and the hot weather. In the month I used this (only lasted me that long) I realized I wasn't breaking out the way I used to. When I ran out I tried another, less expensive product that was also supposed to be dermatologist recommended. I broke out the next day and had itching in areas that weren't itchy using Cetaphil. I'm going back to Cetaphil but to make it last longer I'm just using it on my face and sensitive areas. I think it's worth it.",5,did make a difference,1344816000,"08 13, 2012",0.0095

It's the best, non drying and non-abrasive cleanser I've ever used... and while it is a bit pricey (I'm pretty cheap lol) it's worth it and the bottle (used by my eldest daughter and myself) lasts us 6 months! And you can use it without water if you needed too! It's amazing!Honestly, I will use this stuff forever. :)LOVE it!",5,Best cleanser for dry skin!!!,1319155200,"10 21, 2011",0.3547
5,A2D914K7LL3TM0,B000052YMV,Web it up,"[5, 5]",Ever since my friend told me about Cetaphil a few years ago I have not used any thing else! Since then I have been introducing my friends and family to Cetaphil soaps and creams. Not only does it make your face and body so smooth and soft but I think it makes you look younger. I have noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead seem to have diminished a little. I highly recommend the lotions and face creams. This is a great product for all ages of women. You will feel the diffence on your skin as soon as you apply it!,5,It's the Best!,1076976000,"02 17, 2004",0.2947
