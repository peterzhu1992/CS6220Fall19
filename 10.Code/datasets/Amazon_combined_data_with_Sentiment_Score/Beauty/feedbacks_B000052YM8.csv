1,A2YB5103AQ463Z,B000052YM8,A. Smith,"[2, 3]","I'm nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts. The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone. This product is not only keeping my skin clearer, thus avoiding more red marks, it's also fading the red marks that were already there. My face hasn't been this clear in a long, long time. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It goes on nice and light under makeup - I can't even tell it's there. I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself.",5,This product is saving my skin,1265241600,"02 4, 2010",0.1067
2,A24FGO73P2QI4L,B000052YM8,barbara babich,"[0, 0]",It is a little harsh but I suppose that is the nature of the acids. I don't use it every day. But it compares favorably to other similar products I have used.,5,a fine exfolliant,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",0.1079

5,AYY1OER56P6MD,B000052YM8,candice warren,"[0, 0]","Since I tend to have acne scars and dark spots around my face, I decided to try this after so many good reviews. I wasnt disappointed only except for the fact that it needed a pump. Other than that, its light, absorbs quickly and does what its supposed to do and my skin looks more even and soft.",5,Good stuff,1384300800,"11 13, 2013",0.2875
6,A3PTZFRD34YJ2P,B000052YM8,ForeverWild,"[0, 0]","Happy with my purchase. Keeps skin clear and smooth. I bought this for my fine lines, and have noticed a slight improvement. That's all that can be expected from a topical product, so I am happy. Worth the money and since a little goes a long way, it lasts a while. I use morning and night, and use an SPF during the day.",5,Great product,1306454400,"05 27, 2011",0.3885
7,A2ODIWTLSE3QNF,B000052YM8,Healthy Cynic,"[2, 3]","I'm 48 and Mom is 75 yrs old and ANY moisturizer gives us immediate acne. I'm glad I found this again, the AH souffle is a tad oily. The no-oil formula is a godsend, no more breakouts. The product exfoliates according to how much and how often you use it (overuse will get you a red face). It provides a gentle peel effect that starts working quickly drying up oil and acne. I like the rate of peel; no scaly face. In 2-3 months I had smoother skin, slightly smaller pores, and better skin tone. Using Alpha Hydroxy I have received the first EVER complements on my skin. I have very few wrinkles for my age. I'm not saying I look 30, but I look good. Mom's a recent convert, her skin has smoothed and she has noticed a difference.",4,IF MOISTURIZER MAKES YOU BREAK OUT...,1308528000,"06 20, 2011",0.2174

10,A3OQNWCOITZSSH,B000052YM8,Jaq,"[0, 3]","I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne. I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me. I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference. It's on par with using 2% salicylic acid, which doesn't do much. I won't be repurchasing this as I don't feel it's worth the money.My products:Morning- 15% Benzoyl Peroxide face wash, 1% clindamycin lotion (prescription)Afternoon - 1% Clindamycin lotionNight - 10% Benzoyl peroxide creamI tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off. It's better than using nothing but barely.",2,Not sure it made a difference,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",-0.0137
11,A2YANT4VAX6MH3,B000052YM8,Kevin,"[0, 4]","I am sure it works anyway but I hate the fact that its so watery though I am sure a little bit goes a long way with the watered down type formula. Also I paid $10.50 Which pisses me off. I was looking for a cheaper price around $7.00 and just now seeing it after purchasing it last week. Trust me, I couldn't find it for any less than $10 last week when I ordered. Anyway, its all good.",3,Not really sure but,1351900800,"11 3, 2012",0.0521

I can tell it's working because I get a mild burning sensation shortly after I apply it, but it's not bothersome and goes away after a short time. The price is beyond reasonable.",5,Good stuff for the price!,1358121600,"01 14, 2013",0.3846
13,AUFB3GQJV10P0,B000052YM8,LMOND00,"[0, 0]",This product makes my skin look smooth but I have to use it sparingly. It can dry your skin so I use it every two days.

15,A2BY7LRPQI9YZQ,B000052YM8,Rusalochka,"[3, 5]","The product itself is WONDERFUL!!! Though the seller that is being fulfilled by Amazon sent me expired, OXIDIZED product that is completely worthless. Didn't do a thing! Even had a brown tint to it -- gross!! I understand this review isn't fair to the product, but Amazon doesn't sell it directly therefore there isn't much to do. Plus, I wanted to inform you guys that there's a big change you too will receive a defective, brown, goopy mess!",3,Great Product -- BUT BEWARE! MAY BE EXPIRED!,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",-0.0486
16,A8RP3ZW268BK2,B000052YM8,Sara,"[0, 0]","I am using this in tandem (switching nights) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin, so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically. That said, I do know that I have had no problems with this product. I was concerned that it would irritate my skin, as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness, but I have had no such issues at all. It seems to be the gentlest of the products that I use. My skin is looking (relatively) fantastic lately, and this probably has something to do with it!",4,Seems like a decent product,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",0.013
17,AD2Z9L0R8P586,B000052YM8,Scorps,"[1, 3]","AHA products break some people out terribly, and that's what happened to me. At least now I know to be extra wary of AHA. I used it for a month, and reduced the number weekly applications once my face started freaking out. Unfortunately it did not get better from there. Based on the research I did prior to purchasing, this is probably a good product to buy if you already know AHA doesn't give you evil acne, and you don't mind a bunch of parabens.",1,It Happens.,1360540800,"02 11, 2013",-0.1507
18,A10GUAYV0VENIN,B000052YM8,Shawna,"[2, 2]","Highly recommend for oily skin. Could be a little drying for other skin types, though. I have had excellent results with this product, and I have tried EVERYTHING, both over the counter and prescription. I find this works best during my downtime from Renova--I take 3-6 months off after an 18-month stretch to give my skin a break. During the down time I use ROC at night and this in the morning. It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on, just gentler. Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product!",5,This is one of the best products I have ever used on my skin,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",0.3356
