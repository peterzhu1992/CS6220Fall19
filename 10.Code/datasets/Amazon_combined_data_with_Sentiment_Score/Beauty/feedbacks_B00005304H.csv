The sticks were harder and the cotton wasn't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference!So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent (and soft) toilet paper as well.Some things just aren't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget.",5,Nothing but Qtips by Brand ...,1274659200,"05 24, 2010",0.1212

For us the swabs stayed intact and firm and did not unravel as was noted with other reviewers. In fact that was what the store brands did. The only reason that we did nto give a five star rating is that soem of the swabs were packed so tightly on the ends they did not absorb much.",4,Qtips Are The Best,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",0.1247

I have used every other brand, found in countless hotel rooms and even resorts. I love the softness and fullness of the cotton swabs, and this was a pretty good value on Amazon.

Well, these are the only things that will do the job. So, as I said, I recently bought some more. And may I say that I hate the generic versions of Q-tips: the CVS brand or Target version of Q-tips are weak. They bend when you apply any pressure to them. I like Q-tips because they are much stiffer and hold up perfectly when used.~Q-Tips, you have let me down.~My recent purchase has led me to discover that Q-tips have changed their formula: The shafts are now much weaker than before and are identical to those knock-off brands I mentioned earlier. This is a travesty. It's obvious that they are trying to save money by using less paper in the design of these things, but it's terrible. They don't hold up like they used to and it's driving me nuts. I now HATE Q-tips and will be buying the cheaper knock-off brands since they are now equal in quality.~Q-Tips, shame on you.",1,"Q-Tips, you've changed...",1283817600,"09 7, 2010",-0.2158

I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks - but now I regret it.I usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree, for a dollar of course, and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me.

Well, I have never followed that advice. :-) I use Q-tips to get water out of my ears when I get out of the shower. Other cotton swabs don't have the cotton as tightly wound and cheaper discount brands have left little strands of the stuff behind - whether in my ears or when using for a craft project or other purpose.Also very handy for cleaning the grooves in your outer ear, Q-tips brand are the most comfortable. I have used other brands, but they feel like you're dragging a tree branch around your outer-ear, not smooth cotton.Good for cleaning your dog's or cat's ears as well (just don't put them in too far!) - and just a good product for about a million uses. I've even used them to get shoe polish into hard-to-reach groves in dress shoes - and Q-tips brand doesn't leave fiber strands behind like the others do!",5,best cotton swabs you can get on a stick,1071619200,"12 17, 2003",0.3958
