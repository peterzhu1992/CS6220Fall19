0,A3SZAN83WQGL2I,B000052YJD,HalloweenGal,"[0, 0]","I purchased this after researching what would best help/prevent my flaky, dry skin. The extra gentle Buf-Puf is great for every day cleansing. I use a dab of cleanser, wet the puff and make little circles over my skin. It is just enough exfoliation to get the dead cells off, but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin. I follow up with my skin care regimen (serum, toner, moisturizer) and this little puff has helped make a world of difference.Being the first time that I have used one of these, I am not sure how long they normally last, but I have gotten a good two and weeks of daily use out of mine, before noticing that it was beginning to lose it's structure a bit.",4,Buf-Puf,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",0.1847

2,A1739RDYJNA6HT,B000052YJD,LimeyLe,"[2, 2]",I bought this Extra gentle sponge in search of a certain texture. I seems like a great sponge but it just too rough for my sensitive skin. I ended up using this as a body sponge so as not to waste my purchase.,2,still too rough for me,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",0.4827

On the other hand, it really is &#34;extra gentle&#34; so maybe I just purchased the wrong intensity.",3,A bit flimsy,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",0.2767
4,A3Q9XJFJLGO7Y4,B000052YJD,sue,"[0, 0]",Ok so I wanted a buffer I could use with my face cleanser that was suuper gentle so I could use it every night with my face wash. It is gentle but if you press at all it is not so gentle. So just don't over do it with the srcubbing. easy to hold and use to scrub face. TIP: You should only be exfoliating with this at night because exfoliating makes your skin a bit red. So make this your night time routine.,3,Not that gentle,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",0.0983
5,A1JM88SQKGXAVG,B000052YJD,"Susan Kay Geek, reader, homeschooler","[0, 0]","The regular version of these Pufs is way too rough, can't imagine using them on anything but elbows and heels. This extra gentle version is better for facial skin, exfoliates nicely. I use it with Neutrogena Facial Bar, rinse it well, and air dry it on end on a soap tray between uses. It does begin to pill slightly after a couple months but lasts a good long time as long as you carefully rinse it and prop it up to dry out. This is the most cost effective exfoliating treatment available. Too bad its only available online.",4,Extra Gentle for sensitive facial skin,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",0.2937

Too fragile and falls apart/shreds.I do use other, more sturdier Buf Puf sponges and have been for years and do like the line.",3,Does not last long,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",0.2997
