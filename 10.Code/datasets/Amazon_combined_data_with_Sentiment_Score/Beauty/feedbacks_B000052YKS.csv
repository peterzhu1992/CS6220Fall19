3,A1DC1O4VX6AHPP,B000052YKS,E. A. Jones movie buff,"[0, 0]","After reading that alternating cleansers was better for your skin than using the same one every day, I decided to try this one for every-other-day use. How I use it: Put about a nickle sized dollop on my fingertips and rub it into my face, then gently rinse by wiping off with a warm soft washcloth. I often put my face under the shower faucet for a brief 2-3 second rinse after that, too, which I know many skincare professionals discourage, but I find I get a better rinse that way, especially in the area where my face meets my hair.Basis is a thinnish gel consistency which feels great to the touch, and has a wonderful scent. It cleans well, though I found it wasn't very good at taking off makeup. For days when I don't wear makeup, it's just fine, but when trying to take off the usual foundation and powder, some was always left behind and I had to grab a second cleanser. For the usual oil, dust, etc., though, it's good.There's a slick feeling to the skin after you use it, which doesn't come off no matter how much you rinse. I wasn't fond of that at first but have come to get used to it. That alone was enough to make me decide not to buy a second bottle.But the biggest problem was for the more delicate skin under and around my eyes. I'm 42 so my under-eye skin has definitely had changes since I was younger, and it's much less able to take a strong cleanser. Basis left red patches in the under-eye area near the nose, and though moisturizer helped, there were dry flakes left behind. Even if it looked okay at a glance, when I put makeup on it was very noticeable. I avoid that area now and it's all good -- my forehead, chin and nose were the oiliest parts anyway -- but unless your entire face is oily, this may not be the cleanser for you.I'm a little disappointed because the price, the consistency and the scent are perfect, but there are just too many cons for me to buy a second time.",3,"terrific scent, consistency and cleaning, too harsh on skin",1397865600,"04 19, 2014",0.2274
