It photographs beautifully and works well for any skin tone and especially shows up the teeth. I couldn't find it locally and was happy to find it online. I am glad I did. It really is a pretty color. A heads up it is a dark cherry color for those use to wearing lighter shades of lipstick.,5,Love the Color!,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",0.3779

I don't use this by itself, I use it for a perfect ombre lip. I take any lip liner and outline my lips, and hen fill in the sides. Then I take this lipstick and put it on the center of my pout. Then I smush them together, and I have a nicely faded ombre lip. I get compliments every time. I have found that my ombre lip works BESTEST ;) with this lipstick.

5,A2LP3OVZRYMBLS,B0000531WZ,CME,"[0, 0]","I bought this Revlon Kiss Me Coral lipstick about a month ago for the first time. Although it is labelled as Coral, it is actually more like it looks in the picture--a slightly orange-y red. I was nervous about that when I purchased it, but it turns out it actually is very flattering with my skin--I have very light, fairly neutral skin (I do get red cheeks, but with foundation it evens out). It works well whether it's applied and blotted just a little bit (for a nighttime look usually) or for a daytime look, if it's blotted a lot it looks like more of a stain.I also think it looks very pretty when I use it as a cream blush (very lightly applied of course). It's a creme lipstick, so it's not sparkly and it's also not matte--very creamy and smooth. It lasts rather long as a lipstick actually, and for me I need minimal applications throughout the day.When I originally bought this, I was looking actually for a lighter more true coral color (I was thinking more pink) but I guess I'm just attracted to bright reds! I am glad I went with my instincts and chose this.",5,Beautiful Color,1321056000,"11 12, 2011",0.4853

7,A21AJWWROH0OA8,B0000531WZ,CS,"[4, 5]","When it comes to many beauty products, I'm a big fan of going for the drugstore brands over the higher-end luxury brands and this Revlon lipstick does not disappoint! They're very pigmented and moisturizing, which is great for my chronically chapped lips. The color goes on smooth and I don't find it feathering out or flaking after a few hours like I do with many other lip colors.I was looking for some nice colors for fall and bought these in Rum Raisin and Raisin Rage, which go great with my medium Indian skin tone. Rum Raisin is a softer pinkish red color, which is beautiful for the daytime. Raisin Rage is a bolder red-burgundy. I didn't find it nearly as purple as the picture shows. It's awesome for the fall, and is that perfect red color I was looking for, without looking too 90s.Knocked off one star for staying power. This didn't last too long on me. Then again, most lipsticks don't due to my dry, chapped lips. The moisturization and pigmentation more than makes up for it. I don't mind touching up every now and then.

If you don't want to splurge on mac then get revlon lipsticks. They're highly pigmented and feel so nice on the lips. I don't even need to use a lip liner with them. They last about 1-2 hours before I reapply them.

19,A20IG24DLFALIA,B0000531WZ,Lisa Gem,"[1, 1]","I've used this color for the past 15 years, and I've enjoyed the texture, quality, and color every time. Difficult to find, often sold out, and there is a good reason for that. It is a great neutral shade that goes on lighter on than the tube photo shows, which is more of a medium color. Not too dark, not to light. My friends use this and we are mature women with mature skin. Back in the day when I used to still tan, it also looked great, but it also does well with fair to medium skin tones. I no longer tan my face, and this gives my pale lips lots of color without washing out my white with freckles face! I find the color is flattering with most everything I wear except orange and warm reds, which is not in my wardrobe.My colors is considered to be between Summer and Winter (Color Me Beautiful book)and that basically means I usually wear the cool colors, not the warm ones. I don't find it to be super long lasting, but I actually prefer that. It feels great on my lips, and I don't mind reapplying it after eating. Taste is nothing special. I don't notice any lipstick taste unless I'm using a flavored fruit type of lip balm, so not sure what other reviewers were expecting it to taste like. Hope that helps someone decide which colors they want. One other add: I bought this on a subscription delivery schedule, but I noticed that it has increased to over $2 more than last month.

I like that it has just enough moisture so it doesn't dry out your lips.
