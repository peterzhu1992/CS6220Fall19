For that I got four of the deluxe book stands in wood, which could hold the largest study Bible. But now, that BIG desk is filled with monitors, and I have far less room for beefy book stands. Enter these small stands which, by the way, are perfect for Kindles, and which can fold away when not in use. They have an air of delicacy, but if you use them carefully, they have an important role in the changing face of bookpropology.",5,Very portable.

It is more for books you put would put on a table or desk to read. Not for say taking on a bus to read a paperback. The flipklip is great for doing that. This one is more of a I have to type from a textbook onto my computer kind of thing. It holds all books but thick volumes like a dictionary. This one is great for holding a cookbook while you are stirring a pot, for learning to type and it holding the book open, for hardbacks that you just don't want to hold with your hands and have it hold it open for you, things like that.",5,Nice Product!,1192752000,"10 19, 2007",0.3093
3,A2LEIANN1UZTHP,B00006B8HT,brainout,"[0, 0]","Golly, I'm so grateful I found this on Amazon. It just arrived yesterday, ordered two days prior, God love Prime! I had another one for years, which I somehow misplaced. Its flexibility makes it more than just a medium-sized book holder. On the surface, it seems to be good only for your average NASB-sized hardback Bible (about an inch thick). So the rest of this review is about how ELSE you use this thing.Right now, as I type, I've got the left 'hook' hanging over my flat-panel monitor. So the thing is hanging by that left hook, diagonally (askew), and upside down. The back long 'legs' are folded out, so think of the thing as in standing position.. but upside down. A plastic clamp (could use even a big paper clip) holds a bunch of papers together, for input (about 10). So this 'sturdy stand' also acts like a monitor clamp at eye-level, without the adhesive and flimsy plastic holders which so easily break. The stand's rubber feet protect the metal ends from harming the monitor; frankly, the one hanging off the monitor isn't even touching the screen. So two vital uses, not just one.You can also use the thing to prop up large/heavy books. Or, to hold any size book yet allow you to turn the pages. So, now it props up my huge Shakespeare book (about 2 thick?), also here in Amazon, by Royal Shakespeare Company. Or, ponderous short 3-inch (maybe 2+?) notebooks. You just use the stand differently. [A European style X-shaped dish rack, especially wood, is also useful.] How? Again, upside down. I put the Shakespeare book on a mat, turned the 'sturdy stand' upside down and turned the back legs TOWARD each other. Could use a rubber-like place mat, if reading from a table. Something to give more traction for a heavy book. Much better than your typical book holder, because it tilts backwards, and the upside down 'hooks' add support.Okay, so now suppose you don't need to read a book. You can fold the thing sideways and store it just about anywhere.. or, you can HANG it, using the forward 'hooks' for clothing, accessories, you-name-it.That's a lot of sturdy value, for five bucks. In fact, why did I buy only one? My bad!",5,More than just a bookholder,1319760000,"10 28, 2011",0.1561

I cannot sit at a table for hours, bending my neck forward to read a textbook, etc. All in all, it does hold small to medium sized books, as well as light electronics like tablets. However, I've found that it can be unreliable when turning pages.Design - the wires used are of good strength and quality, and is very easy to fit into place. Very intuitive to use.Strength - as I've mentioned, it can hold a small to medium book. Sometimes, wider books can be difficult to position.Turning Pages - I struggled with with this stand when I was turning pages. Sometimes pages would get stuck, but most of the time, the stand slightly moves, forcing me to fix the stand again.Overall, a great idea and great value falls short because it can be unreliable sometimes. However, keep in mind that this may just be my own unique experience. Others may have better luck than me.",3,I really want to like it - but this stand falls short,1319673600,"10 27, 2011",0.3547

It's inexpensive and easily folds up so that you can throw it in a bag.For my office, though, I ended up buying a more durable wooden stand.

14,A2OL5WLCNZVD9K,B00006B8HT,nonpareil,"[1, 1]","I bought this in order to be able to prop heavy books in front of me on a table and also for use as a tabletop music stand on the occasions when I don't use a regular floor music stand.The item is well made of heavy-weight wire which is to say round metal rods bent precisely. It folds flat and can be easily stowed, either flat or hung from a hook. Folded, the dimensions are 6 1/2 X 9 1/2 X 11/16. Unfolded and ready for action, the space between the two holders is 6. The arms that extend upward to hold the pages in place are 1 3/8. These arms, therefore, do interfere somewhat with the turning of pages. No easy way 'round that. The spaces to hold the book are only 1 1/2 so you can't put a really thick book on this. That IS a drawback as you have to consider the entire thickness of the book, not just when you are reading in the middle of it. (The illustration, which I consider a bit deceptive, shows what appears to be a dictionary open to its middle. No way could that happen on this stand with my Webster College!) Also this device holds the material at quite an erect angle that cannot be adjusted. It seems an appropriate angle, though.The stand comes with little rubber tips in a plastic bag so you have to put them on the exposed metal tips yourself, no biggie. I do suggest a bit of Super Glue, having lost plenty of these protective tips over time.",3,"Well made, but not for thick books.",1322697600,"12 1, 2011",0.0337

17,A3NEAETOSXDBOM,B00006B8HT,Stephen M. Charme,"[37, 38]","I was looking for a bookstand that would not take up too much space on my desk at work, could easily be folded for storage when not in use, and on which I could read both professional magazines and my Amazon Kindle. This unit does the trick, but has its shortcomings.I have the following comments:1.There is no practical way to adjust the angle at which books or magazines are read. The only way to decrease the angle is by moving the back legs of this unit wider apart, but doing so moves the front legs closer together to the point where you cannot place a book on them. The reading angle is a bit more than I would like, but I have gotten used to it.2. This unit works fine on a small hardcover book (9x6x1), but not as well on a paperback book of the same size. The reason is that a hardcover book stays open more easily by itself, and the front legs on this unit do not keep a small paperback book fully open; you will have to press it with your hands to keep it fully open.3. There is no problem with a larger paperback book (10x7.5x1.25) since the weight of the book is enough to keep it open.4. This unit does not really work with any book thicker than 2 inches.There are other bookstands that have angle adjustments and hold books more easily, particularly larger books. However, those bookstands are more expensive, take up more space on your desk, and do not store as easily as this unit. Therefore you need to decide what your needs are. While this unit has its shortcomings, it is relatively inexpensive and easy to handle.My primary use is reading my Kindle and magazines.

(they give you around 1 1/2 inches). I also like that it's simple in it's design, all metal with plastic end pieces. The one flaw with this is that they need a piece going up through the center and topping it by about five inches since regular paper just folds over the top of the stand. I did remedy this by putting a metal ruler through it and it works fine. But even so, what was Fellowes thinking when they designed it?

20,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B00006B8HT,trebe,"[2, 2]","It might be hard to believe, but this type of wire stand has probably been around for over 35 years. It is simple and easy to use. You just unfold the legs, and set it up on a suitable surface. When you are done, it folds up into a relatively small space for easy storage or transport. It works pretty well for many hardback books, and some paperbacks as well.The stand is made out of silver colored steel rods, and has two legs that swivel out from the frame. The legs don't extend back too far, and the frame is small, but the stand is still fairly stable, and can be used with larger books. On the opposite end of the legs, the rod is bent up 90 degrees, forming a section designed to hold the pages open. This section is a little over an inch high, which isn't a lot. Besides swiveling the legs, not much adjustment is possible.When opened, hardbacks tend to stay open, while the opposite is true of most paperbacks. That being the case, this stand works pretty well with most hardbacks less than 1.4 thick, and some midsized paperbacks. It doesn't do so well with smaller pocket sized paperbacks, and large oversized paperbacks.The adhesive backing of paperbacks tends to close the pages when opened, so for paperbacks of a certain size, you may have some difficulty using the stand, unless you don't mind over bending the spine of your paperback to crack it open. You can also adjusting the position of the legs, to try and lock the pages in place, which might possibly crinkle your pages, or make turning pages an adventure. A larger, really stiff paperback, could possibly tip the stand over, as the pages attempt to close.Quality control concerning the legs is another issue. In a clever design, the wire is twisted around to form a series of spirals, which are then inserted onto vertical rods on the frame, forming a hinge. Sometimes the fit of the hinge is too tight, but a loose fit is more common, and unfortunately legs that swivel too easily can make the stand less stable. Because the legs are usually not exactly the same, the stand probably won't be perfectly level. One leg is usually higher, so you might need to adjust the position, or even bend them a bit.This product is very durable. I have a couple of them that are over 20 years old, and while the silver finish has a little corrosion, and some of the legs are loose, but unless a weld fails, the stand should last well past my lifetime.Fellowes apparently likes this design, as after many years, it seems largely unchanged. I feel that they could have made a version with a larger frame, that elevates the book higher, and also has higher posts in the front to hold back the pages better, but what do I know.Besides books, the stand can also be used for any number of flat objects, like sheet music, a magazine, record albums (remember them?), or even an e-reader like a Kindle or Nook. It might be a bit pricey for what it is, but it's nearly indestructible, so you probably won't be replacing it anytime soon.",4,"nearly indestructible, with a design that hasn't changed much in decades...",1343692800,"07 31, 2012",0.2632
