It's a very large roll that comes out of a side slot that makes it very easy to cut with your scissor. Meanwhile, the unused portion stays neatly in the box.",5,Easy To Use,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",0.4946
1,A1PWOOUWW1NJC1,B00006IBLJ,D. Stotler,"[0, 0]",I use this bubble wrap to protect smaller items that I ship all over the country. The 12' width and the perforations every foot make it easy to detach each piece if necessary without having to use scissors or a knife. The smaller bubble size is more adaptable to smaller items.,5,Protect What You Ship,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",0.2741

I can, however, get excited about the value you'll get on Amazon.If you need bubble wrap for shipping at a good price, this is a good deal.Note: Most bubble wrapping will stick to your shipped product if you're sending it across state/country in 100+ degree weather, the product material is susceptible to it (glossy book cover, plastics, etc.)and the barrier between the wrapping and the outside of the shipping container is minimal in thickness. Be aware of this and cover your product with something prior to applying the bubble wrap to ensure your product won't stick to it (i.e. a single layer of wrapping tissue around the product)",5,It's hard to get excited about cushion wrap.,1261440000,"12 22, 2009",0.2233
3,A235UFZGCFN3J5,B00006IBLJ,Eva,"[1, 2]",I bought this particular bubble wrap for two reasons: I wanted a good quality bubble wrap and I wanted a larger quantity. I got both with this wrap. It tears every 12 if needed and the 100 feet box goes far. I got tired of buying the smaller size bags of bubble wrap and only being able to wrap a few small items before the bag was empty. Not a problem with this size. I'll buy this bubble wrap again.,5,Very happy with this bubble wrap,1298160000,"02 20, 2011",-0.0081

Not really much more to ask for, it's just bubble wrap. :)",5,Good bubble wrap,1367280000,"04 30, 2013",0.3695
5,ARTM1R17MOIJA,B00006IBLJ,Johnson Family,"[0, 0]",What's better than lots of bubble wrap to dance on (or wrap produces for shipping)? Bubble wrap in neatly perforated squares!

6,A2BPW3FD2JR9ZT,B00006IBLJ,J. Pak,"[0, 0]","I purchased 2 of these for my recent cross-country move to protect my kitchen-wares and fragile stuff (e.g. lamps, picture frames, a porcelain owl, etc.). I did not lose any dishes, cups, bowls, and other fragile items during the move I'm sure in part thanks to the Scotch Cushion Wrap. The perforations 12 inches help make it easy to tear proper lengths of bubble wrap and you can easily fold or stack them back up for re-use. I have no complaints and will probably buy again for my next move.",5,Provide good protection,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",0.4472

The plastic is perforated approx every 12 inches so you can tear off as much as required. Excellent for wrapping.",5,Great pricing made in USA,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",0.3311
8,AJRDRD3SDD28X,B00006IBLJ,Lynne,"[0, 0]","I'm ordering another one of these: the bubble-wrap is of high quality, and the mailing box kept it that way. It's worth it to me to pay just a bit more to get a reliable product.",5,Well-protected by box,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",0.064
9,A141OPVE376YFI,B00006IBLJ,Paul Gifford,"[10, 12]","This bubble wrap is quite a bargain, especially compared to what it costs at a local office supply store. Even though the bubble wrap is in a box, that box is placed in a larger box for shipping...it's like Amazon is throwing in a box for free!I always buy perforated bubble wrap now - it reduces the time to it takes to wrap items. I occasionally sell things via online auction just to make a few dollars, not as a living. The less time I spend wrapping goods the better.As a bonus, even though the bubbles are smaller they still make a satisfying popping sound...bubble wrap isn't just for shipping things, it's for stress relief too!Buy this - free shipping + free box + made in the USA = a great value.",5,Quite a bargain,1314662400,"08 30, 2011",0.4435
10,A1JBMZRN6M3NKC,B00006IBLJ,roman310,"[0, 1]","It was important that I receive this fast because I was going to move fast. It arrived in the scheduled time frame. Quality bubble wrap, worked well for protecting my stuff during shipment... but...not much can stop UPS and the way they throw around your packages like a sport. They still managed to break some things somehow. The next time I moved I had a UPS store pack my stuff for me, paid them and everything. Bought their bubble wrap and box based on their recommendations and paid for the shipping. They STILL broke my stuff even more, including completely damaging my EVGA GTX 285. It was a huge hassle to get money out of them for their mistake, they kept trying to blame me despite the fact they were paid to pack and ship it and I had insured it. That's right! no bubble wrap can save you from UPS, but this is good quality bubble wrap.",5,"Works perfect, fast shipping",1380240000,"09 27, 2013",0.0066

12,A29VG90T649CSU,B00006IBLJ,Sasha Q.,"[1, 1]","Its hard to get excited or wax poetic about bubble wrap. This stuff works good and gets the job done, with no breakages of the things I have wrapped in it. That's about all I can say.",5,works fine,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",0.1426
