0,AK0CENM3LUM28,B00006HPWA,Amazon Customer,"[7, 7]","Printer Paper Avery 3x5 Index Cards / B00006HPWAI bought these for use with my AccuChef recipe program to hold and store recipes, and I'm very happy with them. The paper works flawlessly with my printer (Canon PIXMA MX860 Wireless All-In-One office Printer), and the perforated edges make it easy to detach the cards after printing. The cards can be printed on front and back, which is perfect for large recipes.Do note that you need to fill up all three index cards before detaching them, or else you'll end up wasting the empty ones - my printer, at least, isn't set up to just take in one card - it has to be a full sheet.~ Ana Mardoll",5,Easy Recipe Cards,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",0.4117
1,A2HMF8ZR67BNZS,B00006HPWA,Bill A. Belt,"[0, 0]",My wife needed some cards for recipes and we ordered these since there was a discount on the box. The cards are good quality card stock and we can print three recipe cards per page.With a little work on the computer you can add just about anything you want on the cards and the bakers and cookers will thank you time and time again. By adding some color you can make those plain white cards into a very nice recipe card.,5,Another Great Avery Product,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",0.3887

3,A680RUE1FDO8B,B00006HPWA,Jerry Saperstein,"[11, 14]","I've been a user of 3 x 5 cards for decades. There's always a stack of them in my shirt pocket, though I do admit to not using them consistently.Right now, I'm working on a project that requires me to catalog dozens of snippets from various sources and then integrate them into my writing. Typical outlining programs won't handle this well, so it's back to the index cards. Fortunately, one of my outlining programs handles output to the Avery cards.You can also use them with Microsoft Word, FileMaker, Access and any other program that lets you format your print output.These things tear neatly and accept laser or inkjet output.Brutally expensive when compared to ordinary index cards, but incomparably handy. Worth the price when you need a foolproof method of printing index cards. The regular ones often don't get along with some - actually many - printers.Jerry",5,Computerizing the trusted 3 x 5 card,1236643200,"03 10, 2009",0.2401

5,A3QHDQK0S9JC2M,B00006HPWA,V. Schmidt blue9112,"[0, 0]","I needed to print index cards to keep membership records for a club (of 120 members) and I went to a well-known chain office supply store to pick up a package, which probably would have bee available for the standard cost of $24.50. Of all the AVERY products on the shelves of this story, wouldn't you know - the only item they do not carry is this one. The sales clerk offered to order a package for me but I said NO THANK YOU VERY MUCH - I WILL ORDER MY OWN FROM AMAZON, which I did and saved myself about ten bucks in the process. With the Prime free shipping, I received them in no time, and they are all printed and ready for the membership chairperson to do her thing.The printing went very smoothly. I used the avery label preset for the item number and created a 4-page document for printing, 3 labels per page, and made each page a different color - to conserve my ink supply of any particular color, as well as to keep working with the cards from being boring. I rear loaded my printer (though the cards would probably have fed through the bed just as well but why take chances) and they went through like a charm, no snags. Breaking off the edges and separating the cards was literally a snap. WILL order again.",5,Just what i wanted,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",0.2315
