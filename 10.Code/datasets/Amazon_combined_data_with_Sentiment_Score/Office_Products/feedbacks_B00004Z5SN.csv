These laser labels print well, don't smear, and stick well to envelopes.Why did I give them a 4* review? Because I think this new Easy Peel label is a solution looking for a problem. I've labeled thousands of envelopes (I sell real estate and send out mailers on a regular basis), and I never had a problem with the old style label.These Easy Peel labels have a line where you fold the paper and the edge of the label sticks out making it easier to peel off. When I tried this, the top labels stuck out fine, but the sheet didn't quite fold on the line so the bottom labels didn't stick out as well. I'm not sure that taking the time to fold the sheet 3 times to peel off the labels actually saves any time.I haven't done a major mailer with these labels yet, but I think the regular Avery labels are just as good.",4,Quality labels,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",0.4618

Yes, these are inkjet printers and this is supposed to be a pack of laser labels. Despite that fact, the labels performed very well. Large text and small text are both clear and crisp with minimal ability to smear (not any more than any other paper).In my test with an HP LaserJet 4050, it went through the printer perfectly and the printed labels look terrific.FEATURESThe Pop-up Edge for fast peeling is useful. This is by no means unique, as 3M has the same thing in their labels, but it is useful for quickly pulling labels off. It works by having a perforation strip under the right edge of each label column, so you can fold the sheet and the edge of the label will stick out and be ready to pull off.ADHESIVENESSAs for the adhesiveness, it is a moderate stick -- you can carefully peel it off once you stick it on, but it will not go anywhere if stuck on paper.As you would expect from Avery, these are very high quality labels good for home or office that have stood the test of time.",5,High quality labels you would expect from Avery,1295654400,"01 22, 2011",0.4329

On their web site, Avery give the appearance that they are located in Brea, California, but in reality all of their consumer inquires, information on their products, software support, and general questions are all routed to the Philippines. I was not able to connect with anyone in the USA after more than 30 minutes on the phone with several different people in Manilla.In addition, all of their products are manufactured in either Mexico or China. I am hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with any their products.**************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the Consumer Service Center in Manilla:I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 to help me make the labels. It took some time to download and install, but well worth the time. The wizard was easy to use. Once you down load the software there will be a new toolbar in Microsoft Word. You simply click the Avery button and it gives you a comprehensive list of all of the Avery products (listed by product number). After that is takes you through a few easy-to-understand wizard windows to enter the text and layouts your labels. Once completed, you have a MS-Word document that you can save on your computer and reprint if needed. I was able to make address labels with a small graphic quite quickly and easily.Even though these are listed for use on a Laser printer, I used them on my ink-jet printer and they turned out quite well.

They just work.If you haven't used this type of product, it's a breeze if you have almost any working version of Microsoft Word, because Word has built-in templates for Avery's various labels. Just open or create a document, type in the address you want on the label, select Mailings/Labels (in Word 2007 - varies by version), tell it that you want to use Avery 5260 labels, and Word knows how to lay out the page and to replicate the text 30 times to fill out a page of identical labels. Or you can give Word a list of addresses from a mailing list and it will lay them out to fit on the Avery product.This appears to be a new generation of Avery's line of labels, with pop-up edges to make it easier to peel each label from the page, as compared to older versions which required you to bend the page or pry out each label with your fingernails.

This product doesn't solve both of these, but it sure takes care of one of them! These labels worked flawlessly in our printer, then just bend the backing and the edges of each label are there and ready to be peeled.Cut my labeling time nearly in half!I was a bit concerned that easy peel would mean not sticky, but the labels adhered nicely to the envelopes, with no corner lifting at all.Great product!",4,Super fast for big label jobs,1282089600,"08 18, 2010",0.5011

Is it the right adhesive (does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using)...I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands, but Avery has been making good labels for a long time, so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process!",4,Good solid labels - easy peel feature a good improvement!,1282348800,"08 21, 2010",0.9427

I use the built-in mail merge in Word and it already supports pretty much every label made - including this one (5260.)I've been using Avery labels for over a decade, and this latest generation is a marked improvement. The biggest pain with previous labels was removing the label from the rest of the sheet - you know, the remainder after the labels were removed. These labels don't have that remainder - just the labels. It makes peeling off the labels easier, cleaner and faster.They fed fine on my laser printer and inkjet.People that complain about smudging on the 1st page need to clean the printer more often with a cleaning sheet, or pre-feed heavier stock. Labels are pretty thick! Little fuzzies, pet hair (yes, I have found pet heir in my inkjet print head) and the like may not cause problems with normal paper. But put in card stock, photo paper or labels - you can have a mess. That's why I'll always print a small color block on a piece of card stock BEFORE using labels, or use card stock as the first print as a test. It's a lot cheaper than wasting a sheet of labels!Feeding: I always print test pages. For example my laser printer has three drawers and a manual bypass. One drawer requires the labels be down. Two drawers need them facing up. Manual bypass facing down, and tail-end in first. Envelopes are even more confusing. With paper this is not a concern, with labels it always is.Here's a tip. Take a piece of paper. Use a pen and write TOP on the paper. Flip it over, write BOTTOM. Then draw an arrow on one edge- the edge that goes in the printer first. Print a sheet of labels on this paper. Examine it. Scratch your head. The results are often confusing - but will save you a ton of headaches.",5,"Avery quality, easy to use",1279670400,"07 21, 2010",0.0749

I would suggest searching for the template 5160 instead of trying to look through it to find the correct one. I got the template in a word document format and it was pretty easy to type out.Just a hint, it takes two tabs to get over to the next label to start typing.The confusing part comes from the instructions on the labels. It shows as feed paper only one side. If you have a priner that has the tray on the bottom for loading, I would suggest you turn the sheet around so it prints properly. I accidentally put it the way it told me to and instead, it printed the labels on the back. Furthermore, I used these with a inkjet printer and it worked great as well.So these labels are as described, easy to peel and fairly easy to use.

This new easy peel design couldn't be easier to use. You just bend the column every so slightly and you get an easy to grab edge that allows you to peel off each label without having to grab a corner by nudging with your fingernail, over and over again--even after going through the heat of a laser printer. I have found them to feed through smoothly (only one sheet at a time), not get jammed, not have one of the label corners accidentally adhere to the roller or feed dogs of the printer (yes, this has happened to me and it's a nightmare I'm glad to be able to put behind me). They work like a charm.NOTE TO AVERY:As much as I have loved these labels, I STILL have a slight objection. It has nothing to do with either quality, functionality, or design. It has to do with size. These one-inch high labels easily accommodate a three-line address. A four-line address fits. However, if you want to take full advantage of your word processor's capabilities and add a zip bar code line (which really DOES work in getting your mail delivered faster), you can fit it in on the three-line address, but it gets cut off on the four-line address.If you have a longer address structure, you're absolutely doomed. For example: I have several unmarried couples on my list. They each require a line. (Mr. John Smith, Ms. Mary Jones). I also mail some company executives, and this becomes a nightmare:Mr. John Smith, PresidentThe ACME Company1234 Main Street, Suite 5City, State, Zip//////bar code////////.This address does not fit on a 1 label.This makes creating a large mailing a real problem. I print the whole list (800+) in this label, then discard the ones that didn't fit and re-do them manually on label #05163, which are the next size up but, at 2 x 4 they are really to BIG. (#5962 which is 1 1/3 high doesn't provide that much of an improvement and it's still 4 wide!)Please, Avery, make a 1.5 x 3 label to accommodate the longest names and titles and the longest addresses and not look horrible on the envelope--and make them Easy Peel, just like this one.",5,An improvement over an already good design.,1280534400,"07 31, 2010",0.123

It is so much easier to load a sheet of labels and print a bunch of address labels rather than hand-write the address on each envelope.
