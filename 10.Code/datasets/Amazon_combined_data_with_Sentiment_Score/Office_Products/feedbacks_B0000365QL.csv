It works well, measuring 8 inches by nine inches and about one-eighth of an inch thick. I have washed it once and it looks like it did when it was new... a very nice, if under-appreciated, mouse pad.",5,A very nice mouse pad,1382486400,"10 23, 2013",0.2949
1,A1V4VVBQBFXRHC,B0000365QL,Big-D,"[0, 0]","I wanted a thin full size mouse pad for traveling. Something that is light weight, fits into a carry bag without taking up a bunch of space, I can fold it, roll it up or whatever and this baby fills my needs exactly. Plus, the mouse glides easily. I can also use it to set a hot cup of coffee on it while sitting at someone else's fine desk. Perfect for me.",5,Great Mouse Pad,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",0.2228

4,A28X0LT2100RL1,B0000365QL,Eusebius,"[1, 1]","The pad is sort of OK - it's much smaller and thinner than advertised. I would say this is roughly the equivalent of the 79-cent mouse pads I can get at my local dollar store.The product description says the size is 9x8The technical details say the size is 9.5x8The size shipped to me is actually 9x7.75I guess it's kind of a quibble, but the pad I received is smaller than what was advertised. It's also less than 1/8 thick as well.And, no, I wouldn't buy another.",3,So-so mouse pad,1375833600,"08 7, 2013",0.13

6,A2BBZGVLEGIAVN,B0000365QL,G. Chen what is in a nickname,"[0, 0]","I like this mouse pad a lot. It is a very soft fabric that clings to the table, so my mouse doesn't move around much. It has no visible logos on it. I think that's also nice because I find logos can be really distracting. It is a good value at under $4. I would buy this again. Just attach this add on item to your shopping cart of over $25. I am thinking of getting another one actually.",5,Excellent price for a nice mousepad,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",0.0991

8,A2BPW3FD2JR9ZT,B0000365QL,J. Pak,"[0, 0]",I purchased this mouse pad for playing Starcraft 2 and it works just fine as it provides smooth operation with an Anker Lazer Gaming Mouse. The mouse pad doesn't move around at all on my desk during frantic game playing and is a good size. The price of $2.99 (as an adder) can't be beat even though I'm curious as to how long it will last compared to more expensive ones.,5,Excellent value and works fine,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",0.3008
9,A2J0CYSHN37GA1,B0000365QL,Penviewer,"[0, 0]","I was hesitant to buy this after seeing the mixed reviews, but since it was relatively cheap, I decided to try it out. It came packaged with a stiff cardboard backing, so it was flat and didn't have any curling issues some other mousepads have. People have complained that the mousepad was too thin, but on my desk that is not an issue and I actually like how close to the table it lies as opposed to have a thick slab of a mousepad on my desk. I hold my mouse in a claw grip which means I don't put a lot of weight on it, so I haven't noticed any friction issues, but when I switch over to a palm grip (putting the whole hand on the mouse so it does get heavier) I do notice that there is a noticeable amount of friction between the mouse (amazonbasics 3-button mouse) and the mousepad. I am a tad concerned that the cloth portion might fray off of the mousepad, but only time can tell. After a significant amount of usage I'll post an update.",4,Nice for the price,1371427200,"06 17, 2013",0.0717

You don't hit the edge of the wall on this, and it works great with optical mice. Many thing mouse pads are plastic top and cause issues with optical mice.A good price and works as expected.",5,Thin is in!,1378684800,"09 9, 2013",0.3989

Additionally I found it necessary to click several times to get my computer to react. I had no idea that mouse pads varied in quality, sensitivity and drag.This fellow mouse pad is excellent. The surface lets the mouse move freely with little drag and I am able to control the cursor. The trouble with the sensitivity of the click was cured with a better mouse.I recommend the fellows mouse pad. It meets all my requirements.",5,Works Well,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",0.113

I have knocked off one star because the pad is black and my other black Fellows mouse pads have-- over time-- become dirty with oil and dusk from hands and fingers. You therefore need to wash them frequently. I don't mean to slight a product because of it's color, but this pad should be available in grey or dark grey.",4,Eco-groovy mouse pad,1394064000,"03 6, 2014",0.0813
