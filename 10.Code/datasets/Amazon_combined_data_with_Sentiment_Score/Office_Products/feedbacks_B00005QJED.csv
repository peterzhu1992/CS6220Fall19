The graphics and borders are nice too. Very good value, highly recommended.",5,Wonderful,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",0.3879
1,AQ55H30MZSV0Q,B00005QJED,John A. Lefcourte,"[14, 15]","After getting this I realized a serious lack in Dymo labelers: limited color selection. I'm much less interested in black on red, blue, yellow, green, etc. I need to label black surfaces and want white on clear or on black which Dymo does not make. Brother and Casio do, although both in limited tape sizes. The only other drawback with this labeler is limited type sizes.",4,A Decent Basic Labeler,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",-0.0426
2,AJQDIT55SZ3ZX,B00005QJED,kindred spirit,"[0, 0]",This is a great label maker. It is quality made and the labels look very professional. The refills are not so costly to break the bank. It can do many differnt fonts and also print 2 lines. It was a great deal on the lightening deal day and it's just as great at this great regular price.You will not be disappointed with this item.,5,Best Label Maker I Have Ever Used.,1226534400,"11 13, 2008",0.346

I use it at work, and it easily prints out the labels I type in, and I have had for almost a year, and still going on the same roll ( use it about twice a month for labeling office supplies )",5,Nice label maker!,1250553600,"08 18, 2009",0.3994
4,A37JNUJSVAJKYN,B00005QJED,V. Cummings victorc1978,"[11, 12]","This labeler is simple, it does everything a label gun should! I have labeled so much stuff with this gun, index tabs, to containers - the variable size option, and double line features come in handy so you do not use all your tape up!The price of the refill tape cartridges si pretty cheep compared to others.If you just want a simple labeler that does what is suppose to do and doesn't pretend to be anything else - then get this one!",5,Easy as 1 - 2 - 3,1140566400,"02 22, 2006",-0.0062
