This one is very stiff and the edges get loose string. This is just a piece of mat cut to shape. Nothing special but gets the job done.",3,"Very cheap,Works well",1387324800,"12 18, 2013",-0.0976
1,A2QQKIR0SWZA1,B00004ZAGC,BettyCos,"[0, 0]","This is a simple little mouse pad but works well. My only objection was that I ordered it along with a new keyboard, expecting them to be shipped together. The mouse pad, which cost around $3.00, was shipped separately and $5.00 freight was added, which did not make this purchase cost-effective. Other than that, I have no complaints about the pad itself.",5,Good Value,1298419200,"02 23, 2011",0.1752

4,A3E44U3ZA53NC0,B00004ZAGC,Joel Meek,"[0, 0]","It's cheap and it works, so there isn't a lot I can say about it. It's a bit thinner than some I've had, but it serves the purpose for which it was designed and purchased.",3,Good Mouse Pad,1391126400,"01 31, 2014",0.0
5,A3TA1UJWRJF9NC,B00004ZAGC,jschristian44,"[0, 0]","It has a good size. It has a good surface to track on. It is very, very lightweight though. But it stays down just fine over time.",5,Would buy again,1297728000,"02 15, 2011",0.2942
6,A1XMNRX6G0ZS56,B00004ZAGC,Lee Symphony,"[0, 0]",Great product for the price. Pretty standard mouse pad nothing extraordinary about it other than the price. It works for what it was meant to work for.,4,Great product for the price,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",0.3729
7,AVLSGR94E3ZVE,B00004ZAGC,MommyQ,"[0, 0]","Pros: Smooth surface for the mouse to glide on. Visually appealing. Inexpensive.Cons: No grip on the bottom, so it does occasionally move when my kids are playing with it, but it slides back in place just as easily.Overall, We've had this a few months and I'm happy with this purchase. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a basic mouse pad to replace a cracked or outdated one.",5,Modern,1398643200,"04 28, 2014",0.2666
8,A2AB67XEWZYJ5Z,B00004ZAGC,M. T.,"[0, 0]","Not as nice as I expected, but I was tired of having my mouse directly on my desk. This solved the problem, but don't expect anything fancy. Rather than the cloth/rubber I expected, it seemed to be made out of cheap foam. Some free mouse pads may be better than this one, but it is certainly better than nothing.",3,You get what you pay for,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",0.0318
9,A1CMD08Z49PGKQ,B00004ZAGC,okiedan Pro Bono Publico,"[0, 0]",These belkin mouse pads are cheap and effective. They are worth your consideration when you need a small pad for your mouse.,5,Good basic pad,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",0.3515
10,AJC7WTO025631,B00004ZAGC,ProShopper,"[0, 0]",These should all be .89 cents regardless of color but it changes often. Just dont get them wet or the glue will come loose and the fabric will fall off. Not worth more than .89 cents so get any color that is cheaper.,3,These became cheaper than the blue ones for now,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",-0.1626
11,A2CGL6SJXR0A2D,B00004ZAGC,Scott B,"[0, 0]","Yeah, it's a mouse pad, but the top surface is poorly attached and curled up very quickly. Better to have one that's all one piece.",2,Cheap,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",0.4309
12,AKK6JKYM86PAQ,B00004ZAGC,Timothy Doctor,"[0, 0]","This is a simple, yet needed item, so I was thrilled to find such a good price. If you use a computer, eventually you go through these as they get dirty or frayed around the edges.",4,Good Buy...,1396483200,"04 3, 2014",0.1417
