0,A28ZDVY6NV75P,B00004Z4BV,AZ Desert Rat movie buff,"[3, 3]",I put up a solar light on my brick fence wall in the back yard using this tape. It really holds well and the light as not budged. Saved me from having to drill holes in the wall. Highly recommend.,5,Strong stuff,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",0.2942
1,A1R3GN9MEJFXM3,B00004Z4BV,I'm not an internet shopaholic - thebanker,"[0, 0]",I have these same 3M mounting tapes each with different mounting weight. Used them for many reasons for many years and have not failed me.,5,3M tape that works for multiple applications,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",0.2011
2,A1KCEFHPULW0OU,B00004Z4BV,Jason,"[0, 0]",I bought this thinking it was like the 3M stuff I bought in the past; clear and very sticky. This tape is a gray color and is not as sticky. I'm not sure what model tape the clear stuff was but it was great. This tape is still good but not quite as strong as I would like. I bought several rolls to hang some reflective barrier on my garage door. So far it is holding up well with the heat.,4,good tape,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",0.2743

It is stupid strong (not sure what stupid strong is, but it sounds good) and it's not coming off once you put it on.",5,It is stupid strong (not sure what stupid strong is,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",0.3737

7,A33ZYFE8XMKKR1,B00004Z4BV,P. Scott Pope Scott Pope,"[0, 0]","This tape is great for hardware projects requiring a high strength but potentially temporary bond. I have often used it for building mechanical and electrical gadgets as well as for repairs on household items. It has worked well on both flat and irregular surfaces. I would highly recommend the Scotch exterior mounting tape over the foam-based tapes for any project -- indoor or outside as it holds up better under repeated mechanical stress.In one example, I used this tape to affix several one pound lead weights to flight simulator rudder pedals that were ultimately removed. The removal was an arduous process. I found that using a Weller heat gun and hand scraper was the best method. If you are using this mounting tape in situation where it may need to be removed, you might was to check the durability of the surface first as any paint/finish could be damaged.",5,Great High Strength Double Sided Mounting Tape,1320451200,"11 5, 2011",0.297
8,A36XG2H1S14FW,B00004Z4BV,Richie,"[0, 0]","This is the best mounting tape I have ever used and I swear by it! If I want something to stick on then I will use this tape. This is the gorilla tape of double sided tapes. Perfect, and will adhere to almost any surface you can find, and rather permanently if it is smooth.",5,Greatest and strongest mouinting tape I have ever had,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",0.3242

10,A30UP2KKD5IQEP,B00004Z4BV,Soar,"[5, 6]","Here is a re-post of my review for the same product but for 450 roll instead of this 60 roll. I recommend the 450 roll because at the current price, the 450 roll is 3 times the price of this 60 roll and you get 7.5 times the length of material. A much better value, and if you like it as much as I do... YOU WILL WANT IT.Scotch Permanent Outdoor Mounting Tape, 1 Inch x 450 Inches (4011-LONG)I call this sticky tape stuff because when I started using it, I found it to be less a double-sided mounting tape and more like a thin sheet of sticky gum. This stuff stretches out to much longer and narrower or can be folded upon itself to be thicker. Sticky stuff.Value:This 450 inch roll is the much better value than the 60 inch roll on the site (4 cents per inch versus 10 cents per inch).Does it work:I haven't found any type of mounting or double sided tape that comes anywhere near this in sticking ability. I use this in my garage to mount some padded rubber surfaces (very light) to a cinder block wall to protect my car doors, through extreme heat and cold, the surface has stuck. I use this to mount a plastic device that attaches hoses to a window (for an in-room AC unit) which gets a significant amount of torque from the heavy hoses, absolutely no issue. So, yes, it works.That's it... if you are a do-it-yourself'er, this is a must have for your tool kit.",5,Fantastic Product - buy bigger roll though,1323475200,"12 10, 2011",0.2407
11,A2HRHF83I3NDGT,B00004Z4BV,WiseShopper,"[0, 0]",These are faily strong outdoor tape. I bought this to hang a sign outside my door and after over a year the sign is still there hanging on to concrete. Good price too.,5,good.,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",0.317
