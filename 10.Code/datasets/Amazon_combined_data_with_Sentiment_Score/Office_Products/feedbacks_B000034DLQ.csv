When it is warmed up, it beeps and a light comes on. You are now ready to laminate your cards. This little machine is durable, user friendly, and super easy! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a quality machine for a decent price.",5,User friendly / Easy to use!!,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",0.4874

3,AZ8XSDMIX04VJ,B000034DLQ,Lee 07 Dyna Low Rider,"[6, 6]","I love this little unit. Slim, trim,portable quiet and does the job fast and effectively. I've been laminating EVERYTHING and then some. Laminated proof of insurance certificate, Registrations for cars, boats, motorcycles and waverunners, Medication List & Physicians List cards ( I typed a list of our medications and our doctors names and phone on a business card so I have it handy in case of emergency or filling out forms) Old photos, ID cards, newspaper clippings, prayer cards ( the ones you get from funerals), anything that would be beneficial to protect, I laminated. It takes just SECONDS to do, and it comes out perfectly every time. Just picked up more business size laminating pouches from my local office supply, and I'm ready for more!",5,Great & a Handy Unit to own,1279929600,"07 24, 2010",0.3685
