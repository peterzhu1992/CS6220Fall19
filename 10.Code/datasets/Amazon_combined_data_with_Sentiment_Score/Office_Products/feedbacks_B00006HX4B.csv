However, what you don't hear enough of is praise for their performance. So, I'll just say it: Avery labels perform better than the compettion. They adhere better, they're thicker, they block out what is underneath better, and they don't peel of the backing and ruin your expensive office printer. Quite simply, for laser or injet labels, Avery is the clear winner in quality and performance. You get what you pay for.",5,"High Quality, High Performance Labels",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",0.1804
1,A4IL0CLL27Q33,B00006HX4B,D. Brennan,"[6, 6]","I use these as labels for bottles. It is the perfect size for labeling 12.7 ounce bottles. The positive points are:1 - They do not jam, bend or otherwise get messed up during the printing cycle.2 - They peel easily from the sheet, but stick VERY firmly to glass.3 - They are thick enough so that they can be applied to bottles smoothly with no wrinkles. This is a HUGE advantage over some other types of labels we have tried.4 - The 5264 template is built in to most major software packages. Setting up the labels for printing was a breeze.The negatives are: Haven't found any yet!One reviewer mentioned that he had problems removing labels once they were applied to bottles. First, that's generally a good thing. The last thing I would want to happen is to have the labels just slide off after getting wet or being subjected to temperature changes. However I tried removing labels for the first time last week and didn't really find it all that hard. What I did was rinse the bottles with hot running water for a couple of minutes. I then places the bottles in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes. The labels peeled right off for the most part. In a couple of cases there was a bit of adhesive left on bottles, but that rubbed off easily enough while the bottle was still hot.My wife actually then used a bit of an environmentally friendly degreaser on a bottle that was not boiled, and that seemed to remove the adhesive easily enough as well.I highly recommend this product.",5,Perfect for bottle labels,1277078400,"06 21, 2010",0.1627
2,A2U1GR2QY28DJ6,B00006HX4B,J. Zhang,"[0, 0]","it is expensive, cost about 50%-100% more than a no name.But is worth it if you need something really good. Printing has not jammed so far. Stickers have not fall yet.My previous one jams for wvery 20 or so pages. Also fall from plastic bags after a few days (I might be not comparing apples to apples, as the previous labels has a smaller size. I have to use the labes between two plastic bags and let the outer places a little pressure on them.Applying on papers, no difference.",4,quite good,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",-0.018
3,A3O8N35W0F6ZP7,B00006HX4B,Kan,"[0, 0]",They have done excellent job of shipping. It came right even before they said and we are on two opposite coasts in USA. Good job of packing and shipping. My only complain is they said when I looked last time that I bought the last of this label. If they continue the way they have done for me. They will have my business. See price is everything. I have been using these labels for years so I do know if they are good or not. I know they are. I know they come in two forms one is high gloss other is not. Not sure which one I got it is not at home.,5,Avery 5168,1361318400,"02 20, 2013",0.0773
