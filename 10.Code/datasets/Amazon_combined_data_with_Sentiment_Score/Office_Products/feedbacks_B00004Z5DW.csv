0,A2F6DKMQYMI7F7,B00004Z5DW,Amazon Customer Mom of 7,"[0, 0]",Good mouse pad. Mouse glides easily. Was bent when it arrived but has finally straightened out. I don't really like the thin plastic top but it works fine.,4,Good mouse pad!,1352246400,"11 7, 2012",0.2539
1,A220R3YGCKPTBH,B00004Z5DW,Anthony Stevens,"[0, 0]","This mousepad has a plasticky surface and the mouse glides smoothly and accurately. Definitely recommend. For the price, this one can't be beat. I also tried the 3m mousepad which costs more but performs the same as this one.",5,good for optical mice,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",0.1592
2,A2H4GCOBMYKIZE,B00004Z5DW,J.F. LEWIS,"[0, 0]",You would think that if you have saw one basic mouse pad you have saw them all. However I think this product could be better. After comparing to another mouse pad that is of slightly higher quality and price I find I will more than likely opt for the other unit in the future.,3,"Basic mouse pad, perfect for basic use.",1404777600,"07 8, 2014",0.1468
3,A198CCH4NNLI2E,B00004Z5DW,Jonathan Birge,"[3, 3]","It is indeed blue, flat and provides a stable horizontal surface for a mouse. All for less than $2 and without having to suffer the indignity of going inside an Office Depot or Staples. For that reason alone, it would be a bargain at twice the price.",5,What a deal,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",0.2251

5,A22M9VM8S9YCZ6,B00004Z5DW,Mr. Fife,"[0, 0]",This is a basic mouse pad. It has no bells and whistles. It functions perfectly and I would buy it again.,5,Decent Mouse Pad,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",0.1136
6,A11YOTONCPRQ9S,B00004Z5DW,P.L.,"[1, 1]","I ordered 2 premium mousepads. Amazon sent 1 premium and one 65 cent standard blue.The premium one makes my new-ish Logitech optical mouse skip, hang, lag. It does work on my 15 year old Microsoft Explorer optical mouse.Also, the edges are so sharp I feel like I'm going to slit my wrist on it.Would not recommend.",1,Does not work with Logitech mouse,1374710400,"07 25, 2013",-0.0259
7,A2CH2HX82W1KYM,B00004Z5DW,Safet Berisa,"[0, 0]","It's light, cheap and it gets the job done. I use it with my Logitech M510 mouse and it works great. So much that I've ordered two--one for the home, one for the office and my girlfriend got one as well.",5,Great mouse pad,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",0.2994
8,A22PER4P3LP2PU,B00004Z5DW,Sir Lion,"[0, 0]","I couldn't decide which mouse pad to buy and this one was so cheap, I bought this Belkin one along with this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017D5Z40After testing them both, Belkin might be cheaper but its thick and doesn't track as well for laser/optical.Go Belkin if you still use a trackball. Otherwise spend a few more dollars for the thinner better mouse pad.",3,Great price but for a few dollars more you can get better quality.,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",0.0698
9,A3IMK08UX0I46A,B00004Z5DW,TOPJOB7 topjob7,"[0, 0]","How bad can a mouse pad be? That's what I thought....First, be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad. Basically, it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32 foam pad. Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads, but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides, and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad isn't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it. It is very distracting.Finally, the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it. VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles, so 2 stars.",2,Terrible! Here's the problems....,1393286400,"02 25, 2014",-0.1204
