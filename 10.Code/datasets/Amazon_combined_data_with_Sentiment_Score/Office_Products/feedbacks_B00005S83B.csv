0,A3T4OHEAHOJ700,B00005S83B,B. Colonna,"[34, 37]","My order came from 'The Witz and Sons', fulfilled by Amazon.I've bought HP ink through Amazon for years and never once had an issue. This time what I received was questionable.The product is advertised as being in retail packaging, and the photo shows an HP package.However, when I opened the Amazon box, what was inside was not in an HP retail box. Instead the ink cartridge arrived unboxed. There was no HP cardboard box. It arrived in only the HP inner foil package. That means there was NO HP box, NO UPC and, of course, NO explicit expiration date listed.The only thing on the package, outside of the HP logo, is a foil code. In my case the foil code is SG2 110800 100218 1133. I happen to be familiar with the codes on HP foil, so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format, I was able to see that what I was sent had an ink warranty that expired about 9 months ago back in August 2011 (110800), and was produced in February of 2010 (100218).While many people use ink past the warranty date, that should be the choice of the consumer. Here, it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a old product as fresh, which is deceitful, at best.",1,Read The Fine Print !,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",0.0167
