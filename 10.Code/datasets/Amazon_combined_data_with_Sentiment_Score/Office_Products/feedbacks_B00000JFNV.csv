9,A55PCTJ6NINET,B00000JFNV,David K. Watson DKW,"[1, 1]","This product consists of decent quality 8.5 x 11 matte card stock with a partial laser perforation in the middle so the it folds in half evenly. 25 envelopes are included in the package. This is larger than a typical greeting card, but the size makes it easy to use with just about any printer. The paper accepts and absorbs the ink without seeping through or veining in the paper fibers. The paper color is not bright white, but is appropriate for a greeting card.The package insert, dated 2007, states that Avery DesignPro software is Windows only. However, Avery DesignPro for Mac OSX is now available as a free download on the Avery.com software page. Avery DesignPro for Mac is a basic graphic design and layout program which includes templates for most Avery products, including Avery/American Greetings Half Fold Blank Cards (3265). This is the easiest way I know of to use this kind of product. In addition, Avery DesignPro includes a printer calibration feature. Absolute precision is not so critical on greeting cards, but if you're printing 90-per-page return address labels, a fraction of an inch one way or the other can run a whole sheet of labels.My printer (an HP 7180) has a duplex (two-sided printing) attachment. The DesignPro software will print both sides on the same job. The trick is to choose Short-edge Binding in the print dialog box. If you choose long-edge, the inside of the card will print upside down on the wrong page. The preview in the print dialog box does not show the inside page, but it does print. If your printer does not have a duplex attachment, then you simply print page 1 only, flip the paper over and then print page 2 only. I'd suggest trying this once or twice with plain paper, so you know exactly how to flip the paper for your particular printer.To me, these products fall in the etiquette scale between a hand-written note on your personal letterhead and a greeting card you bought in the grocery store. They do show you put some time and effort into the communication.",5,Good product - Usable with Mac OSX,1289174400,"11 8, 2010",0.2103

It is 8.5x11-in. card stock for inkjet printers, with a crease in the middle for folding. It has a template number for use with word-processing and creative-project software, but templates can often be more trouble than they are worth, especially for the simple task of dividing a simple letter-sized sheet into two parts. There is a convenience, to be sure, in having correct-sized envelopes packaged with the paper; but again, there is nothing special about this size of envelope; and they feel somewhat flimsy, not exactly something in which to encase the results of your artistic labors.Plain is OK, but to get a top rating from me this product would have needed to have been special in some way, such as perhaps being glossy on half of one side in order to provide a space in which to print a photo vibrantly.",3,Convenient but boring,1288656000,"11 2, 2010",-0.0282

The template I downloaded did not have any envelope printing option; there was only a template for the card. Designing the card took a little bit of experimenting before I got the writing and picture to be organized correctly in the template. There are really no guides in the template. It also took me a while to orient the paper correctly in the printer, but once that worked, the output of the picture on the card cover was rich.This is for inkjet printers only and before I selected this product, I had missed that description. I did try it in my laser printer with the duplex option set and the card stock got jammed as expected. However, it did print the front of the card beautifully before that happened. I then printed a saying on regular paper and glued it to the back of the card. Obviously, if you have an inkjet printer, you won't have to do this. Instead, I had my friend use this product on her inkjet printer. Below is her review:The paper has the perfect weight for card stock. The paper fed through my printer with ease each time (not too thick), and it worked well for double sided printing with no bleed through. Both black and color ink printed perfectly.

In the past, I have had greeting card papers jam or refuse to feed unless the paper goes in from the top, but I had no difficulties with either printer in this case. The colors were a bit richer coming from the Epson printer, and I'm sure it's because that printer utilizes six ink cartridges and is designed more specifically for photo printing. However, the results were very close, and I was very happy with the prints from both machines. Colors are bright and clear, and the details are sharp. The cards have a nice feel to them and the scoring in the middle of the sheets make them very easy to fold cleanly and evenly.

Avery White Half-Fold Greeting Cards are nice to have to quickly and easily create a nice looking card. The paper is sturdier and nicer looking than normal printer paper. I think at a half page size, they are a little big and the envelopes are a little cheap looking. My huge recommendation is to always print your card on a piece of normal paper to make sure it is right before using this paper. Since I messed one up, I printed a half page size card. I like that size better, but then you need to have your own envelopes or do without. Making two per page would make the cards more economical, too. It is very easy to find pre-made designs that fit this template size. Even a beginner could make a card in minutes.

I assumed that the same card (same pictures, words and fonts) would look about the same on them both. After all, they were both Avery products. To test my theory, I test-printed the same thing (using the same fonts and the same picture) on both cards. I was amazed at the difference! The words were sharper and clearer on these cards. However, where they really stood out was the clarity of the picture! The picture on the other card was acceptable -- until I put them side-by-side for comparison! On this card, the colors were more vivid, and the picture was a lot sharper. In fact, when compared to this card-stock, the picture on the less expensive paper looked faded and washed out (something I probably would've never noticed if I hadn't seen the side-by-side comparison). I'm still having a hard time believing that different card-stock can make such a diffence. The difference really is that noticeable.

Mostly, I have made them onCanon Matte Photo Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches, 50 Sheets (7981A004). (Note, however, I have not bought this paper since 2005, when I stocked up on it, because it was so cheap. Thus, I don't know if Canon has changed anything about the paper or not. The box itself looks different.) It is basically inexpensive photo paper, and has no Canon name on the reverse side, so you can print your greetings on that side. (Just make certain you print the photo on the right side. If not, it will look horrendous, whereas words look just fine. Hold the paper up to a lamp to find the brightest white side for the photo.) It also folds relatively easily. If you want your card on glossy paper, use glossy photo paper for your photograph, pastel or bright bonded paper for your message, and tape or paste the bonded paper to the back of the glossy paper. (All glossy paper I have ever seen has the brand's name on the back, so messages can't be printed there.) Then, just get a box of envelopes that fit your cards, such asColumbian CO468 Grip-Seal Invitation Envelopes A9, 5-3/4 x 8-3/4 - White (Box of 100).If you want it quick and easy, though, do get these Avery greeting cards. The envelopes are included, and the card paper is already half folded, so there's no struggle in getting the card folded just right. The photos I printed on these cards looked almost as good as the photos printed on matte photo paper. I used 10 of these Avery cards to make a stationery set for friends. I printed photos of their dogs on the front of the cards, and left the insides blank for newsy notes. Since the envelopes in this pack come bounded in two sets of ten, that worked out quite well. I included one of the envelope sets with the cards, and had a very nice Christmas gift for my friends. I don't think the included envelopes are quite as nice as the Columbian ones, but they certainly will do. Also, when making a quarter card, while folding the half card in half, the card tore in half! So, you might want to watch out for that, or get quarter card paper for your smaller cards. Making greeting cards on the computer is lots of fun, and Avery makes it simple with these half-fold greeting cards!",5,Photos Look Great On These Cards . . . .,1294272000,"01 6, 2011",0.309
40,A2I4A4WGWII18Z,B00000JFNV,Sunny Sewing Honeybee,"[0, 0]","I am on my third pack of Avery half-fold cards in only about a year's time. I love this product! Aside from the typical print-out greeting cards, I use the cardstock for a couple of other things as well: (1) They're scored deeply enough that they rip in half easily. Once ripped in half, I cut along the line to make it look neater, fold each half of cardstock in half, and then make two handmade cards out of one sheet. (2) The cardstock works really well as a cover when creating half-fold booklet projects.One thing that's different about this product from others is that it comes with envelopes. Plenty of other brands only sell cardstock in packs, and this envelope size isn't always easy to find. The printing is also less likely to smear than some other types of heavy paper since the surface isn't glossy.The only negative I have to say is that this packet used to come with 25 cards and envelopes (my old box reads: 5 more cards! Now with 25 cards.). I really wish Avery had kept the pack at a larger size and not taken it back down to 20. The actual product is great, though, and something I use frequently.",5,Great product; wish it still came with more,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",0.2931
41,AD1ZOPB0BBEHB,B00000JFNV,Suz,"[0, 0]","These cards allow us to make beautiful, personalized custom cards at a fraction of what we'd pay for those overpriced, impersonal store-bought ones. I can have 25 hand drawn Avery cards for less than the price of one fancy store-bought one, or if I print them, including ink, it would still be less than $1/card.The kids used the Avery cards for the first time today, making some cards for a friend's birthday. They came out looking so nice and polished. We didn't even bother with the printer; they just drew right on them. They will have even more fun when we've got more time to experiment, with glitter, buttons, stickers, cut outs, etc. I'm looking forward to scanning in some of their favorite drawings and using them for cover art. Or making a Father's Day card with a photo of the kids and their dad. I think I'll make a birthday card for my dad from his dog, with a picture of his dog on the cover and googly eyes pasted on.The card stock is nice and heavy, is a nice bright white that shows true colors, and is scored for easy folding. The folds come out crisp but not at all flimsy.Knowing Avery products as I do, I'm sure they will work like a dream in my printer, but I will update my review when I have an opportunity to do a card on the printer.",5,A money-saving staple from now on,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",0.493
42,AZBXKUH4AIW3X,B00000JFNV,Thomas Jefferson Independence Forever,"[0, 0]",These greeting cards worked really good. I was looking for a card size more like the ones you buy in the store but these were inexpensive and you get 20 of them. Good deal. I Payed the price I would pay for one Hallmark card and got 20 of them. This is fun for the whole family both making and receiving them.,4,Worked Well,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",0.3547

I chose cute Christmas card design, my photo and my personal message and was done in minutes! But... I didn't like starting with just blank cards. For advanced users I'm sure it's what everybody wants, blank slate so their imagination runs wild. But I wanted to at least start with some color and pre-printed borders, so all I would need to pick is my pictures and write my message. Overall, still 5 out of 5.",5,Fanstatic for card designers! ... but for newby like me it was tough to start with plain white paper,1294012800,"01 3, 2011",0.2373
