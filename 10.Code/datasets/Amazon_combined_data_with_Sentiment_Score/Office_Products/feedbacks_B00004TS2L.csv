However, laying down that much ink on the paper made the paper crinkle somewhat from all the liquid.",4,Works well once you have the correct printer settings,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",0.3825
3,ASFP250F22MDZ,B00004TS2L,But I'm feeling much better now...,"[3, 4]","I bought this as an alternative to high priced Canon 13X19 matte paper. I do a lot of small signs/posters and the paper cost of the Canon stuff was getting prohibitive. The quality of this paper is OK, heavier than standard paper, and with a smooth finish to make inkjet printing look good. The thing is, I cut down the price per piece, by also using a lot of white space, from over $2 apiece to about .50, without any real loss of impact.Do not attempt to print photos on this paper, saturated business graphics look good, your vacation shots will not.For the price, give it a try for graphics.",5,Posters yes - Photos no.,1270080000,"04 1, 2010",0.2136
4,A1AQYAGTO2O43P,B00004TS2L,Dave,"[0, 0]","I was very happy with this paper.My only issue is you have to be smart enough (which I wasn't ) to figure out which side to print on. One side is white, the other is off-white. If you print on the wrong side it doesn't come out well.",5,Good Paper. Good Price.,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",0.0567

6,A1N10E26UAQ2TF,B00004TS2L,Matthew,"[1, 1]",I am using a Pro 9000 Mark II and this paper is wonderful for presenting projects that do not require photo paper. I would recommend this to any graphic designer looking to minimize their footprint while not sacrificing the quality of their work. Beautiful prints on plain paper setting with high clarity.Make sure you see which side of the paper you are printing on. It will make a difference in the outcome as this is a one sided presentation paper. The other side has a yellowish tint to it!,5,Great clarity for thin paper,1362873600,"03 10, 2013",0.3336
7,ARX0KOX5Q01BJ,B00004TS2L,Mike J. Cianciosi Mike,"[0, 0]",I use it before printing a photo for a proof. And also to make shooting targets. It prints crystal clear. The price was right. I keep it around for stock for my shop too.,5,great paper,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",0.0764
8,A3RFNCMOL3FSE8,B00004TS2L,MLouise,"[2, 2]","This is great for my purposes. I wanted paper that was lighter weight than the heavier matte papers, but I still wanted my photos to be crisp and vibrant. I am doing fliers with photos, and this paper is absolutely perfect! This is the Presentation Paper, Matte, and it prints EXACTLY like the 'Premium' (heavyweight) version. I have both versions, and I love both, but sometimes I don't want or need the weight or expense of the heavier papers. This one is 27 lb, the premium version is 44 lb. Both are great quality, and prints look exactly the same on both. The only difference is the weight.One final note, these are NOT for two sided printing. The back side is a darker shade, and does not have the smooth finish. If you print on the back by mistake it will not turn out well. If I'm working in dim lighting I need to hold a back against a front so I can tell the difference for when I load my printer.",5,Perfect Clarity on Fairly Light Paper,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",0.2503
