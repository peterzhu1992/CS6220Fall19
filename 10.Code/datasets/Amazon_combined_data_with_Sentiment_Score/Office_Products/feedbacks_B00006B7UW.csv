Unfortunately, it came in today when I needed to type a bunch from some papers so I set it up in front of my iMac. It fits between the screen and the keyboard perfectly and the tilt is adjustable so I can place it just under the screen view. I also like the elastic line guide, which I found useful in keeping my place on the pages.First, it's great and I again I find myself asking why I don't own more 3M stock. I will get the kids another one because I'm keeping this longer format one for me. It allows me to place a book or 2 sheets of paper (I can just about squeeze in a 3rd) across the clear, flat plastic surface and easily see what I am looking at, which is a way more comfortable feat for these 50 year old eyes. Surprisingly, the clear surface appears to be high grade optical plastic and does not distort images underneath. It's a marked improvement over those flimsy aluminum or plastic typewriter paper trays from earlier years.Second, it rates only a pretty good and not an Ah, ha from those 3M engineers. I guess it cannot be helped that the stand eats up a foot of prime desk space. This is unhelpful when its use is not necessary. The design suggests it is kind of meant to be semi-permanently fixed: The feet are study with substantial weight to hold heavier papers and such which is good. BUT, I'm going to have to be very careful--where the feet attach to the plastic surface is flimsy, not reinforced and bond to break if occasionally moved. I guess that is why the assembly instructions tell you it takes only 30 seconds to attach the base to the feet rather than provide better detail on how to attach. So be warned, this is a handy, very useful product; but, unless you use it continually, you will need to assemble and disassemble the parts to move it to and from your desk. I'm keeping the packaging box for storage. At least it has a 5 year warrantee which I bet will be much used, 3M.And I'm still buying another one for the kids; I'll probably break down again and get the wider format.

However, it takes up quite a bit of space on your desk, and barely leaves space for anything else. If you're not using it you will probably want to fold it and put it away, but then bringing out the heavy stand each time can be time consuming. So unless you do a lot of copying of books etc., it will not be used as much. I really don't find it very useful in the kitchen like some others, as I hardly ever cook from cook-books. And when I do once in a while I'll just leave a cook book open on the counter in a clear plastic bag, rather than use this stand as it takes up a lot of space and is not meant to be moved around a lot.I found it to be a nice way to hold 2 side-by-side information sheets at a booth or on a counter top in a store.

5,AOEP96629WHHA,B00006B7UW,A. Reid,"[0, 1]","3M is a good company. I trust the quality of their products and generally regard them as good value, but I have to admit to being a bit disappointed in this design. This copy holder has good capacity and very solidly constructed legs. But the large piece of clear plastic at its core feels flimsy for the scale of the item, and at a manufacturer retail price of $109, I'd expect more solidity. I'm afraid to tighten the legs too much for fear of cracking the plastic.Another potential drawback to the item, depending on your set up, is its size. To hold 300 sheets, it has to be big, and it is. It claims to be Designed to position directly between monitor and keyboard just below monitor. If your desk (like mine) has a pull out drawer for your keyboard, you're not going to be able to put this below the monitor. You need 4 for the feet. You'll have to put it in front of or to the side of the monitor, presuming you have 4 of depth and 11 of width to play with. (Fortunately for me, I do.)Those concerns aside, the unit seems to work as billed. I've tried this out with single sheets of paper, stacks of paper and books, and it has performed well for me with all of them. The ledge is pretty deep (notThe Riverside Shakespearedeep, but deep enough for most texts), and it is ridged to help hold content in place--a nice supplement to the rubber band that spans across the text. It is flexible in angle. In addition to holding text at the computer, it can easily serve in other capacities where you need books or papers held. It could be of good use in the kitchen holding recipes, at your child's desk helping hold a book for homework, at a side table holding instructions for a hobbyist.At $109, though, it's a luxury. I think it's a luxury even at the ~$60 Amazon is currently asking, but, as with all such items, it comes down to how badly you want it and how much you have to spend. To give it its due, for its capacity the reduced price seems to be if not a bargain, at least compatible with the expense of similar devices from other companies...and, with those solid legs, it looks like a good step forward in quality.",3,"Good idea; perhaps not good value.

Also slips down when you have heavier book on the stand.Thought I must have them attached wrong, but they are correct.Maybe some masking tape under the clamps might close the gaps a bit and make it tighten up better.I would suggest that you never move it around with the legs attached as there is only a very small lip of plastic on the clear back board to keep it all together and when that snaps you will not be able to use that area again.Plastic legs are make heavy by filling them with steel shot or BBs through a hold in the bottom and then sealed with a plastic plug pushed in then covered with one of the stick on foam feet.This could be a pretty nice item with the use of a bit of metal in the right places rather than plastic IMO.",3,Expected better ... at the MSRP,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",0.8847

10,AXAJXJZUL2J5P,B00006B7UW,D. Scott,"[0, 1]","My first thought upon opening the box for this 3M Copy Holder was, $109 retail? Really? Even Amazon's considerably lower price seems way out of line for what this is. My complaints:* As another reviewer has noted, the weighted legs are filled with metal balls that are sealed in only by rubber pads that double as non-skid feet. Over time, those pads are likely to peel up or slowly shift out of place (as rubber protective feet tend to do), resulting in pellets spilling out all over the place. It is inconceivable to me that 3M didn't seal up the legs better. This is one of those head-scratching what-were-they-thinking design flaws you especially hate to see in such an expensive product.* The rubber band that holds books open is supposed to double as a place keeper. It's unlikely anyone would use it thusly very often (unless, perhaps, if leaving their desk for an extended period of time) because each side has to be adjusted separately.* All of the parts seem rather flimsy. I was afraid of cracking something even while I was snapping it together. If you do break anything, the holder is ruined.* Some people will take this thing out of the box and intuitively snap everything on, but I'm not among them. The instructions consist of a few black-and-white line drawings that I found wholly unhelpful. I eventually got it together (by looking at the photo on the front of the instruction pamphlet), but I was a bit frustrated by the experience. They definitely could have provided better instructions.* This thing is *huge*. It takes up a lot of space on the desk, and it's slightly cumbersome to fold up for storage. Because it is shipped disassembled, if you want to use the box it comes in for storage, you will have to disassemble the holder. As much as this thing costs, a cheap case (to keep the legs from flopping around and to give it some protection) would have been a nice touch.So who would need this thing? Well, if you need to refer extensively to a book (especially a large, heavy reference book) while typing, this is a good product for that. If you only need to refer to paper documents, I think one of the many other, less-expensive document holders 3M offers would do as good of a job for a whole lot less, such as the cheap and space-saving3M Document Clipor their3M Desktop Copy Holder. I thought this souped-up mega version might make a pretty good cookbook holder, but Amazon has a lot of purpose-built products that cost a lot less and would probably function better (for example, the inexpensiveNorpro Acrylic Cookbook Holderor the highly ratedClear Solutions Jumbo Cookbook Holder).Overall, I really can't recommend this 3M Copy Holder.

12,A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL,B00006B7UW,fatmav,"[1, 1]","On paper this copy holder is a great idea, and with the 3M brand you know it is a quality product. This copy holder helps you keep a book in a slanted upright position so that you can refer to it easily. Thanks to the extra heavy base, it can really be any book, including a dictionary. The elastic band keeps the book open and can serve as a line guide. So what's not to like?It turns out that in everyday use, I start to grow tired of it. First it is the size. 18 inch is REALLY big, which is great if you need to hold a book open or have two sheets of letter-sized paper side-by-side. But when the holder is empty, it's really quite noticeable if left in front of the monitor. Fine, I will remove it when empty. But the base is heavy, and the holder is not easily collapsible. (Both of these are in fact PROS in my mind.)There are a CONS. The elastic band that holds the book open is not easily adjustable if you only want to use one hand. It also seems that this elastic band is the weakest component and will surely break the earliest. But it's hard to tell how long it will hold.Overall, I would say that this is great if you need an industrial grade copy holder on a regular basis, with regular being the keyword here.",5,"Great idea with good execution, but make sure you really want it first",1288051200,"10 26, 2010",0.1445

Basically you just need to open the dials on the base parts so you can fit the clear plastic part in. It is easier if you figure out the approximate tilt and height you will need for the clear plastic part that supports your written materials before you tighten up the sides but it is fairly amenable to change. If you are even a little fanatical about all things being exactly even, it will cause you to get out a spirit level because otherwise you will fuss at it for awhile.I work from home and use a variety of research books, some of which are quite large well over the 300 page limit of this page holder; however, if the book fits in the bottom lip, the holder will support it. I have a roll top desk so by using a variety of heights and drawers, I am able to keep three laptops working at the same time, as well as having four to five research books open. This opened a whole new level for me in a space that was largely wasted.I really liked the way I was able to get this to drop an open book at sight level between the top shelf and the desktop surface of my desk. It created a level 1 which is incredibly useful.This is also sturdy. I have several bookholders, one even fashioned by a metal working friend who noticed that I needed something sturdier for some of my books while she was in my office. The only advantage over those are that I am able to use clips to hold books open as well as magnets to keep notes in place. The base on this is able to keep the entire unit as stable as the metal book holders but obviously not hold notes with magnets. Not a serious problem although I expect I will be using clips on it shortly enough.There are two flaws that bother me. The clear plastic itself: it's like waiting for a ding on a new car. You want to get it over with so you can go back to being free and easy. Yes, I'm still waiting for the first scratch so I don't have to be careful anymore. Understandably this is a strength and a flaw. The other is that even when I am using books under 300 pages, one side of the base pieces sometimes tilts. If it comes down, everything on my desk comes down with it. If the bases were a little heavier, that would make it an even better product.",4,Adds a new study level,1289692800,"11 14, 2010",0.3954

My favorite copy holder ever was a little bar that stuck on a CRT monitor and could be folded back against the side of the monitor to move it out of the way when not being used and held it at the perfect eye level when in use. The best part of this holder was that even when it was being used, it took up no real estate on the desk surface. Sadly, that particular style just doesn't work as well with LCD monitors.So I tried the 3M In-line copy holder. I'll admit, I didn't notice when I ordered it that it is 18 wide, although it is clearly stated in the product description. That's my own fault. Still, I can't imagine that many people would be willing to sacrifice an area of their desk 18 inches wide and 11 inches deep to make room for a copy holder. I'm sure there are a few that have some use for a copy holder this big, but I personally don't and consequently find it unwieldy both when I am trying to use it and when I am trying to store it while not in use.In addition, the string that is supposed to hold the pages down pops off and flies across the room very easily - so easily that the guys in my office find it hard to resist once they see it happen accidentally. Boys will be boys, you know. It is extremely aggravating when this occurs on its own while you are trying to use the holder.I do give it points for holding the paper at a good angle and also have to say that the device is very sturdily built, outside of the flimsy elastic string that is meant to hold the pages down.I don't think this copy holder would be a fit for the average user.

I remember when $100 ($65 Amazon price) actually bought something. Oh, wait, it still can. AppleTV is $100. A Roku box is $100. A Kindle is just $40 more. But, now in 2010 an 18 sheet of molded plastic two weighted plastic legs some assorted screws and knobs and a rubber band cost $100. I have to assume the mystery weight beads in the legs are made of a high tech alloy and the plastic sheet must be bullet proof? On top of that when assembled it's kind of wobbly. I'd have designed in a cross base support of some kind for rigidity. But, that might have driven the price up to $150? I did a quick search for a Copy Holder, what I found was a huge selection under $10. Granted many weren't as attractive as the 3M product but what price design for such an item. It just needs to hold paper or a book.If the constructed product didn't feel as wobbly as it does, maybe I'd forgive it. But, really, I can't get over the price to function ratio. I have many 3M products and many are well made and reasonably priced. I just can't review this product favorably. Your money is my concern. When you spend this much on a stationery product, it really should be beyond compare. This simply is not. There are better choices considering the price.

The elastic band reminds me of my daughter's elastic head wraps, and is adjustable up & down for books/documents of all lengths. Being elastic means it can hold different thicknesses from a single page document, thin magazine to a thick manual. I tested it with a 700 page cookbook & had no problems with it. I also put a 4 pound box of canned dog food on it (to test for weight) & it held nicely as long as the copy holder's tray/base (the piece that holds the book/document) was on the table.

The see-through acrylic is crystal clear so it allows you to easily see what's behind the copy holder. Brilliant! It's really quite amazing how such a simple contraption can prove so useful.However, this holder has a couple of flaws.Height adjustment:The board has tracks that the clamps on the sides clamp on to. The height is adjusted by moving the board along its tracks. The trouble is, after the clamps are loosened, the board doesn't slide straight up and down; the tracks tend to slide unevenly so the board is free to tilt from side to side. Another problem is the feet are not weighted enough, so you're going to have to hold them down while you attempt to straighten out the board. After you've made the desired adjustment, you have to keep holding it in place while you tighten the clamps. That's a lot of work to simply adjust the height.Tilt Adjustment:Again, the feet aren't weighted enough so you would have to hold both feet while you tilt the board to the desired angle.In addition, the board is HUGE (11 x 18) and unwieldy to move around. The 3 Copy Holder is best used as a semi-permanent fixture on your desk. And I would recommend it only if you have a lot of desktop space!There you have it!

I found it very ungainly, a pain to move around, and it simply took up way too much space. I couldn't fit it under my computer screen like it advertised and can't imagine it working that way unless your screen could go very high. So I have it off to the side of my screen; which is less than ideal but works.The second thing that really annoyed me was when I tried to turn the pages. There is a lip on the front of the black base that prevented me from turning the pages easily. I had to physically lift up the book and turn the pages so that they wouldn't scrape and start to tear on the lip. You wouldn't run into this issue if you are using loose-sheet pages instead of a book like I was, so it depends on what you are planning on using this for.That being said, there are some really great things about this. I love how the legs can pivot so you can stand it up straight or you can lean the book back. That was a REALLY nice feature.

This no doubt saved a tremendous amount in production costs (and lets the legs be attached in more than one place), but given the geometry of the item, I couldn't believe the holder wouldn't break if one of the legs was bent inward.I was wrong - the holder is designed so that the legs come off if they are bent inward or outward (for example, if the holder slips or is dropped). I'm not saying the item is unbreakable (it's not titanium), but it's far more sturdy than it looks.Pros and cons -- It's wide enough to hold a typical magazine, or a stack of 11x17 sheets placed horizontally, but this also means it takes up a lot of desk or counter space- There's an elastic band to hold the pages open, and mark a line, but this won't work if the copy hangs over the sides- The angle is completely adjustable- The legs are weighted to provide stability- The legs can attach anywhere on the sides of the flat, so the holder can hang off the edge of a shelf or counter, but it therefore may take a bit of fussing to get the legs even- The tray at the bottom (which would support the bottom of the copy) is slightly over an inch deep, so this isn't going to work for a big book like a bible.For cookbooks and cooking magazines, which is what I got it for, this holder is excellent, if a little industrial looking.

Also there are some great design features that are marred but some not so great design features.The good and bad:I called 3M and they have great customer service. This is good. The bad thing is I had to call them because the instruction manual is just three doubel sided sheets of paper listing diagrams on how to put together three types of document holders with some safety and warranty information and a parts list thrown in. The manual, which is written in four languages, fails to use any words to explain how to attach the base or line guide. If you bother to create a manual in four languages, some words describing how to put the holder together or the best way to use it would have been very helpful.The base, which is really two legs, is heavy. This is good since you can use large documents with this and it is important to have the weight to hold it steady. Unfortunately, after I slid the two legs into a groove on each side of the document holder and screwed them in I found they moved when I have moved the document holder. Perhaps then need to be tighter.You can change the angle of the legs if you want to change the angle of the document holder. This is good. The problem is since the legs are not connected to each other you have to make sure you angle each evenly or the holder will be wobbly.One good thing is after you figure how to put this together it is easy to take apart for storage. My desk space is limited and this is large so I have taken it apart and reassembled it on a couple of occasions.Conclusion:If you are looking for a large document holder, this will do the trick once you have it assembled and in one place.

It's great! No more falling music books!Overall, this isn't a very portable copy holder and it takes up a lot of space, though the clear Lucite keeps it from looking as bulky as it is. For me, it's worth every inch it eats - and since it's clear, it doesn't look as bulky as it is. I love it!",5,"Researcher's, Cook's, and Musician's Delight",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",0.3959
44,A301B6L3TCD7WL,B00006B7UW,Tanya McHenry,"[0, 0]","I guess I really didn't realize just how big this thing is. Sure it gives the dimensions, but being able to open up a magazine or a small book and rest it on this holder is pretty great. There is also enough room for a couple of separate sheets to view side by side. The clear plastic seems sturdy enough, but I have concerns about the black legs, or more precisely, the area where the legs attach to the larger piece. That thin black piece seems prone to breakage. It has NOT happened yet, and I don't see this happening under regular use, but if you move this thing and the legs, which are heavy and wobble when moved attached, snagged on something, I really think you'll lose it.Despite its size, the copy holder is pretty well designed to be unobtrusive and sits fairly well on my desk, mostly out of the way. Depending on how your desk it designed, mine has some cubby space where the legs slip in for example, you may or may not have room to keep this thing out of your way.Now the only thing I absolutely hate about this thing the line guide. Just think about what happens when you accidently snap a rubber band. I pull on it a bit and one side, always the right side, slips free and snaps. It's so prone to this that just adjusting the holder or moving it causes it to come lose. It's really the only complaint I have about the copy holder at this point.If you have a need for a copy holder, I've seen worse, and this really isn't too bad and I think the main piece is going to hold up pretty well actually.",4,Pretty Well Built Except a Few Pieces Cause a bit of Worry,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",0.1571

The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it. The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair, with two plastic attachments to it. For this price a few extras should have been included. I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply cannot handle the weight.Overall, it works ok, but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect.",2,Not up to 3M usual high quality products.,1285804800,"09 30, 2010",0.4244
47,AMBFK6N4JS5Z2,B00006B7UW,V. Hutson,"[1, 2]","This is a very useful product. It holds items such as books, papers, and it can even be used as an art easel! The leg arrangement makes it a bit bulky and awkward to move around--but it is also the unique leg arrangement that allows it to be adjusted in so many ways and the weight of the legs is what keeps it sturdy. I like the clear plastic backing which actually creates a very clean, contemporary, and lightweight appearance.Bottomline: Great item if you don't need to move it around a lot!",4,Very functional!,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",0.3548
48,A4D5B7Q8A7PA6,B00006B7UW,Vynny Vynrod,"[2, 3]",When I got this I really didn't appreciate how much real estate an 18 item would take. The footprint is large - at least a foot behind the holder too so you're losing a lot of desk area once it's together and in place. I kind of wish it was smaller maybe with pocket eaves at the ends that could be pulled out to increase the horizontal width of the holder. This way it could still retain a large opened book but be reduced for smaller documents and paper. I know 3M sell a smaller version of this holder but I think it could have been engineered in such a way that one size fits all. Do keep in mind that this is a very big document holder; take the time to measure an area at least 20x15 to one side of your monitor to establish if you have room for it. 3M's brag of it sitting between your monitor and keyboard really doesn't ring true with today's flatscreen monitors. My 28 screen is a mere two inches off the desk so this item would block the view to about 50% of my screen if I placed it there.Still if you do need a document holder this vast that does the job right then this is it! Assembly took no time and once together you know this thing isn't going to move or fall over. I placed ream of paper on it (more than the recommended amount of pages) and it withstood the weight without folding in on itself. So it works and works well - the band which holds the pages open is useful although flimsy.If you're currently propping up a book by leaning it against a pile of other books then you should treat yourself to the 3M Copy Holder. It's more than big and strong enough for the job and fairly priced.,4,Useful but BIIG!,1289952000,"11 17, 2010",0.0121

With it, you don't really need to remove the item to see your Computer screen. It seems to be of very good quality. I didn't give it another star 'cause I wished it would have been a bit easier to remove when needed. It kind of bends in the middle when moving it. But, all in all a handy item to have around.",4,Good item,1285200000,"09 23, 2010",0.3079
