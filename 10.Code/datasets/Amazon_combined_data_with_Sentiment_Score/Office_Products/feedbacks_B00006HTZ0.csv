My wife favors it because, &#34;it's coloered to match&#34; everything else, black. The old mouse mouse was white.

Occasionally, it will not track correctly, and I have to give the mouse an extra nudge, but so far this has been a rare occurrence. The only problem I have had was that the mouse pad reeked of chemicals (the rubber bottom?) when I removed it from the box, but that has almost entirely dissipated. If I put my nose next to it I can still detect the smell, though. Someone with a sensitive nose might be bothered.",4,Plays Well With Optical Mice,1276905600,"06 19, 2010",-0.1226

14,AEJAGHLC675A7,B00006HTZ0,John Williamson,"[12, 12]","At the price that's offered, it's no wonder that thisBelkin 8-by-9-Inch Mouse Pad (Black)is the #1 in sales for mouse pads. It's simple, basic black and the perfect 9.2 x 8.3 inches that have almost become an industry standard. There are no duckies, Hawaiian tropical flowers, basset hounds, sports team logos, photos of Sports IllustratedSports Illustrated swimsuit models, hot air balloons, comic book characters, or images of mountains that you'll probably never visit. It's just a basic black mouse pad; nothing more, nothing less.But... oh, the smell! Maybe that's an added feature, a freebie that wasn't noted in the product specs?Actually, there's a fast and easy solution to remove that somewhat noxious odor, but bear with me so that you'll understand the logic. Some of the first mouse pads were actually made from manufacturer's scrap of the same neoprene foam backed with a thin sheet of nylon or Spandex that we find in Scuba and free-divewetsuits, and some of us made out own mouse pads from worn out or badly torn wetsuits.So what does this have to do with smelly mouse pads?That's easy: those old wetsuits stunk when new, but one hoped the atrocious smell would go away by the second or third dive. However, they smelled like a cross between a wet dog and dead opossum road kill when left in a plastic bag in the trunk of a car for a few days after a dive, so they had to be washed... and quickly. Today we have products such as Sink The Stink Wetsuit Wash and others to deal with getting rid of the stench. But these cost more than the mouse pad itself, which is ridiculous.The solution is simple: wash the mousepad thoroughly with your standard kitchen dishwashing soap. Good old green Palmolive works fine. Rinse it and gently wring out the excess water, then wash it again the same way (think of it like shampooing your hair). Set it on a flat surface between layers of paper towels to blot up the excess water. Depending on your climate, it should be dry and ready to use within a day or two. I'm not going to suggest that you try this, but there are some of us who take our mouse pads and put them in the washing machine with older dark clothes. Just remember to not put them in a clothes dryer.OK, back to the mouse pad.It's good, it's priced right, it's functional, it will work with just about any mouse, be it optical or the older one with mouse balls. Wash it and get rid of that smell that makes one think you pulled it out of a garbage dump or an old tire recycling plant and it will last a long time.9/5/2012",4,Belkin Mouse Pad: Such a deal... such a smell!

I've own/used plenty of mouse pads over the years and never noticed any type of nasty smell to them. They generally don't smell at all. I ended up putting this one in the cold garage for a few days and now the smell isn't as noticeable. If it really bothers you, you could try putting it in a bag with a dryer sheet.
