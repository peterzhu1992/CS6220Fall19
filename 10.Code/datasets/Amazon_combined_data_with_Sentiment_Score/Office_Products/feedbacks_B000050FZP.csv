0,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,B000050FZP,"Allen Smalling Eclectic Reader,","[9, 10]",".This review is of the AT&T; Trimline model 210, made by Advanced American Telephone under license from AT&T.; Along with similarly-shaped Trimstyle and other imitator models, there are readily available two other, similar phones entitled to use the term Trimline: one marketed by Northwestern Bell (which sells a lot of corded phones); the other the model 205 Trimline, as one expects a bit simpler than the model at hand. The model 210 Trimline has a long history of production at different sites, with few pauses from the mid-1960s to the present. During the early days of renting the phone from Ma Bell they were made in Indiana (rotary models, too); then (according to Wikipedia) tone models came out of Singapore, the Philippines, Mexico, China and again China. I think the advantages definitely outweigh the disadvantages of owning a newly made model 210, and I'll elaborate:PROS: Fully modular: not only the handset but the line cord is modular, including lead into the telephone base itself (prior reviewers did not find that feature) . This makes extending the line cord a breeze, substituting either a very long male/male phone cord, or inserting a modular (F/F) adapter in the middle of two conjoined male/male cords. I've tried that and found fit-and-finish were fine with GE brand coupler from the Also bought recommendations at this site.A little heavier than some previous retro Trimlines, but of course not nearly so heavy as the originals of the Sixties and Seventies;Receiver volume can be raised or lowered via switch on the outside of the handset;Inside the phone below the number pad are found an OFF-LO-HI volume switch (note that it is possible to turn the ringer off entirely, although some earlier reviews have said the contrary). Chirper is a moderate, office-style pitch, nothing extraordinary;Can hold (if the specs are right) up to 13 stored numbers, although that may really mean ten stored numbers plus the three feature buttons for Fire, Police and Ambulance;It can indeed mount on a wall--just follow instructions.Small footprint and an acknowledged classic design, down to the rounded rectangular buttons on the handset. Lack of ringer bell notwithstanding, this is probably the Trimline design and touchpad layout that best mimics the Bell (Western Electric) Trimlines of 40 years ago.Switchable Tone/Pulse on handset should anyone still need to imitate rotary-dial pulls with Pulse;Surprisingly cheap. This model retails at thirty-two .95 (and you can expect to see it a great deal cheaper here) Accessories are cheap, but color issues may arise (see below)..CONS: No one really knows how long this particulate incarnation is going to last under ordinary residential use.. Some prior reviewers had their Trimlines fail almost immediately; others have kept this same model no. for ten years and more;Handset has buttons for Flash, Redial and Mem[ory], but not a dedicated Hold button per se;This is not a two-line phone; even the cheapest of them cost more;The lit handset is indeed so dimly lit as to be practically useless. At least no separate AC connection is required.There is nothing remotely domestic (USA/Can) about 210's current manufacturing site, China;The coiled handset cord provided is short (a loop of about 32 inches stretched but not overstressed; i.e. about 1.4 feet per side); and . . .Finding a new longer coiled handset cord, while easy as to function with so many suppliers around, has proved to be a real BEAR when it comes to matching colors! This AT&T; white is more of an off-white, not the Polar white of GE/RCA white phone accessories, nor anyone else's ivory, ash, or beige that I can determine. Technically off-white as a color still exists in the canon of AT&T; accessories, but.... please let me know if you find any.And speaking of which, despite a need, product instructions lack any attempt to sell accessories like phone cords by mail or web.SUMMARY: If you want a corded phone with a small footprint for light use that weighs a little more than was strictly necessary, the current 210 should serve. But if you want only one main corded phone for the living room, kitchen or office, there are plenty more choices out there. For about twice the money you can get a speakerphone white model out of Northwestern Bell and other Bell competitors and survivors; with not only speakerphone but more memory, usually a dedicated `Hold' button . . . and at the higher price ranges genuine TWO-line phones make their appearance! (This may beg the question of why a second corded line is needed, but there are home/office situations where that's for the best.)Whether your backup is a rarely used cell phone prone to battery depletion, or a traditional corded phone like the Trimline 210, test it every now and then. No one wants to come across failure during a real emergency situation.Along with its Brady Bunch-era charm, the Trimline 210 is a recognized design classic. If you find it a little too bland and you want to make a stronger nostalgia statement, repro-retro Princess phones are not hard to find. To buy American, some residential phones out of Cortelco that were manufactured in the USA can still be found. Good luck whatever your decision, and if any of you know how to find accessories (peripherals) like an AT&T; coiled handset cord in their signature off-white version of white, kindly Comment here to that effect!

These also have physical switches to adjust the ringer volume and phone volume which, although limited, does give us some control.

This doesn't sound like much, but it makes a difference in a noisy atmosphere.- The buttons are good sized and light well enough to see in dim lighting.- The volume is adjustable and even though I am slightly hard of hearing, it is more than adequate without turning it all the way up.- The price! The price! The price! It's a bargain!CONS:- The base is light for a desk-top type phone. Got to be careful when you yank it around - it will fly off the counter.

22,A1TJT6GXDGNN8Q,B000050FZP,JustAnotherEngineer,"[0, 0]","August 2012. I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage. They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call. Cost was $9.00 each with free shipping (assuming the order totaled at least $25.00)Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted, those statements are simply NOT true. I have two of these phones, both of which are currently wall mounted. As noted in the instructions, you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting. That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit. This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically. To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.Another bit of confusion. A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one. That is not true, at least in 2012. The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.Yet despite that mis-information - I'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality. Every time I answer these phones people complain (unsolicited) about the voice quality. A hard wired phone (as opposed to a cordless) should sound great but clearly these phones don't! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic, at about $30.00.",2,A Value Priced Phone that is functional but the voice quality is poor,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",-0.0617

Although this phone is clearly not the same as the real Bell trimline phones, it still has the great, comfortable design and the dialpad in the handset, which makes it an excellent choice. I've compared several other trimline phones and this is the closest phone I could find to the original Bell phones.Northwestern Bell also makes a trimline phone, but the quality and comfort are nowhere near this AT&T; version.If you read the other reviews, you will see that at least one review (dated November of 2004) says that this phone was discontinued.

Sherwin,"[97, 103]","I recently bought this phone after several two more expensive models failed; his telephone by AT&T; and Lucent works better than the other phones I bought when I had to get a new phone for my home. The construction of this telephone reflects great engineering; and it's very, very reliable for a price that's very inexpensive these days for a phone. Yes, it is corded; but when all you really need is a basic phone this really does the job. Besides, the fact that this is corded means you'll never misplace the cordless handset!The phone has back lit buttons which are desirable for those of us who are elderly or in any way sight impaired. The buttons could be brighter but the back lighting does improve upon no lighting. The phone offers well known features including last number redial, too. The phone has a mute feature, adjustable ringer volume and more. These functions never disappoint me. It also has a small knob that lets you switch between touch tone and pulse (rotary) dialing. I use touch tone dialing as most people do. I am particularly impressed that a phone in this price range even has a twelve number memory feature for speed dialing. Cool! However, as another reviewer correctly notes, when you program the phone to remember frequently dialed numbers, you need to actually dial the number--so hang up fast if you don't intend to speak with that person at just that moment! I don't care for that so I will take off one star for this.If you want to take a nap without the phone ringing, just turn the ringer off by using the knob at the base of the phone. That's an incredibly useful feature!I highly recommend this telephone for people who merely want a basic, inexpensive phone that still has a few frills to like including memory speed dialing and mute. The extra features give you all you truly need to make this a well constructed telephone at a rather inexpensive price. Sure, the back lighting for the buttons on the phone could be brighter; but overall this is still quite a good phone for the price.
