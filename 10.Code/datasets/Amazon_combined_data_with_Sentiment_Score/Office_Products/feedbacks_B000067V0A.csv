We recently bought a used 2200 to use in our small business for printing product pictures and custom images for retail sales on very heavy card stock. The results have been nothing short of amazing!The main features that made this the right choice for us were:+ Individual ink cartridges - saves money in the long run since you only replace the ones that are empty (a good deal can be found hereEpson 7 Color Ink Set with Photo Black for the Stylus Photo 2200 Inkjet Printer.)+ Accepts Very Thick Card Stock - using the rear feed port+ Outstanding Prints - the output is nothing short of amazingMy only complaint is that the rollers do need to be cleaned on occasion, but good instructions are found in the user manual. Hint: if you don't have the cleaning pad that came with the printer, use a bit of a cotton material wrapped on the thin edge of a ruler.Vista drivers (both 32 and 64 bit) can be downloaded from the Epson website.This is a very good printer and they can now be found for a reasonable priced on the used market! Highly Recommended!",5,Produces Fantastic Prints - Highly Recommended!,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",0.4501

The print quality / image is MORE difficult to achieve with this printer--not impossible, but more difficult. Overall, the paper profiles are fairly good (epson papers)--the colors are fairly accurate. However, the prints are definitely &quot;flatter&quot; (ie less contrast, less saturation) compared to the 1280--this can be worked around to a large extent by simply increasing contrast (esp the black point) and saturation...around by 10 points.3. Overall, I like the 1280 prints better to a slight degree, but if viewed by itself without a comparison print, the prints from the 2200 are good. Furthermore, with the increase in print life, overall it's a decent compromise for me. One has to evaluate their own priorities to see if it would be worth it for them.",3,Epson 2200 Review,1030838400,"09 1, 2002",0.1593
2,A1N10E26UAQ2TF,B000067V0A,Matthew,"[3, 3]","This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen. If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear. Granted, when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images. If you are not constantly printing, the nozzles will clog. It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer. After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer, I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000. My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable!",1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,1314057600,"08 23, 2011",0.23
3,AQ2FC1DLKVD8H,B000067V0A,P. McWhorter,"[1, 1]","I have had my epson 2200 for ten years now, and it is still going strong. Yes, it uses a lot of ink, and yes, the ink is expensive, but the results are well worth it. I find it works better if it is used often.This is not a printer for the timid. However, if you are willing to spend the time learning about the color management, and calibrations, the unit delivers spectacular prints.I am particularly impressed with the print quality from this machine. I use the velvet fine art paper, and find the prints are extremely stable, and the colors do not fade or shift.",5,Exceptional Prints,1281830400,"08 15, 2010",0.5087
4,A3FKPBNI7UWQFW,B000067V0A,Work of Life,"[2, 2]","The Epson 2200 set the standard for the pro-sumer photo printer. I've had one since 2003 and I still love it. I am a professional photographer, but I use the 2200 for many of my personal (as opposed to professional) projects. I work in a very modern photo studio that regularly updates its technology; be it photo gear, computers, projectors, printers, software, etc. Yet, I often find myself using my trusty 2200 again and again. It is the versatility and simplicity that brings me back. Sure, it uses ultrachrome ink and can be configured for most papers. My personal projects tend to be heavy in black/white images and the 2200 gives a professional and consistent look to my work. I use only matte papers with the 2200 as the glazing effect produced on pearl, luster or gloss papers is distracting and unprofessional. 2200's printers can now be acquired for a pittance. Though I have several other printers in my work flow, I might very well buy another 2200 if mine were to go down. These are a steal for hobbyists that want to play with printing professional archival black and white images.",4,2200 set the standard!,1227916800,"11 29, 2008",0.0824
