4,A22BPC7LRSGSYQ,B00000I9HF,Joker,"[1, 1]","These Maxell 8 mm camcorder tapes are a pretty good product. I bought these years ago when I needed to borrow my brother's camcorder that requires 8 mm tapes. Nowadays, they're getting harder and harder to find, as everything now is digital/hard disk. The picture and sound quality on these tapes isn't quite as good as the more expensive 8 mm metal tapes, but it's decent enough to do an adequate job of capturing your moments. I swear, the picture and sound quality on the 8 mm camcorders and 8 mm metal tapes is sometimes better than some of the top-of-the-line hard disk camcorders. I have a hard disk camcorder, but sometimes I wish I had an 8 mm camcorder.I recommend these Maxell 8 mm tapes, but I would try to get the metal kind if you want REALLY good picture and sound quality.",4,Pretty decent picture quality,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",0.3571
