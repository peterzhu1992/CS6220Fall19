I was unable to find anyone who repairs monitors like this, too. Great while it lasted, but reliability is unclear (search on yamaksasi monitor failure and you'll see a lot of them die at just over ~1 yr. I suspect a blown cap in the inverter from the symptoms). Also runs unusually hot at full brightness (both the screen and the power brick get quite hot). To be fair, it's a heck of a steal otherwise, and the image quality and speed are terrific (you must have a DIV-D input, not just DVI-I or any other format like dp or hdmi or VGA; DVI-D has a full rectangle of pins on the plug, not two groups of pins. Search on DVI connector and you'll see lots of illustrations of the types if you're unsure). Great for spreadsheets, gaming, etc. But...it died prematurely.",3,died just after warranty,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",-0.0065

2,A204N1U3TI06GO,8918010656,Cry,"[0, 0]",The monitor has only brightness and power controls. There are five other unmarked buttons that do nothing observable. There is only one DVI plug. The included cable worked fine for me.I am running the monitor on RHEL 6.4. The monitor periodically (once a week) would forget how to transmit its EDID on reset from standby. I ended up downloading the EDID from the monitor and setting up my xorg.conf to load from file rather than from the monitor. No more issues.I'm using the monitor in a dual-head sitting beside and HP 30&#34; supplied by work. The height on the HP is adjustable to exactly match the Yamakasi.,4,Image is indistinguishable to my eyes to HP 30 zDisplay,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",0.0077
3,A25X0R6758CLWJ,8918010656,Dr.Poonchai Chitanuntavitaya,"[2, 2]","Since the resolution is great at 2560*1600 you can view magazine like HBR or Scientific America in dual page with crystal clear, flicker free. you need a proper placement on table since it cannot raise monitor up like my previous Dell 24 inch. The brightness and IPS performance so stunning. For Thailand friend, they send direct to your home and pay custom for 1700 B. Then this monitor is much cheaper than any 27 inch with same resolution selling in Thailand.Dr.PoonchaiBangkok, Thailand",5,"If you love to read Magazine, I would like to recommend this great monitor",1393027200,"02 22, 2014",0.4816
4,A37AO20OXS51QA,8918010656,Roderic Rinehart Roderic,"[0, 0]","MUCH BETTER THAN THE 1440p QNIX AND DESTROYS ALL 1080p.This puts all the 120/144 hz stuff to bed. Unless you play *seriously* competitively (and you probably do not), then 1600p IPS absolutely destroys 1080 monitors with much higher refresh rates. Those are ok monitors and just fine, but if you have the horsepower( r9 290 or 290x, 780 or 780ti can DEFINITELY max this baby, other slightly lower cards still work very well, as well as crossfire and SLI), get this.No dead pixels, GORGEOUS SCREEN, and a really good stand. Straight monitor with no BS features. It turns on. It's a boss. It turns off.",5,Stunning and affordable!,1403395200,"06 22, 2014",0.0284
5,A24S76CQYV9ONA,8918010656,Thomas M. Meadows,"[0, 6]","[[EDIT]]Now that I have upgraded my graphics card to a 2GB DDR5 card with a DVI-D port on it, the monitor gives me the full 1080p for movies and general resolution of 2560X1600. This was the problem. If you have a standard on board/integrated graphics card, then this monitor might not work for you.... you may not have a DVI-D port and it may not be able to support this hulk. On a different retail site, this company's recommendation was to have a minimum 1GB on your graphics card, and upgraded to a 2GB that is working quite well.I'm not a movie junkie but the colors look good to me. I have no complaints about the display.The monitor does run HOT though, which I think is typical for this style.ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW, unedited:It came with no English manual, and no DVDs for drivers.Windows is running mine with the generic driver. The best resolution I can get is 1280X800, which looks horrific.I'm aware that the problem *might* be my graphics card, but this card is definitely capable of handling at least 1080p, and I cannot get even that. I actually can set it to 1080p, but I immediately get a black screen with colorful bar code gibberish.Can't get a setting for anything higher than 1080p, and definitely cannot actually use 1080p.I'm open to suggestions on how to fix this, especially if the seller is reading this. I'll bump this to 5 stars if they can help me resolve this (I will send an inquiry if I cannot get it fixed soon).",4,MUST HAVE DVI-D port to get full resolution! Good monitor otherwise!,1394841600,"03 15, 2014",0.2794
6,AEPTZ4SG6U3UE,8918010656,V. M. Staring into the Beyond,"[14, 14]","Here's what you want to know.The stand is FINE. There are only 5 working buttons on this. This is the power button, a brightness button(s), and volume buttons. There is no other screens, setups, no calibrations, etc. All of that has to be done on your PC connected to this. It is literally a straight monitor. As advertised, not 1 dead pixel.Resolutions excellent.There is a powerbrick with this item (just an FYI). Haven't had any issues with it.To mount the monitor on the monitor mount, put the backend on first, then put the big base on the 4 feet, screw them in (recommend using a drill on a very low setting to affix it. The DVI connector is a good length.I'd recommend it. Went from a dual monitors at 1920x1080 (24 inch) to this beast. Night and day. I can have two documents up side by side with room to spare (my girl reviews allot of documents, and she was liking this hunking thing too). It is a Large monitor (comparable to a 30 inch TV).Yes the instructions are in Korean, who cares. The box has the whole sparta theme on it, don't care either. It is a good monitor, good response time, awesome resolution.I would do this monitor at 2560x1600 vs a 4k monitor for 4 reasons.1) 4k monitors are $1,000+. Yes there are cheaper ones but there cheaper because...2) Most 4k monitors run at 30hz. Basically it means that the monitor can only display 30hz. THIS monitor displays at 60 hz (which is fantastic). To clarify, essentially hz is pretty much how much fps a monitor can display per second. Now you can have a 4k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at 1000 fps, your monitor will only support 30 fps of it (its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter, and you want at least 60, if not more3) 4k monitors may require more than 1 connection (aka 2 dvi port connections) to run well.4) 4k is still reaaaaly new. There working the bugs out regarding creating a gaming 4k monitor that isn't over $1000.This is a 30 inch monitor, well under the 700 to 800 pricerange of other monitors that do the same thing as this one.To the gamers out there, loaded up counter strike, awesomenauts, eve online, all ran at this resolution, full screen, no bars.",5,Excellent Monitor,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",0.2303
