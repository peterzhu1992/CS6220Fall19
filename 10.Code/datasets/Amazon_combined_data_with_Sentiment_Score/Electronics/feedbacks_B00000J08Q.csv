I do not have a phone line in that area and this seemed like a nice solution to the problem. This is a low data rate application and voice quality is clearly not of concern.

6,A1IF3VUAXBTX00,B00000J08Q,Joaquin Arosemena Bristol,"[1, 1]","This device did not work for me. They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal. That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers. In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours, so in my case it was very noisy making this adapters a total waist of money. I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me. But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones, so far I have not had any interference. You have to try them and see what works for you. Joaquin Arosemena",1,It picks up a lot of noise from household appliances.,1194393600,"11 7, 2007",0.1443

9,A1N3GNCJWXQ1ZP,B00000J08Q,"Robert Carnevali Typical, middle-aged guy","[11, 11]","I purchased this to add an extension phone line into my bedroom. Because of old wiring in the house, the phone jacks in my bedroom stopped working and no dial tone was available. While I use a cordless phone with the main base in the other room, I needed a phone jack so my Tivo could dial out and get programming information. When set up, the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them. I purchased this unit from a store after the clerk assured me the range and quality was good enough that I could use it almost anywhere in my house. After a lot of effort, I find the unit to be nearly worthless.The range is VERY limited. I made sure that the only obstructions between the transmitter and base were the two walls between the two rooms and nothing else (furniture, electronics, etc.) were in the way, yet there was no dial tone. I moved the receiver so that only a single wall was between the two units, and I did get a dial tone, but had such a bad signal that voice calls would be painful to listen to. I couldn't imagine using it with an electronic device (like a modem or Tivo) that sends data. I got the best signal when both devices were in the same room and within 15 to 20 feet of each other. Needless to say, with that kind of configuration, it's easier and cheaper to just run a long phone cord along the baseboard.",1,"Nearly Worthless, save yourself the aggravation and just run a phone line",1175299200,"03 31, 2007",0.0264

I'm not mechanically gifted in the least but this RCA Wireless Phone Jack did not test my technical acumen. (Thank goodness).It's easy to set up, just click in a couple of leads, plug it in the wall and voila!, instant dial tone, good to go and Bob's your uncle.",5,The one to get if you're technically challenged,1184889600,"07 20, 2007",0.274

I got a different brand that does not have the background noise. I hope it lasts.",2,Quit working within a week.,1230249600,"12 26, 2008",0.1468
12,ALDA72MNSJVOK,B00000J08Q,sonytoao,"[159, 163]","I use the RC926 to add an extra phone jack for my DirecTivos and standalone DirecTV receiver. All three receivers are split off from the extension jack and I have never had a problem with the units making the required service data call.Edit: I also have DSL but use 2Wire filters (not the generic filters provided by Verizon) for greater clarity. A filter has to be placed between the jack and the wireless BASE unit for the wireless extension unit to function properly with DSL.Note: Tivos and DirecTivos DO HAVE MODEMS so Rios' title header is somewhat misleading. But the facts in the body of the review are correct. Per Page 10 of RCA's manual (which is available on their website): Note: The maximum baud rate for the Wireless Phone Jack is 14,400. Best results, however, will be experienced at 9,600. This limitation is why I knocked off a star.So yes, I would not recommend that you attempt to surf the Internet using this jack or use it for any purpose where a high baud rate is important. But the phone jack is perfectly fine for voice, fax, and satellite receiver use.",4,Fine for Satellite Receivers Including Tivos,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",0.2498
13,A3NEAETOSXDBOM,B00000J08Q,Stephen M. Charme,"[4, 4]","I used to have a second phone line in an upstairs room that I used primarily for faxing and occasional phone calls. When I got rid of that line, I bought this wireless phone jack so that I could use my main phone line in the upstairs room without paying the phone company the considerable cost of running new wires.The product does work even though the base station is connected to a phone jack in a room that is not only downstairs, but is also separated by multiple doors and walls from my upstairs room, which is in another part of the house.This unit has enabled me to use my phone/fax machine to send and receive faxes without any problems. Making phone calls is a different story. Although there is always some noise on the line, sometimes it is so minimal that I can easily make a phone call and carry on a conversation. But other times the noise is so loud that it is not possible to use the phone to call someone.Bottom line: faxing is always possible, but voice conversations sometimes are not. You need to decide what your priorities are before you buy this.",3,Average product,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",0.1297

It just doesn't work well enough to keep.You can make an outgoing call on it, but it will not ring for an incoming call. No Caller ID, no ring, no nothing. Outgoing call sound quality is terrible--static and clicking noises. I tried several different jacks, outlets and locations. I wanted to make sure the units weren't too close, nor too far from each other. Tried different jacks, plugs, etc. Made sure it was plugged directly into an outlet.Nothing made any difference. Outgoing call quality was poor, incoming would NEVER work nor ring. Returned item.",1,"Just doesn't work, had to return",1280966400,"08 5, 2010",0.057
