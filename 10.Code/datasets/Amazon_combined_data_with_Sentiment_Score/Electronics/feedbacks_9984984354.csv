8,A2WXLG4AYEDOQI,9984984354,G. Wolfe wolfie,"[0, 0]","The price was certainly right! However, at ANY price, the product was worthless. The adapter size was OK and the cord was long enough... BUT the connector end was wrong. The shape was correct, but the size of the connector was much too small and would not fit the GPS device it was intended for, even though the Amazon description was very specific that this adapter was correct for the Garmin Nuvi 1450 it was bought for. Since the cost was nearly nil (other than a couple of bucks for shipping), I did not pursue replacement. I am still without an AC charger.",1,Unuseable product,1327276800,"01 23, 2012",-0.0545

I had it plugged in using this device for 3 hours and it still was not fully charged. You may as well use the blackberry cell cord to charge; it also takes this long to charge the device.
