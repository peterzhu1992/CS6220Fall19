1,A2OCFY81BELYVJ,B00000J1U8,Book Lover,"[0, 0]",This makes it much easier to plug and unplug USB devices. Also allows me to play on my device while it remains plugged in. I measured it to be sure and it is 6 feet and an inch - so they did not short me on the length at all. I recommend this quality product.,4,Does the job,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",0.3602

6,A37KC1KU0JPI1K,B00000J1U8,Drakkenfyre,"[0, 0]","It's an extension. Kind of hard to say more than that. It's a Belkin cable, so it's good quality. The ends have molded strain reliefs. This is a USB 1.1 cable, however, so data transfer speeds will be slower.

The one thing is that if you use a Mac keyboard, they have the shortest cord ever.

My webcam would not attach and sit securely atop my laptop screen that I use. Because of this I had to position it on a nearby flat surface, but the cord was too short for my needs.
