0,A2A2JYDOR6GJ3E,8862935293,Amazon Customer,"[3, 3]","I've used this cover with both a Kindle (Generation 2) and a Nook. Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now. The Nook lacks this 5 way directional key entirely, so again - no issues there. (This issue might also be contributed to the breaking in of the case so that the spine is not rigid anymore and allows the front to move at angles. I don't believe I've been rough with the case though, so I can only assume its common wear).I also want to through my hat into the ring in regards to the less than compact design - though in truth I don't think it could have been any slimmer without causing negative pressure to the devices when closed.",2,Design works better with a Nook than a Kindle.,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",0.1534

What kind of silliness is THIS???Love it in every way except that darned lack of a pen loop - clipping a pen to it is not the same and I don't want to dent up the cover...Wish it came in more colors, like Moleskine RED and the other Volant shades -- and that one could get the reporter notebooks in colors, too... but this doesn't mean I'm not happy with this!",4,Terrific Cover w/Notepads - but NO PEN LOOP?

I use it and am happy with it.Pros:- Looks and feels like a Moleskine- Looks enough like a book or journal to disguise the Kindle- Looks nice on the inside and outside- Having a pad next to a Kindle is very good- Includes two reporter-style while slimmed-down MoleskinesCons:- No place to store a writing utensil- Won't fit standard Moleskine reporter books, even the soft cover ones (too rigid backing, too thick)- A lined journal would have been better- Feels like it needs another slit at the base to keep the journal from getting loose- Hard to get the elastic straps for the Kindle to look right",4,"Good accessory, but left side is limited",1278979200,"07 13, 2010",0.6667

It's a sturdy case that looks great and performs well. It's the first Kindle case I've owned that seems to be a permanent living space for my Kindle, if you know what I mean.A few reviewers seem to not like it because the notepad is on the left, while the Kindle is on the right. I can understand their reasoning, but I actually prefer it the way it is - and I'm right-handed. If the Kindle were on the left, with the notepad on the right, it would be more awkward to hold. For the few notes I take on paper, it's really no big deal to reach over the screen to do so.That said, Moleskine ought to offer both a left and right handed version if the case. I would think it'd be easy to simply flip the design. Then people could choose which version they wanted.",4,"Does what it says, nothing more, nothing less.",1279670400,"07 21, 2010",0.0819
5,AJ7GOBURILNOF,8862935293,Spencer Koch,"[1, 2]","I purchased this because I was basically afraid to take my kindle anywhere without the case, and I love Moleskine notebooks. The surface of the cover is soft... not like a normal Moleskine notebook. The top left elastic strap does (minorly) interfere with the operation of the on switch. It doesn't really bother me all that much though. I have had mine for a week or two now, and it still has a chemical smell to it. Be prepared to let it air out for a while.",3,Not quite a Moleskine,1280620800,"08 1, 2010",0.183
