1,A15U38AWJ3JDN5,B00000IGBF,"[1, 1]","I've had my Palm IIIx for over a year now, but I'm going to have to get another, because I dropped it. The Palm didn't fall far -- 3 feet or so -- but it is now useless. White lines cover the display, and the digitizer no longer works reliably. I have tried opening up the case and re-seating the circuit boards, which fixed most of the problems, but the digitizer is permanently inaccurate. Even with re-calibration of the digitizer using preferences, the location the Palm thinks I'm hitting with the stylus is wrong, and this makes using the Palm impossible.I bought the slimline leather case, but this clearly failed to protect the Palm in any way. Also, the velcro has now come unstuck, so my Palm won't stay in the case.This is a real shame, as my Palm IIIx is indispensable. I bought Intellisync software to syncrhonize it to the calendaring software I have on my PC, and I use it every day to navigate my schedule. Combined with the address book for names and phone numbers, I have one place to work out what I'm supposed to be doing and whom I'm doing it with.I don't use the other applications much. I tried out the e-mail application, but it is way too simplistic. I get over 200 e-mails a day, and I really need e-mail folders with automatic filtering to manage that kind of volume. I use Eudora, and the Palm e-mail application doesn't support its folders or filtering. I can't even convince it to just download the messages left in my &quot;in&quot; box after all the others have been filtered out.Being able to upgrade the operating system on the IIIx turned out to be important. Version 3.3 of PalmOS supports infra-red sync with a laptop. This is a godsend when I'm travelling, and for syncing during long meetings. Being able to upgrade easily from PalmOS 3.1 made it possible.I have also downloaded a few games to while away long plane trips -- PocketChess is my favourite. Very easy to play -- just drag 'n' drop the pieces.I have looked at the Handspring Visor as a replacement, but lack of upgradeabile OS is a key sticking point. Handspring devices are stuck at Palm OS 3.1, and Handspring's code seems to have diverged at this point with no hope of picking up any changes post-version 3.1. Long term, this could turn into a real problem assuming Palm continues to improve PalmOS. The Springboard expansion slot is a great idea, but there are so few expansion cards available that its utility is a joke. Color cases looked cool -- until I saw them in real life vs. a photo on the web. They look kinda cheap &amp; nasty.So, I'll probably buy another Palm IIIx. The IIIe isn't expandable, and I can't see how color is so useful that it justifies the staggering price of the IIIc. The Palm V looks cool but I'm even more worried about its fragility, and the Palm VII could be great if it could actually surf the web, rather than use extraordinarily limited &quot;web clippings&quot;.",3,"Great product, but fragile",957484800,"05 5, 2000",,0.039
2,ASWYSSKL9LL9X,B00000IGBF,"[9, 11]","The palm will certainly revolutionize the way you arrange your life. At the touch of a button, you can connect it to your PC and transfer all of its information (which also means you can input information to your palm from your PC). There's a myriad of freeware available on the net that will enhance the performance of the Palm IIIx. The screen is great for viewing. 4MB is more than you'll ever need (I have many programs loaded, and thousands of phone numbers and appointments, and I only use 1.3 MB).The great advantage of the Palm IIIx is that it uses batteries (versus the Palm V and Vx, which are rechargeable), which means you don't have to carry your cradle when you travel, and you can get batteries for it anywhere! Small, lightweight, highly efficient. I highly recommend it.",5,"Wonderful, great value!",948758400,"01 25, 2000",amazonreader,0.3983

4,A34PNHKNM05TXD,B00000IGBF,"[30, 31]","Having used a paper Daytimer for years, I was a little skeptical about going electronic with my datebook and phone listing. Boy, have I been converted! The Palm IIIx (my second Palm - the first being a III) is, for me, a great value.It has enough memory for anyone but the most compulsive note-taking, yellow page totin' workaholic among us. (I download an average of 300 Palm formatted web pages a day and have had no problem with space in memory at all. I also keep about 700 phone listings and several hundred appointments in the unit at all times) It has the improved screen and processor versus the III. And it has the benefit of the Palm community of software developers that is what sets Palm devices apart from Windows CE (and other) devices.I like the fold-over cover both for protection and for the Star Trek communicator look :) and feel. The backlight takes a little getting used to. It is not useful at all for dim daylight use, but works just fine in dark situations.I really want the Palm Vx for the sexy size and industrial feel, but I have no real reason to move away from a device that does everything I need and more (and costs a lot less).",4,What wouldl I do without it?,953337600,"03 18, 2000",Kevin P.

5,A2PVD9N0YBE1E3,B00000IGBF,"[4, 4]","I have had my Palm IIIx for almost 5 years now, and it is still working as well as the day I bought it! I am more than satisfied with Palm products, and am currently looking into a Tungsten as an upgrade. The Windows based palmtops are nice too, but they cannot beat the Palm's reliability and ease of use. The software is also very stable and easy to use. This is the only device of its kind I own that has never lost data or become corrupted. Reliability goes a long way with me, so I give it 5 stars!",5,5 Years and Going Strong!,1110844800,"03 15, 2005",M. Angelone mangelone,0.464
6,ARXU3FESTWMJJ,B00000IGBF,"[186, 188]","The big questions these days is what organizer to get. I'll assume you are reading these reviews because you already know that the Palm OS beats CE any day. So the choice is a Palm Vx, a Palm V, a IIIx or a Visor. I can't recommend the Visor right now due to the horrible problems people are having with Handspring...maybe in another year, but not now.The new Vx is a good choice, lots of memory and the other advantages of the Palm V like a better screen, and rechargeable battery. But the darn thing is still overpriced. If money is no problem though, I'd probably go with the Vx.The V is good too, but only 2 meg of memory...yuck! Now, 2 meg of memory is going to be enough for a lot of people. If all you want to do is the basic appointment/phone book/to-do stuff, 2 meg is more than you'll ever need. But that's it...you're stuck with 2 meg and can't upgrade (easily). If you are interested in using your Palm to do internet stuff, grab webpages with AvantGo, play games, read books, etc. you're going to find yourself a bit squeezed by 2 meg. You can still do quite a bit, but it's a bit more work to manage your space.Now, for less money you can get the IIIx. You'll have twice as much memory, and the ability to upgrade. I personally put on the TRG xtra xtra pro board which gave me 4 meg more of RAM and 2 meg more Flash...it's like having an 11 meg Palm! Really great. Of course, I bought this before the Palm Vx came out, today it's not quite as good a deal to do.One other reason I like the Palm IIIx is that I have a lot of add-ons that only work with it...the Palm Navigator (compass), the Weatherguide, Landware's GoVox voice recorder, etc. I don't believe these will fit a Palm V. Of course, it goes both ways....Palm's new 33.6 modem and the new wireless Omnisky modem only fit the Palm V.I do believe the Palm V has a better screen, it doesn't seem to have the streaks that a lot of the Palm IIIx's have. And there's no doubt it has a certain &quot;coolness&quot; factor. Most of my friends at work went with the Palm V. But they are fairly impressed with the space and the accessories I have for my Palm IIIx.",4,A great choice but not perfect,946771200,"01 2, 2000",Mary Jo Sminkey 15 years of Amazon Reviews!,0.2554
7,A2CC2CRU24E44X,B00000IGBF,"[55, 55]","I have to say that I've grown very dependent on my IIIx. I'd give it a score of 5 except for the streaking problem. Mine didn't do this right away. It started hapening about 6 months after I began to use it. Sometimes its there sometimes it isn't. When its there, the streaking (looks like water was spilled on a sheet of ink writing) can make the screen totally unreadable. Five minutes later, all can be fine. PDA need to be dependable. Mine isn't always. Before I started reading other reviews, I thought mine was just broken. I was considering buying another but not if by luck, I get another &quot;streaker&quot;. Even though I like the IIIx, its reasonably priced (though still expensive), has great software options, I'd be cautious about buying another one. Probably wouldn't go with the IIIx if I had known about the streaking problem in advance.",3,Good but BEWARE the streaks,947030400,"01 5, 2000",NBO,-0.0369

Six weeks later, with no indication of when (if ever) the Visor would be shipping, she cancelled it and ordered the Palm IIIx for me instead. I've been playing endless with it since.I find, for example, it's easier to write on the PDA than on paper in a moving car; hence, car rides can be much more productive.Then I found out about downloading games from the Internet.
