0,A3UFCX1AE4TKZE,B00000DMA3,Ben,"[11, 11]","I've been using these for over a year now. Basically, in a quiet environment these sound pretty good. They aren't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets, but you're paying for the noise cancelling. The raw capability is pretty decent, and has acceptable detail in treble, vocal, and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well. I've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids. They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices, which is nice in the office.However, I must have pretty big ears, and I've found that the foam cups aren't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear. After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long, and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control. An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I don't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep. I think that the MDR-NC11's might have been a better choice in that regard.They're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in. I'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me, since the MDR-NC20's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets. I haven't had any spills yet, but active travellers may wish to find a case that's more rigid.All in all, I'm pretty happy with these. The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price... I couldn't justify the $300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups.",4,"Good sound, Good Noise Cancelling, Good for airplanes.",1104796800,"01 4, 2005",0.1851

2,A1Q5M90ZZEEAL1,B00000DMA3,Niall O'Driscoll,"[8, 9]","I bought these thinking they were the ticket to noise-free, pleasant air travel. They fall short for two reasons. The first is that they just don't cancel that much noise. If you're not listening to music and just compare the difference between having noise cancellation on and off, it's just not that great - partly because of the technology and partly because of the fit. To quantify this, the noise canceling Sony headphones give 10dB of noise reduction whereas the passive David Clark H10-00 headphones for roughly the same price give 24dB just because of the better seal. The second problem is that they generate noise of their own. If it's not that noisy to start with they actually seem to generate a slight buzz. So I'd recommend either getting a pair of earplugs, or a set of headphones with a better seal.",3,Not what I'd hoped for.,1096934400,"10 5, 2004",0.1861
3,A1N03V52IRZ5PR,B00000DMA3,N. J. Simicich Gadget Geek,"[0, 0]","I've owned these for years. I used to fly two round trips a week, and I wore these constantly, whether or not there was any reason to (in flight entertainment, a CD player).The first benefit is that the noise reduction made speech more audible. I could hear the person in the next seat better, and, in fact, I found that I could eavesdrop on people a row or two away, since the noise that would normally have masked their conversation was masked, but the speech came through.The loud, constant background sound in airplanes is very draining. I was more likely to be able to nap with these on, and I was more likely to be able to concentrate on reading with less background noise.Don't get a unit that simply insulates the sound - you might as well use earplugs or sealing earbuds. There is nothing wrong with that solution, it is just that the solution of generated countersound (exactly out of phase, exactly the right amount and frequency for the sound that is incoming), especially when the countersound is based on microphones that are right at the earphones - as far as I am concerned, nothing works as well.Microphones that are placed in an off-headphone device can't tell where the headphones are direction, or what in the environment might be changing the sound at the headphones. This effect is not as important at low frequencies, but it becomes more important at higher frequencies, so this unit can provide more coverage. The design is simply the best possible - microphones as close to the ear as possible is a huge design benefit.Well, being in a quiet environment works better, but that is not always available.When you are flying, especially if you fly a lot, small incremental increases in comfort really are worth it. These cost me less than a quarter per flight, have lasted years and are still going strong.Sound quality was fine. I could head spoken voice programming just fine, and, far as I was concerned, music was enjoyable. Airline provided programming was much better than the provided headphones.",5,The Get Smart Cone of Silence has finally been perfected.,1093305600,"08 24, 2004",0.424

Even so, there is a lot of pressure. After about an hour they start to hurt my ears. I have tried to stretch them, but they always return to the same size. I also put extra foam padding in the ear cups, which helped a little.They still have good sound quality, and cut noise- although they are not as effective as when I first bought them.I tried the new Bose. They fit better and they do a much better job of eliminating noise, but of course they are much more expensive.",3,Ouch- but they sound nice,1101427200,"11 26, 2004",-0.0749
