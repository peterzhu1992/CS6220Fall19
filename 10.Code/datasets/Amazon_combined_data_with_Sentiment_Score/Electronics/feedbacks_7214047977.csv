1,A1JZHU0WUCTO4C,7214047977,Kindle Customer,"[0, 0]","Good case, while not new to Kindle books I am new to Kindles, the Fire HD is my first one. I wanted some protection for it as well as something to hold it for me, I often read in bed and with this it stands up some. I wish it were more adjustable. The reality is the way I use it you have two choices, flat, or slightly inclined. The way the pictures show in the upper right it looks like it will stand almost upright, that's not practical for my purposes. I am not sure a case is made that would fit my desires, this is very nice although I felt overpriced.",4,Very nice case,1388793600,"01 4, 2014",0.2877

The case is nice for price, it does what it has to do but the smell at first is very unpleasant. I'm glad it arrived fast and I had time to leave it out of plastic for a few days to air out till smell went away.",4,Case is fine. Horrible smell tho had to air out,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",0.1053
5,A355M74J438SGG,7214047977,Sherry,"[0, 0]",i love this case fits my kindle perfectly the only thing i dont like is that the power button is not visable in the case other than a great case,5,love it,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",0.9079
6,A1Y4MY6KYVUTIA,7214047977,S.K.W. S.K.W.,"[0, 0]","It's her favorite color and it protects her kindle. She has no complaints. Covers the power button, but not a big deal.",5,Wife loves it,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",0.3192
7,A2QO4JQX6MTS75,7214047977,SUE,"[1, 1]",the only downside to this was the cover covers up the on off button and the camera and I have to take it out of the cover to use the camera if I had known this I would have chosen a different one,4,fits well and great color,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",-0.25
8,AVLWZUZ594UT4,7214047977,Sweet potato,"[0, 0]","I bought this at the same time I bought the Kindel Fire HD 7. It is exactly as pictured, the fit was great, and the price was right. The reason for the 4 stars is the cut outs for the volume and power buttons are on the edges of case but the actual buttons are located on the back of the Kindel. You can't access either button while the case is on. Apparently when Kindel upgrades a tablet they don't change the name or add a number to it like Apple does with the iPad. I went back and searched for clues in the description that this was for a different version Kindel and did not find anything. If you want a decent case and you don't want to pay a lot for it, this is the one but just make sure it's designed for the HD 7 Kindel version you are buying.",4,Be careful,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",0.1699
