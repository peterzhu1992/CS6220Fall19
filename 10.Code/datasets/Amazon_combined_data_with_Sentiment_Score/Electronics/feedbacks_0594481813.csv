1,A3HICVLF4PFFMN,594481813,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]",bought for a spare for my 9&#34; Nook HD and it fit perfectly. Very satisfied with the price much less than on the BN site,5,great fit,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",0.6236

3,A2QBZA4S1ROX9Q,594481813,Jake,"[0, 1]","This is a good beefy 2 amp charger, but it covers two outlets on a power strip. It's ok in a regular wall outlet. The best thing is it uses a standard USB connector so it can charge more than just a Nook (I have a Kindle Fire HD+).",3,It Works,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",0.3186
4,ANY6JUFM0GH8U,594481813,J. Clement,"[2, 2]","I lost my B&N original cable. I looked around for an new one. I tried a different, cheaper model but it didn't fit my device properly so back to the drawing board. I ordered this one. I am satisfied. It works exactly as expected and fits perfectly. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a spare or in lieu of the original usb cable adapter.",5,Great replacement for original power cable,1394323200,"03 9, 2014",0.1785
5,AT09WGFUM934H,594481813,John,"[0, 0]","It does 2A and charges a DEAD Nook in a few hours. It does so with a LOT of heat, compared to most wall worts. I have a dual charger where 1 port is 2.1A and the other is 1A for total output of 3.1A that doesn't run as hot as this. And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubIt does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging. I guess it's better to have it at the plug.",3,This is the oem charger you get with the nook hd+,1377907200,"08 31, 2013",-0.0817
6,AGAKHE014LQFU,594481813,Nicodimus,"[3, 5]","Go to Target or Barnes and Noble instead, and pay $25 (which is still a huge markup, considering they make the thing for 50 cents.) This is the worst option if you need one of these. It's price gouging, pure and simple.",3,$45 for a power cord? Good luck with that.,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",-0.0085
7,A1S6B5QFWGVL5U,594481813,T. Vaughan,"[2, 2]","Works well, a little pricey I think for a charging cable, but then again, not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement",4,Good replacement,1372291200,"06 27, 2013",0.2223
