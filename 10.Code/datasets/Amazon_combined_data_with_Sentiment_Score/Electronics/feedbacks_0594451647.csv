2,AAZ084UMH8VZ2,594451647,D. L. Brown A Knower Of Good Things,"[0, 0]","This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)",5,A Perfdect Nook HD+ hook up,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",0.3214
3,AEZ3CR6BKIROJ,594451647,Mark Dietter,"[0, 0]","This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7&#34; to my HDTV through the HDMI cable. This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port. It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have. Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series. It will not work with a standard Nook.",4,A nice easy to use accessory.,1405036800,"07 11, 2014",0.4371
4,A3BY5KCNQZXV5U,594451647,Matenai,"[3, 3]",This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV. Nice they made such a device.,5,This works great but read the details...,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",0.3805
