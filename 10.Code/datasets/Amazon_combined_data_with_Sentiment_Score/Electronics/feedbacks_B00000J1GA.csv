I work with computers andI wasn't sure how it would work with all of the electrically noisy equipment around us but it works great!

1,A1TAFEUKHIFV6L,B00000J1GA,Amit Patel,"[0, 0]","[December 2000]I really like these headphones. I also tried the Sony RF950-RK, which is in a comparable price range.What I liked about Sony: longer battery life (15 hr instead of 6 hr); there's a stand on which you can hang your headphones; there's an auto on-off feature that saves battery life.What I didn't like about Sony: you have to take the batteries out and put them into a recharger unit (I was expecting to just hang the headphones on the stand and have them recharge, like the Palm Pilots do in their cradles); when I tilt my head forward (at my desk, since I use these at work), they slide off.What I like about Advent: the sound is slightly better; the battery recharging is easy (plug it in and it recharges); they are more comfortable than the Sonys.What I didn't like about Advent: there's no recharging stand; the tuning knob is in a really bad place (where you'd put your hands when you're putting the headphones on).I didn't really care about the range, because I'm really only using them in the same room. One thing to be aware of: the Advent instruction manual (which nobody reads) says you should plug them into the LINE OUT and not the SPEAKER OUT port. The line out has a much stronger signal (unless you turn up the volume on the sound source). There's also an adjustment knob you're supposed to use to get the signal strength up to the right level. Before I did these two things, I got a lot of noise. After I read the instructions and set up a strong signal, I had almost no noise.Overall I really love them. I can listen to music really loud without bothering my officemate, and they're comfortable enough to wear all day without trouble.[December 2003]I no longer use these headphones for day to day use. After about six months, I got too annoyed with the sound fading in and out, the increasing amount of hiss, and the random loss of stereo signal. I'm back to using regular wired headphones, this time spending only $18 on an Aiwa pair that I like. I still use the Advent wireless headphones for occasional TV viewing (where sound quality is not so important), but I wouldn't recommend them.",2,Good headphones at first; didn't last long,976579200,"12 12, 2000",0.2032
2,A204ETWOV23HO4,B00000J1GA,David J. Huber Addicted to books!,"[9, 9]","Not the highest fidelity you will ever hear in a headphone, but if you aren't in a recording studio, and are just listening to music while sitting at home or cleaning, or watching the TV and want headphones so as not to disturb the neighbors, these are perfect. They have more than enough range - I can even go well outside, and still hear the music just fine. They are not quite five stars, though, due to not being fully 'fi', so to speak, and for the annoying need to use another plug cord to recharge the batteries.As far as some other reviewers talking about complications with tuning, maybe I just lucked out, but I had these things tuned in about three seconds. I've also never lost a signal randomly, or had the tuning slowly go out of phase as some others complained. I will say, though, that the tuning knob on the headphones is right next to the volume knob, and it's very easy to accidentally bump the tuning knob when adjusting the headphones, or when one wants to adjust the volume. But this is a minor complaint (though I would like to see advent begin to put the tuning knob on the side opposite the volume, or in some other less easily accesible spot).The lows are good, the highs are good, and the ear cushions are very comfy, even for my large head, for extended periods. The cushions I find to hold in heat from my ears and cause sweating (sorry if that's gross, but you need to know this stuff to be informed). I've always had that problem with all cushioned headphones since many, many ages ago, and so is not a problem with just these headphones, but the Advents cause it sooner than others I have owned - they make a very airtight seal around your ears.For the price, and for the built-in rechargable batteries, these are an excellent deal in my opinion, and I've enjoyed having them and using them, and have just ordered another pair so that my partner and I both can use them to watch movies with explosions and/or loud orchestral soundtracks late at night.",4,Pretty darn good,1012608000,"02 2, 2002",0.3399
3,A18PDUB7HSEP10,B00000J1GA,Jason Daniels,"[3, 3]","Fine sound, good reception over a decent range (looks like I can get around the yard without them making any big complaints), comfortable.I would say that the fidelity is only slightly less than the earbuds I'm used to. And the separation is better than I expected. There is a fair amount of hiss if no music is on, but I'm pretty picky and I think its totally tolerable.",4,Nothing wrong with these at all...,1071792000,"12 19, 2003",0.5456
4,AI7FG0JAGX77B,B00000J1GA,Larry,"[17, 18]","Overall very pleased with the product. The phones are lightweight, comfortable, and the sound quality is good anywhere in our house &amp; yard. The quality of construction of the phones and the base unit is good. There is an ample supply of cables &amp; adapters, i.e., for plugging into a computer soundcard.",4,Advent AW770 Wireless Headphones,946771200,"01 2, 2000",0.4171
5,AWWBZZXN32I6H,B00000J1GA,Mike G,"[2, 5]","I'm not brutal with equipment, but in a few short weeks, the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side. Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep. A second convenient bedside charger would be nice. I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge. If you're a late night TV watcher, you too might call this justifiable laziness. Too many times I put them on the next night and find the battery's down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless, I'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone.",1,"Easily breakable headset, charging suggestion",1082419200,"04 20, 2004",0.1302
6,A1665GGGDM0ZPO,B00000J1GA,Neal Stevens,"[12, 12]","Terrific value for the money. Sound is very clear and warm. Upper range and midrange as good as very expensive corded phones and speaker systems. The bass is not muddy, but it is less pronounced than with good speakers or corded phones. But the overall sound is still excellent.Requires a good deal of adjustment and fiddling to get the best sound and longest transmition range out of it. Don't set the level on the transmitter too high. You will get speaker overload. You can listen throughout your home, patio, and garage. But you generally get some bursts of static as you walk. None of these drawbacks bothers me.Best for listening to CD's. Sounds great with LP's too, but it transmits more groove wall noise and static than you are probably used to hearing from the RIAA jacks that your turntable is connected to.",5,Wireless in North Carolina,976924800,"12 16, 2000",0.2749
7,A2KAU5BF41AKHN,B00000J1GA,Tim Allison Tim Allison,"[41, 41]","These headphones are a decent wirless solution but are a tale of two realities.Reality 1 - When charged and properly tuned, they sound great; rich bass and full mid range with good highs. Their range is excellent - I have listened to music for 3-4 hours about 100 feet from the base. They are adjustable and accomodate different size heads easily.Reality 2 - The challenge of keeping them tuned and charged is not always easily accomplished. The battery setup and charging arrangement could have been done significantly better. Also unless you want to be adjusting the levels alot you need a fixed level signal. Additionally since the frequency reception is quite contingent upon battery strength, if you don't have the time or means to keep the battery charged to certain levels your performance suffers.Since I am a bit of a techno geek being mindful of charging and frequency adjustment is not a big deal, but others (like my wife) will find it a hassle.",3,A solid product but could have been better,1010707200,"01 11, 2002",0.3419
8,AOZB4GES5J7FK,B00000J1GA,T. Rourke T J Rourke,"[5, 5]",".... When I dropped them a day after getting them home, the right earpiece shattered, revealing the inside of a very cheap product. .... The description doesn't tell you that you have to tune the transmitter, then tune the headset until the signals coincide. That takes a little doing to get it right, and I find that the two parts lose each others' signal several times over the course of a couple of hours. I have to re-tune the base and the headset each time they lose each other. It also has an annoying whine most of the time also. Since last XMas, it seems like this is the only wireless headphone product in the retail stores, which is a shame because it is so bad.",1,Not a good product,991612800,"06 4, 2001",-0.3305
