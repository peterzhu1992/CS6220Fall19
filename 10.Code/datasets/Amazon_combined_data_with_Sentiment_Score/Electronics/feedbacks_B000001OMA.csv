1,A2LZ3HGE6UMSQF,B000001OMA,BSquared18,"[19, 23]","This is one of those products where you can never be completely sure if it is doing anything. But I just finished using it for the 40th time, after which it is recommended that you buy a new one, and all the players/burners I've used it on seem to be in fine working order. Whether they would be working as well if I didn't periodically clean them is impossible to say.The disc has several small brushes on it that clean the equipment's lens. It takes about one minute. There are also some additional features which I have never used.",5,Works Well as Far as I Can Tell,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",0.1211

I thought I would have to replace it, which I didn't want to because it's a high-end one, and I just love the sound quality. In the process of shopping for a new player, I came across information on CD lens cleaners. People were saying that they saved their CD player. Well, it's true! Don't believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out! My 12 year-old CD player just had a dirty lens, it wasn't broken.This one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens. Some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the CD player accepted, so that was the reason I picked this one.You put the CD in the player, in my case a 5 CD changer, and hit play. It then plays a little music and talks to you! When it's done cleaning your CD player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels. I was glad to hear that mine were indeed hooked up correctly.Tonight I put in a CD that had previously skipped or gotten stuck on a part of a song. Will wonders never cease...it played perfectly!Couldn't ask for a better product. Saved me a ton of money on a new, high end (I was going to choose a Yamaha) player.",5,Talks to you and saved me a new CD player purchase,1283644800,"09 5, 2010",0.271

Smith m.k. smith,"[0, 0]","i have my doubts as to whether these things do any good or not. never once have i had one clear up a burn problem. there is no substitute for opening the cabinet and blowing it out w/ something like a Datavac (see product on Amazon; it replaces all those cans of compressed air. one of the best investments i've ever made. i blow the dust of discs BEFORE i put them in the player. that's how most dust get's in them, on the discs!), and cleaning the lens w/ a foam tipped swab and pure alcohol.",3,Doubtful as to it's efficacy.,1404432000,"07 4, 2014",0.1484

10,A3ORB4W3GI1YFG,B000001OMA,R. Bacon,"[0, 0]","I purchased this particular disk cleaner based on the reviews I read. It cost a little more but I know Maxell to be a good brand. The directions are not clear enough for me - they assume you already understand how the thing works. Then, I couldn't get it to work. It was supposed to go in and then start talking. Of the 4 slots I tried it in it only worked inone AND it wouldn't come out without tweezers that scratched the disk. I have a Bose player withthe extra disk player which is a very good machine. I had some minor problems with one slot and I was assured the cleaner would take care of it. I never even got the disk to work let alone clean anything. I am afraid to put it in anything for fear I won't be able to get it out again. I don't know if this was a problem with my player but some disclaimer about not working with some players should be added more clearly and should list the brands it doesn't work with.",2,Doesn't do the job,1324771200,"12 25, 2011",0.1555

Jackson Curt,"[1, 1]","It really worked for me I noticed a difference after the first application but I actually had to run it maybe 5 times total but now no more skips! Might depend on just how dirty your lens is. Another plus is the equipment test it can also run on your system, found out my system was out of phase and I didn't know it. Just a fantastic product get it!!Tom",5,Worked For Me,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",-0.0765
