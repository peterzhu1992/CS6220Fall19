1,A3D1YKQZN1YZXM,7507825604,Dandan,"[0, 0]","I bought 4 of these for my test equipment - they got the job done. Though the screw on one of these did snap under medium torque... the other 3 adaptors were fine under the same torque. However, on a different one of these adaptors, I had to &#8220;open up&#8221; one of the pin holes slightly before it would accept my male cable. I would probably buy again.",4,They get the job done...,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",0.1211
