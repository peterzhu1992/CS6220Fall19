It stays there and does fall off. You would think it was made for it! I just thought that was super cool.",4,It works!,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",0.3868

I thought the cost was a little high, especially since there are many other less expensive ways to set white balance (in camera settings, grey card, coffee filters...don't laugh, I did this and it was actually the next best thing to the Expodisc). Well, I bought my Expodisc and I am a convert to the church of Expodisc. This thing is awesome. It gets me perfect WB every time, whether I'm using natural light, bounced flash, strobes, or a combination of all different kinds of light. I have never once had to change the WB in post and my photos look awesome SOOC. You can also use the Expodisc as an incedent light meter, which is pretty awesome. I would totally buy it again.",5,Love the Expodisc!,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",0.4277
3,A1R87GD4CLPKTK,B000006OQ8,Randall Stewart,"[6, 7]","I bought the current Expodisc to replace an earlier model recently stolen. The old model seemed overpriced, but it was hand-made in a low volume production. Current models made by new owners are priced about 170% more than the old, for which you get a fancy box and a few instructions on a CD rather than on a peice of paper - big deal. However, the new models have a lens mounting arrangement which is much superior to the prior model and much more expensive to make. As to function, nothing really replaces an Expodisc if you need one for white balancing a color photo exposure. I use mine to shoot grey color negatives to automate traditional color printing. I have no experience as to whether they provide superior white balancing in digital systems as claimed, but logically they should do so. Unless you plan to be very exacting about color reproduction in your color printing, the excessive cost of an Expodisc versus the marginal benefit seems questionable. If you Photoshop your pictures to death, you will get no value from this item.",5,"Expodisc: practically unique function, but pricey",1225584000,"11 2, 2008",-0.1102

Just place in front of lens, depress shutter button to focus and light meter, then remove and shoot. Images look much better now.",4,Works good.,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",0.1864
