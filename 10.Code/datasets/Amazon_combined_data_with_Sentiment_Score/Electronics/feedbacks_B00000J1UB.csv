4,A2NB2E5DXE319Z,B00000J1UB,S. Lionel,"[4, 4]","My favorite uncle, now in his 90s, hangs on to an old 386 PC running DOS even after I bought him a new PC. He uses both. But he has also hung on to old keyboards he loves, including a pair of keyboards so old that they have the old PC/AT style keyboard connector. He wanted to use one of them with his new PC that has USB inputs only (I had previously bought him a PS/2 keyboard to USB adapter so he could use his *other* beloved, only slightly newer, keyboard.) He called me asking if I could find a way to get his old big round plug keyboard with the new PC.This Belkin F2N017 adapter was just what he needed (combined with the aforementioned PS/2-USB adapter). I had it sent to him and he called me a few days later, with delight, saying that the adapter worked perfectly, adding that he was astonished anyone still made components for devices as old as he was using.",5,Simple but does the job,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",0.4309
