0,A3QPWNKTUC8N2B,1400532736,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","I bought this ereader and the Amazon Kindle ereader at the same time, so I could compare both together. After about a week I gave the Amazon ereader to my nephew and I kept the Nook. I am left handed, so holding things in my left hand feels natural to me. I really like how this can be held in the left hand and still have access to forward and back page turn buttons. Also, I like that it has a touch screen in addition to the physical buttons as well to turn pages. Also, and this was the biggest reason I kept the Nook. It has a more natural feel in the hand to me. My thumb rest comfortably next to the screen will reading. Overall, in my opinion this is a better ereader then the others out there.",5,My favorite ereader...,1398729600,"04 29, 2014",0.4335
1,AXL5F6RXDQMEW,1400532736,Amazon Customer review2u,"[5, 7]","No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service. I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N. So if you look at the numbers and see that Kindles far outsell Nooks, B&N's misnamed Customer Service is likely at least part of the reason.",1,Barnes and Noble Customer Service?

Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading, one should be able to use it for a month on one charge. My battery already lasts only 2 - 2 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit won't start due to a low battery level, requiring recharging. This is either a false claim on the part of B & N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality. I've used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years; if this thing suffers from a battery problem, then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago.

4,A2GZBPJ1HTFM67,1400532736,Daniel Kwok,"[0, 0]","Personally, I'm a kindle fan. But I got the Nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries. The layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle, as on the kindle, pressing the home button brings us back to the library. On the Nook, the home button opens a menu, then you need to select the options. Also, if you sort the books by &#34;Recent&#34; it does not show the most recently read books in order, but still displays books in order of &#34;recently downloaded&#34;, not a useful function.But on a positive note, the Nook combines the touch facilities and button control (to turn the pages) of both the Kindle Touch & normal kindle. The borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your PC, then imported onto the Nook via Adobe Digital Editions. A bit of a hassle, but a good option which Kindles do not offer. Overall, it's a good companion to Kindle, especially if you wish to borrow library books.",5,A good reader that works well to borrow public library e-books,1402444800,"06 11, 2014",0.2062
5,A14QFQFF3ZX575,1400532736,Kamiyama,"[2, 10]","I need to buy a gift for my mother's birthday and I know she likes to read books while on break at her job. I thought the Nook would be a great gift for her, after reading reviews here on Amazon that it can download and read free ebooks from library sites. Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks. Claiming that a device has a functionality that it in fact does not have, is a really despicable thing to do.If you don't mind a wireless device owning a copy of your credit card, and throwing money at it to read books, then the Barnes & Noble Nook is right for you. If you are looking for an easy to use Ereader for library ebooks, STAY AWAY!",1,don't listen to the liars,1368489600,"05 14, 2013",0.3741

What I love about Nook more than kindle , that I could pick any Russian book, magazine on Internet download on my computer , convert to PD format and download on Nook + I could pick on Nook any size of letters for comfortable reading ..

Other PD format books have so small size of letters , only if you zoom text , which I find uncomfortable Like I said with Nook no problem.

The rate it which the words draw on the screen is a little slow sometimes and about once a month it freezes up. The only thing that unfreezes it is pushing the reset button for about 20 seconds.***Update*** About a month after the warranty expired, the screen froze up permanently. I haven't been able to figure out anything that will make the touch screen work again and when I called tech support, the only advice they could give me was to do a hard reset which isn't working to unfreeze the screen anymore.

9,A3L9NGPTBJBQEL,1400532736,Po Po,"[2, 3]","Aside from various problems with this since the beginning, now I have to charge this Nook every time I want to read. It is said to hold a charge for 8 weeks with the wifi off, but even if I only read for 10 minutes, the next day I have to charge it again because the battery is too low. I've tried 3 different chargers to no avail. Instructions say to leave the Nook on when not in use, so I do. It's absolutely maddening when I return home from a stressful day of work and just want to sit on my porch to read for a while to unwind and get some cool air - but no, I have to charge the fricking Nook AGAIN and can't use it outside until it's been charged for a long time - and then have to deal with this frustration the next time I want to read.This Nook is crap and the service by Barnes & Noble and the seller were both zero - no service whatsoever, with each party passing the responsibility onto the other.Also, why is it that although the Nook screen or buttons often have to be pressed very hard to turn a page, when the Nook is closed to carry to my car or somewhere the slightest pressure changes the page or screen so I have to remember or write down what page I left off at???This Nook takes all the joy out of reading.",1,battery charge doesn't last more than an hour os so,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",-0.2328

11,AUHT4M1W3G7PJ,1400532736,Tedward Geek,"[8, 10]","I'll be writing this review in stages, as I hit stopping points.Lightweight, nice screen, cute, low-profile buttons around the rim. Touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone 4s. Includes cable that has a standard USB a jack that plugs into just about everything: the computer, my hub, and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargers.This device is hard directed for easy setup. Too hard. There should be a way to accept the TOU and get to using the device. Forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planning.Wifi - This is the stupidest thing about this device. Once you charge it up, you turn it on, it asks for you to agree to terms, then it goes through wifi setup. Note, you must HAVE wifi, AND connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue. At this time, I'm stuck. I'm in a town with limited wifi options, so it's not like I can just select a local hotspot. Until i register the device, I have a brick.I have an old Netgear Router 802.11g&b; with wep and wpa protection. The nook is capable of wpa2 security, but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely. Strange thing was that I could get past the password, but it still would not connect to the internet (I checked the setup with my iPhone and everything worked fine). Customer service had very few answers and only about 3 steps for me to take to fix the problem. I tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the Nook runs on an 802.1x EAP network. Upon googling it, this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems. Next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try again.However: As soon as the thing charged and turned on, it showed up on my desktop and I was able to upload screensavers, books, documents, etc. The device has a VERY small available memory, (about 250Mb), so text only books can be loaded, but not large PDFs (I bought this to enjoy the Modernist Cuisine series, 300Mb+ PDFs). I had an old version of Calibre that worked right away.I'll change this review and maybe the two stars rating once I have something more than an expensive SD card reader to play with.UPDATE (after a stop at Denny's)Okay, sure enough, Once in a local restaurant with free wifi, I was able to connect, register and start using my nook. I made sure I had a couple books on it when I left, so I was able to read a chapter before I paid the check.In good light, this screen is beautiful. The characters are crisp and clear, it's easy to read, and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts, size and margins. In lower light, the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than, say, a printed sheet of paper. Still, in my apt with only a 60 watt light illuminating the room, it's still pretty easy to read.You get two choices on how the side buttons function. Personally, I like the lower one turning the page forward; because I tend to hold it in the lower corner, cupped in my hand. However, you can swipe the screen to turn pages, too.The OS on the nook is a little simpler than, say the kindle fire. And maybe that's why I like it better. On this device, books are books are books. They can be epubs, pdfs, purchased or uploaded, they all go the same place, and they all end up in the same list. Nothing grinds my gears more than having to look 2-3 places for things based on where you bought them, or some other phantom difference established by the designers (or worse, the marketing department - I'm looking at you Kindle). The down side to this that if you have a large ebook library, you are pretty much stuck using the search function. There doesn't seem to be a way to organize books any other way. [checking online....] Oh crap, they have this whole shelf system built in. Damn, scratch that organizational thing, I'll get back to ya there.Screen Savers.Forget about those fancy things on your PC, the nook's idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps. The default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors. nice, you can also choose nature scenes. But, remember I said that you could upload directly to the nook? Well, here ya go. Create a folder with the name of your screen saver set, upload some 800x600 pics (jpg/png formats) in portrait mode and Voila! You have your own custom set. I went to nook.com and downloaded a bunch of Str Trek Geeky stuff at first, but then realized I could just take a few snapshots and convert them to 16 greys myself. Now I have a folder of a dozen of MY pictures as the screen saver. Very nice. Kinda like having an image viewer as well.Calibre.Getting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze. I bought a 16gb micro SD on sale and added it. The card mounts on the desktop separately, but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly. So, when you put stuff on the device, you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card. Come to think of it, a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well. Put your SF collection on this card, classics on that one, etc. Fun.Oh, also, once I got the registration completed at Denny's I went into settings and disconnected the wifi. It's been operating in that mode ever since. So, only that first time is needed.Adding two more stars for all the juicy goodness. I'll play around with it a while and see if we can get it to 5. No real serious problems yet.UpdatePDFs - Okay, so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document. This strange little device actually reads the text (easiest way to save formatting = text + format), and produces it in standard format. It's a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experience.Micro SDI think my real problem with this device was getting a huge SD card for this then thinking I had to fill it with a whole library. Bah! Granted, those 6 really large PDFs need some room, but I could have fit them all on a 2 Gb card and still had plenty of room to spare. *sigh* All that room meant I could have 100s of books on the device. Think: Tim Taylor More Power! {grunt grunt}Shelves. The device keeps track of the shelves internally, so it's not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computer's search function to organize. you MUST go through your entire library, no search functions, one book at a time to add to shelves. Great if you know what you're looking for, but not all sets start with Lord of the Rings 1: ....If you buy this, don't get an external card right away. the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff. Shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and such.I won't be exploring the B&N; store for a while (a Long while). I have a massive library to work through first. So look elsewhere for those reviews. I've heard the store is mighty nice though.No ads, easy to use, a joy to read. This, my final entry sees that last star moving up the device. Take heed of the speedbumps I've experienced and enjoy this cute little reader. Now, I just need a case..... :)ANOTHER UPDATE: Months later and I've read a small library on this thing. It's a delight. but I still find myself avoiding PDFs a lot because of the disorientation. Also: to the 2 people who did NOT find this review helpful - Bite me.

12,A3NB5CY9PWKWGD,1400532736,whydoesitmatter,"[5, 6]",I bought this directly from barns and noble. I get books from the library on my computer and that works good. The battery life is very good and the screen is very responsive. This is better then the kindle because it has expandable memory and accepts all popular formats for eBooks. The one complaint I have is that when you read PDFs you do not get the dictionary features and some of the writing is weirdly spaced. That's not what I bought it for so it does not matter to me. It has survived many months in public high school so it is very durable. I have of course bought it a protective case though. Barns and Noble ebooks are cheaper then regular books by a couple of dollars.,5,Love it,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",0.3145
