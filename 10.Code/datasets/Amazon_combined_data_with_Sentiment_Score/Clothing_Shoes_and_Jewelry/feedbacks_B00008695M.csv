Those are two of my favorites and since it is an old color, they are not likely to be reissued. I just thought I would let you know. Sorry.",5,"too bad, so sad...",1380931200,"10 5, 2013",0.1914

The length is perfect for me, although I'm 5'8&#34; and it comes a bit below my knees. The flowers are very feminine. Choose purple and save some money!",5,A bargain,1379203200,"09 15, 2013",0.3416

9,AK3U6ZMVPC2EP,B00008695M,Kim barbiedreamer,"[8, 8]",The sapphire color was the only option in my size 1X. Not crazy about the color in person. The fabric and construction is good quality.

I usually order nightgowns one size larger, so I have room to move when I sleep, but this nightgown is very roomy.

14,A23GQ7TKMHL6RY,B00008695M,Nanc,"[0, 0]",The perfect quality of Shadowline tricot is tops in the business. There is no other that compares. I'm replacing 20 year old Shadowline gowns just because after 20 years they're a bit discolored - that's it - the fabric stays as perfect 20 years later as it was day one. Excellent product & here an excellent price.,5,Shadowline product is the best,1389571200,"01 13, 2014",0.4698
15,A26K3T6L5NYO7L,B00008695M,PennyPincher,"[1, 1]","I have worn these gowns for close to 20 years. I like how they are made without any itchy lace or scratchy seams, how they make rolling around in bed easy, and that the fabric is a better quality than any other nylon nightgown I ever owned. I also like the &#34;flutter&#34; sleeve especially now that my upper arms are not what they used to be, it is nice to have them covered but not constricted by a traditional sleeve.I knew that the Shadowline brand had been sold in recent years, so I was a little concerned about the quality having changed. I just bought 2 in the magenta color since it was new (for me anyway) and was delighted to find that the quality remains. I have always gone for the darker colors since they seem to afford just a little more modesty than the pastels.",5,Happy that they are still the same quality!,1388188800,"12 28, 2013",0.2903

That might be ok (frankly, it wouldn't bother me - sounds nice and comfortable), but it's not for her.If you are questioning among the reviews whether it really is too sheer, I can say that at least in the pink and at least for my mom, it is.",3,"Bought as a gift, recipient said it was too sheer (in the pink)",1314403200,"08 27, 2011",0.2763
