Tried to see if they fit when they arrived and they did albeit they were a bit baggy in the buttocks.Thought maybe they would shrink a tiny bit and be perfect after laundering. Cold water, delicate wash cycle with organic soap and then inside line dry. I'm still kind of shocked that they shrank so much.I would need to order a size larger than normal to get perfect fit.",3,Shrinks one size even with cold water delicate wash and line dry.,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",0.4955

My one big problem with these panties is that they are perfumed. Seriously, whose idea was it to scent women's underwear?? Why is this necessary? Jockey, do you also scent men's underwear, or are women just particularly stinky? And why would they think we would like it?? I've washed them 3 times now, soaked them overnight in a borax and vinegar mixture, and they still smell. I'm worried that I could get a UTI from the scent if I wear them. As long as they keep using perfume in their underwear, I will not purchase Jockey panties again.",2,Why are they perfumed?,1378252800,"09 4, 2013",-0.0435

However, these size 4 fit her very well. I was concerned, since I ordered online and couldn't hold them up to put my eyes on them before I bought them. She really likes the prints and when she tried them on she said they felt more like a bathing suit bottom. That's good, since bathing suits need to fit your body kind of tight.

I was unsure what size to buy. I have washed them, and they shrunk a little i think, but not much. They fit very well, do not ride up, and are very comfortable. As for the reviewer who thought they come up too high and show over her pants, I suggest her pants are waaaay too low :-). if these show, she may have bought them too big, or her pants are so low, she is at risk of exposing her doo da! I am here to buy more today.Update: Liked so much, I bought 2 more packages. I bought a size 5 in black and a 4 in white. Don't see much difference. Jockey sends a coupon with the first order.

20,A14DR2RP5PAKNS,B00008ID39,Laura,"[7, 8]","I need 100% cotton panties, but finding something low rise that did not show above my pants has proven nearly impossible. I have tried Hanes and other Jockey bikinis, and found them NOT low rise even when they claimed to be. Elance in the black color has been the lowest rise of all and works ok for both jeans and working out. They are not as sexy as I had hoped for, but at this point, I'll take what ever I can get. They are comfortable, true to size and of good quality.This was originally a 4 star review. And the BLACK color I ordered still is, see above. However, I also ordered the pink/ivory/peach color combination because I loved the black so much. I was disappointed. I ordered the same size, and the package and tags say bikini, but they do not fit like the same pantie. They are baggy and the rise is much higher than the black, by 1.5 inches (AFTER washing in hot water and drying on high temp). These are not low rise as the description and box claim. These panties show above my MID rise jeans (when standing, I do not have to sit for them to show), and I don't mean they peak. At least 3/4 of an inch shows in the back. In my opinion, these fit like high cut briefs, not low rise bikinis. I have tried so many styles to try to find LOW rise, 100% cotton underwear. I thought I had found something close enough to work in the black. This other color just doesn't cut it for me, and I am now hesitant to order more of the black. Will they fit like the first set I bought? Or will it be more wasted money? I will keep this order to wear while working out. They won't show under my karate uniform, but I have yet again wasted money one something that does not live up to its description or my expectations. I don't think expecting consistency between colors is too much to ask. I mean come on, a 1.5 inch difference in the rise?UPDATE: I have since ordered a package of white and a package of gray shades. The package of white was, again, larger and higher in the rise, not as bad as before, only about 0.5 inch difference, but enough that the fabric bunched and wrinkled because the fit was too large. The gray shades were perfect fit per the size chart, just like the black. Both sold and shipped by Jockey. Don't know why the lighter colors would be larger, but I'm going to stick with ordering the darker colors.",3,Black color almost perfect - peach/ivory/pinkNOT,1270857600,"04 10, 2010",0.044

Now, I found them online and I am back wearing them. They are ALL cotton-therefore breathable and comfortable besides looking good on you as they are nicely-styled (read sexy, the picture with model's tummy facing the right does them more justice). My dermatologist recommends all-cotton panties. And these are that and look great..NO granny panties! The cotton-encased elasting band is VERY comfortable, keeps its elasticity even when the product wears out finally and protects skins afflicted with latex intolerance (my problem) or allergy.

Pant legs swim on me, yet they fit at the waist. These undies fit at the waist and in the buttocks but like all of them I buy, the leg openings are too large & with these, the leg opening elastic is too stretchy. That makes them ride up. I have now bought approximately a dozen different brands & styles. I am going to keep at it until I find ones that fit 'teenage' legs. I have an APPLE SHAPE BODY, meaning same size legs & butt I had in my 20's, but all the weight I've gained over the years going to my middle. Ugh! That's why I still wear bikini undies. They fit below the belly fat role. But I still need to cover privates. These do not work on my body type. I suspect they'd be great on pear shape beautiful women. So far the ONLY undies I've found that fit (some work when you put them on but stretch out during the day), are 'Barely There Women's Flex To Fit Bikini Panty' (you may want to buy one size larger than your size if you are on the upper side of your size). I hope this helps others. Extra note, I loved the fabric & feel on my body.
