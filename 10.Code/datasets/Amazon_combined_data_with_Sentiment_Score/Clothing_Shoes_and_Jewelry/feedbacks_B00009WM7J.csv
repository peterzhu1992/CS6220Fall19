They are also extremely comfortable for boots. I cannot wait to wear these through the Michigan winter and see how they hold up!",5,Perfect for women with little feet !!!,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",0.4215

The price was also a plus since the adult sizes are a good 30 dollars more expensive. I am a women's 7.5 and got a kids 6 and it fit perfectly with a little bit of wiggle room.Timberland boots are making a comeback in the style trend. Numerous celebrities are pairing them up with skinny jeans or tights and they just add a nice touch to any wardrobe. They are very attractive and you can't go wrong with them for casual wear.Something I must not is that your must wear thick socks with these. I tend to get blisters on my feet if I don't. I must also not that these boots will wear down your feet. After wearing them for 8 hours walking a good bit, my feet felt like they were about to fall off from the rest of my body. If you are doing a lot of walking around you might need to reconsider your desire to buy these.In the end, I am highly satisfied with these shoes. They are just great and durable!",4,Stylistic Boots! and kids prices are cheaper.,1404604800,"07 6, 2014",0.3723

We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel's or other high end stores. 99% of the time, we get her shoes, sneakers or boots, she wears them 1-2x's & complains about the fit! I'd about had it & was thinking it would cost less to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot!!!! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver ( hers anyway!) I bought NB wide $40 sneakers & she LOVES them, wearing them consistently 3-4 times a week. Snow came & we had problems...... Uggs are her fav pair yet they aren't for snow & rain :( so the hunt was on! Cheap ones, wide, xtra wide, expensive ones, ones we'd never heard of- ALL didn't fit...then, looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here- I found THESE. Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse, so I worried. I waited days, looked again, 1left in her size 5.5 wide! I grabbed em' , I was desperate! They came today- I was shaking, she was scared yet another wouldn't fit... Well Dear Lord she put them on & ran around the house smiling & yelling &#34;I LOVE EM' &#34;!! She has a EE width, yet these in just wide fit perfect! I am now looking to buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon! Made well, soft leather & the sole is flexible. A great boot-",5,One of the BEST shoes she has ever had!!,1359331200,"01 28, 2013",0.1913
4,AI6DHJ1IOI890,B00009WM7J,JoJo44,"[1, 2]",Love these boots. Have this style in about 7 colors. These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo pants. I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new. Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch. Good support.,5,"Great boots, great color",1357516800,"01 7, 2013",0.5585

They were delivered super fast and I got a really good deal on them since I bought them in children's size. I am a size 7 (sometimes a 6.5) in women's and I got these shoes in a children's size 5.5. They fit great! They're kind of heavy, so it takes a while to get used to walking in them but they look amazing. These shoes are very durable and great quality, so you can tell that they'll last for a long time.",5,they're beautiful,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",0.4951
