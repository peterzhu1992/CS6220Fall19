1,A1UL25PU5ULVBJ,B00006I551,hbthemik,"[12, 13]","I needed an everyday digital watch that I can wear to classes and gym. This one does the job very well at its kind price (can find at a cheaper price online) and looks good as well. It stays very comfortable on my wrist due to its thin and small face. I have a relatively thin wrist (Sz 6.5) so it looks proportional. I can see how this one can look a little small if you have a thick wrist but worth a try anyway. It even looked a little small on my wrist at first but I became to like the look of it as time passed.I also just switched battery on mine since the lcd looked a little weak. It's extremely easy to change the battery too. Just unscrew the 4 bolts on the back, take out the watch inside (it's one piece), open it by opening four corners, swap the battery, then put it back together. Even if you have no experience with battery changing on a watch, you will figure out easily.Overall, I'm very satisfied.The only con if I have to pick one - the light could be a little brighter. But no problem reading the time.",5,F-91W,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",0.2671

The band is the only thing that has ever broken on mine and a band cost almost as much as the watchYou can wash your hands or get caught in the rain and not worry about the watch since it is water resistant",4,Last a long time if you take care of it,1401235200,"05 28, 2014",-0.0588

This is the kind of watch you get before a trip where you don't want to risk losing, breaking or having stolen your real watch. Might also work as a kid's first watch but it might not hold up to kid-level abuse. It's cheap (in cost) because it's a cheap watch.
