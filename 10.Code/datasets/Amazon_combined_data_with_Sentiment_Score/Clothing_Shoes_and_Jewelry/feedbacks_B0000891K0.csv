But, for those of us that don't have a problem with them, it seems as though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from, and no more 'pantyhose'. Let alone NAVY. This is the real deal. I plan on buying more for my 'stash'. These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year. You get what you pay for, and these are a bargain for the quality. Love them! Thanks for carrying, Amazon.
