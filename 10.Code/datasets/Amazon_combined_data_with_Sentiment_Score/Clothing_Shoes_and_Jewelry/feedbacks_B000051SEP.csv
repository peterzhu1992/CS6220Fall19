First of all the visibility of the display is much too dark. The images of the X-Lander on the Amazon and Suunto websites have been enhanced to the point that a case could be made for false advertising. Secondly, the instructions to set the numeric values (meters vs feet, etc.) aren't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch, you have to download the full set of instructions to figure that out, then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations, that even with 20/20 vision, I had to use an illuminated magnifying glass to see, then set the values. Thirdly, the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight. It is only good for pitch black darkness...much too dim, but is probably the same as their military version, which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot! Fourth, (probably for the same reason) the alarm is not loud enough, especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing. As others have stated, it should not be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep. Fifth, the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable...too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass (which, as it turns out, I do carry while trekking). Finally, the feature navigation is not intuitive, meaning if you do not use the features and sub-features regularly, good luck with remembering how some of the functions are accessed, and turned on and off, unless you carry the instructions on your person.I am going to keep this &#34;wrist computer&#34; for trekking, but it will not be the watch on my wrist for everyday casual use. That honor will still go to my Wenger Military. Because of that, there should be a way to shut off the X-Lander (short of removing the battery) so the battery does not run down while it's in the safe...still hoping to find out how to do that...doesn't have a stem to pull out like a watch.I can not recommend the X-Lander. It is feature-rich, fairly compact and lightweight, but the issues above make it less than desirable and overpriced. The Finns need to address these issues before I buy another Suunto &#34;wrist computer&#34;.",2,Disappointed,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",0.1568
1,A2G4MGVWR20OOI,B000051SEP,D. Brown,"[0, 0]","I've had this watch for several years now and it still holds up. It is a little pricier than some of the competition from Casio and Timex. However, it offers some nice advantages over most others, with only a couple drawbacks. I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly. Not that I truly ever relied on the Comp-Baro-Alti features, because we always had other more advanced devices for that. But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times. And the basic time, stopwatch, alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros:User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do, saves money.Broad array of functions - easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years, good quartz movement.Good water resistance - not a dive watch, but it holds up well, even under several meters of water, which I've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and a large, comfortable band.Easy to read - large face, big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons:Not solar-atomic (like Casio Pathfinder) - however, battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300, but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios, but isn't too hard to figure out.Price - higher than many, but not excessive for what you get.Overall, despite the drawbacks referenced above, I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume the other Suunto models are also good.

2,A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ,B000051SEP,Jeff Edwards RadioJeff,"[19, 21]","I collect watches, and I am NOT one to shy away from big watches, and in some cases, the bigger the better. What I really love about the X-Lander is that it is big but also very light-weight. Normally when you see a wrist watch this large you have to exercise your arm quite a bit just to get used to telling time, but not so with the X-Lander. And best of all: it does WAY MORE than just tell time!Interested in knowing where you are going? How about the current temperature? Are you just the slightest bit interested in what your current altitude may be? GO BUY THIS WATCH! 'Course for those Suunto enthusiasts, this ISN'T a watch, its a Wristop Computer that just so happens to be able to tell time. Unlike the Suunto Observer which is about half the size (and more than a little extra spendy), this baby will do all that and still look great doing it. From the 3 different Suunto models I personally own, I must admit that they make a great wristop computer, or for the picky out there, watch. I mostly use mine to tell simple time, but I must say that as I drive over the mountains up to Montana or over to Oregon and Washington, it IS handy to know a few extra details just by looking down at my wrist. Oh, I almost forgot the barometer! It tracks the barometric pressure and helps you track and even predict the weather! I must say that I haven't been able to figure out the finer points of how to do that just yet, but I AM working on it.I guess if I HAD to point out one flaw, I would say that the night-glo feature it comes with isn't all that bright, and the alarm could stand to be louder -- but it IS about 5 TIMES more audible than the absolutely embarassing alarm built into the Observer. Other than these minor complaints, I whole-heartedly endorse pretty much everything manufactured by Suunto, and especially the models I own, the X6HR, The Observer and of course the X-Lander. Sylish, multi-functional and quite durable. Choose one of these models and you will no doubt be as satisfied as I am.",5,A Fantastic Gadget for those of us who like Cool stuff,1071187200,"12 12, 2003",0.2383

Taegel,"[3, 6]","This watch screams high-tech, and anyone venturing off to a comic book convention is bound to get a few nods from people dressed in Sith Lord garb and even a wicked witch or two.So it's big, real big, but cool. If you want a little more discreet, go with the Observer.The new synthetic band that has replaced the leather is a real improvement. After all, whoever heard of a sports watch with a leather band? The idea is absolutely absurd. HOWEVER, the back eyelit got chafed and worn away the first two weeks. Of course, it doesn't show, but it's annoying, especially considering this isn't an el cheapo watch.If you're into mountain biking, running, swimming, hiking, or training of any sort, this is the watch for you. It doesn't have super sports specific functionality, but in my experience I've never used stuff like that in any case, so this watch accomodates me perfectly.And women DROOL over it.

5,A3TCMJ6GKZJFBQ,B000051SEP,W. Stohler,"[0, 0]","I purchased the X-Lander Military version of this watch (all black, rubber strap). I've scraped it across several hard objects, and it has yet to show scratches. I love the compass and reverse display. You have to be careful when setting up the watch, as it is easy to change the factory defaults on the barometer. The elevation data seems to change constantly with barometric pressure, but I'm assuming that this is always the case with this type of instrument as its not tied to GPS. My chief complaint is that the buckle is hard to unfasten (acutally, the tab that holds the end of the strap in place).",4,"Great Compass Watch, So Far!",1241222400,"05 2, 2009",0.0903
