The bottom does roll under a bit but not bad just if I am lounging on the couch and up and down alot.

My ribcage actually measures at 31.5.First things first: this bra is beautiful, sexy, not the least bit trashy and I have been waiting for it to get marked down (THANKS AMAZON!!!). I purchased it in the black and its lovely. It has a lovely lace overlay and the cups are unlined. The seam you see in the pix is comfortable and doesn't telegraph through to a t-shirt/tank top. The cups give a nice rounded shape and come up high enough to not have any quad-boob or spillage after I bend over to pick up a wiggly toddler. The straps seem to do a nice job of supporting my 'girls' without cutting into my shoulders. The back has three hooks. The band is soft/not itchy and seems slightly small. I LOVE that the underwire doesn't come up too high. It hits at a very comfortable spot on the sides. For some reason, where the underwire meets in the front REALLY pinches. I really want this bra to work so I'm exchanging it for a 34D in hopes that its sister size will be a GO. Fingers crossed!UPDATE:Ordered the 34D. THe band was more comfortable (perhaps slightly loose?) but the cups gapped on the top. I must be fuller on the bottom. It made the girls point down and out. Very sad, indeed. Sending it back.

36,A3UQEMYFP766JW,B00008ECKG,Nacirema,"[0, 0]","Felina makes some really great underwires, central gores, and band structures. Of the various brands of bras I have tried, Felina is the only one that creates bras that will perform to the standard that a good fitting bra should on me: stay on with the central gore flush with the breastbone, cups around the breasts, and underwires against the ribs under the breasts WITHOUT the straps on shoulders or band fastened. Seriously, the only brand. They seem to have the perfect structure for people with large, firm, dense, close-set breasts on a narrow frame. I've been fond of various Felina bras in the past. Unfortunately, the cup fabric does not quite perform quite as well. Felina bras tend to expect the vertical center line of your breasts to be farther toward your armpits than they are on me. This seems really odd to me given how well the underwires fit and lay flat. It causes some sagging at the top of the cups and any seaming or cup fabric structure to not line up properly with the breasts. This particular bra has the added drawback of having weird fabric. It's a stretchy mesh with either lace or stitching of some sort in a lace-like pattern. The mesh stretches and conforms to your breasts while the lacy detail prevents the fabric from moving and conforming. Unless you're toting basketballs around, this causes some weird indentation effects where the lacy detail is.

I got fitted for Felina bras and was told that I am a 32DDD in their bras. When I tried the bra on in store, it fit perfectly so I decided to order on Amazon because the store price was way more expensive. This bra has so much space in the bust area that I cannot possibly wear it as the 'girls' will jiggle with any step that I make. Terrible!",2,Provides no support,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",0.093
