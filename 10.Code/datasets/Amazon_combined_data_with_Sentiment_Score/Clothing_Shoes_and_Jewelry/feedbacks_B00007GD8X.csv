0,A16TDHT7MD010,B00007GD8X,Amazon Customer WoolTales,"[1, 2]",Buxton doesn't seem to have the quality that it used to. I do like the organizational aspect of it and the room for a cell phone. The edging where the credit cards slide in is unfinished and I don't think it will wear well.,3,It's okay.,1310083200,"07 8, 2011",0.311
1,A343596NWTO84W,B00007GD8X,Anna,"[0, 0]","This is a very useful bag and is as described. The only caveat is the leather - it's rather stiff and not very good quality. That said, it's a bargain for the price.",4,Practical,1375574400,"08 4, 2013",0.1028
2,A37T9JX54FSUGX,B00007GD8X,C. Barker,"[0, 0]",I LOVE this bag/bilfold! It fits in my compact little purse...but doubles as a purse in itself. What could be more perfect?,5,Perfect!,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",0.4495
3,AMZTJYL4KTXI4,B00007GD8X,Deborah C.,"[0, 0]","I was looking for a bag that was small enough that I wouldn't have to carry on my shoulder or would be too heavy (I have a medical condition). This bag had enough space for all my important credit cards, and a handy one for my driver's license and a mirror next to it. It has a change compartment in the back, also a compartment for bills and another zippered compartment on the inside. On top of that, there is space to fit my cell phone, lipstick, nail file, and it could accommodate a couple more items (small though). It has a small hand strap that pulls out from inside the bag and a long strap if you wanted to use it as a shoulder bag which can easily be taken off. The leather is quite soft and the bag itself looks quite classy. The only complaint I would have is that the snap that closes the bag can be hard to close, but it is very secure. i would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a small bag that accommodates all your important stuff.",5,Perfect little bag,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",0.3971

5,A1BUXI30VSG51W,B00007GD8X,Happy,"[0, 0]",I bought this purse as a backup because I like the pockets and various compartments and don't like to carry a large purse around with me. I also like that it has a strap that I can put around me and there I go out shopping without worrying about where my purse is,5,Back up purse,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",0.324
6,A2ZXDE5XN4HW5O,B00007GD8X,HC Messenger,"[12, 12]","This is the fifth Buxton of this style I've owned. They are a grab and go item when running errands/shopping. Because I tote my own canvas and insulated shopping bags to the farmers' market and grocery stores, I no longer carry a hand bag/purse. The Buxton clutch is tossed into the shopping bag.As to layout, credit card slots are in perfect location, easy to see and access. I use the checkbook holder for folding money (the little that I carry). There's a zipper compartment for plenty of coin, spare key fob is attached inside, mirror is attached on flap, and there's room for cell phone, lipstick, kleenex, what have you.I have tried other higher end wallets which look good but can't touch the organizational ability of this clutch. I use it without the easily removable strap.I would be hard pressed to find the quality and convenience at this price anywhere else. I've owned black, beige, brown, navy, and red, and they are all equally attractive (don't look cheesy).",5,Outstanding organizer clutch,1374883200,"07 27, 2013",0.2238
