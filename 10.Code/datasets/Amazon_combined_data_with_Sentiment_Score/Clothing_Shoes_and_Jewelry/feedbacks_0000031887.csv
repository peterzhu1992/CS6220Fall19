3,A8U3FAMSJVHS5,31887,Caromcg,"[0, 0]","We bought several tutus at once, and they are got high reviews. Sturdy and seemingly well-made. The girls have been wearing them regularly, including out to play, and the tutus have stood up well. Fits the 3-yr old & the 5-yr old well. Clearly plenty of room to grow. Only con is that when the kids pull off the tutus, the waste band gets twisted, and an adult has to un-tangle. But this is not difficult.",5,"Adorable, Sturdy",1398556800,"04 27, 2014",0.1701

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I haven't washed it yet- so I don't know how it will hold up... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus (we got one in light pink also), especially spinning and running in them :) She's on the little side, so my concern was that it would be too big, but the fit is perfect!
