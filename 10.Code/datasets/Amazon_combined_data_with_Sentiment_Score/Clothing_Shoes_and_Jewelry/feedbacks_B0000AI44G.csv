2,ATXQA678MIRJV,B0000AI44G,Deborah Taliaferro,"[0, 0]","This was purchased for my 4 year old to wear when we took him to see the new Superman movie. The quality is what you would expect from a packaged halloween costume that is meant to be worn for one day. The S on the chest started peeling on one corner after a few days of wear. My son is obsessed with super heros so he wears this costume around the house almost daily. The stitching for the velcro on the belt came loose and had to be repaired. For the price I paid for this, we have got our money's worth out if it.",3,What you expect from a costume,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",0.0471
3,A3IHZ1NDIW7VWN,B0000AI44G,Grandma J,"[71, 73]","I bought this for my 5 year old grandson and he couldn't have been happier! I picked this one because it isn't padded in the chest. I wanted the costume to be comfortable since my grandson likes to wear his costume day and night. I actually ordered both the medium and the small. The sizing on the package of the small said ages 3-4. That made me uncertain if it would fit since my grandson is tall for his age. Just to be safe I ordered the medium too. It turned out the small was a perfect fit with room to grow so I returned the medium which was too big. If your child loves to dress up, I'm sure this will be a hit!",4,A big hit!,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",0.2501

Maybe different styles of the same costume and the one you get depends on which year's model Amazon grabs out of the bin? Either way - grandson loves it! I bought a small and was surprised to find it fits both the 3.5 and the 5.5 year olds - one loose and one tight!Seems to be good quality - especially for a kids halloween costume.",5,Up in the air...,1350950400,"10 23, 2012",0.3023

6,A3DQDW7N0TRCVH,B0000AI44G,Mandy,"[0, 0]","We wanted the costume that didn't have all the bulk in it. This was perfect. My son is 4 and it was a little big, but I just think- hey, he can wear it to play in for a good year or so. He'll get lots of wear out of this. It would be nice if the boot covers fit tighter, but they were good enough! Easy on and off...we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm, so there's your muscle bulk, if that's what you want.",5,"Cute and cozy, like it should be for a superhero!",1355184000,"12 11, 2012",0.4604

Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume. This showed up without a cape and was a &#34;Super Hero&#34; suit. The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off, and were not even straight lines. Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by.",1,Worst purchase ever from amazon,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",0.0033
