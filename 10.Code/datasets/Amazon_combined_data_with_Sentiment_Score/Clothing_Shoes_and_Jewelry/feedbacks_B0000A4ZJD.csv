I bought my husband a pair of white ones last summer, which--miracles never cease--he's still wearing. They're the only ones I've seen that are wide enough for him (He wears the XW.) These shoes are good for walking and playing tennis. I also wear an old pair to workout in the gym.",5,comfortable and durable,1363996800,"03 23, 2013",0.197

I'm not sure if this is the same as what I bought previously, but it seemed like it would be from the pictures. Anyway, the shiny leather squeaks a little while I walk. The sound seems to be going away over time, but it is a little annoying at first",4,A little squeaky,1393891200,"03 4, 2014",-0.0126

My husband wanted a simple, comfortable, black sneaker to wear when he does security work now and then &#34;on the side.&#34; He needed something that would be good for standing/walking long 12 hr nights and did not want something too expensive as he only does this a few times a year, for certain events. These sneakers fit the bill perfectly and were our first choice since they fit every aspect we were looking for.They are simple, but look great with anything. I have been wearing them myself for decades, but this was my husband's first pair. He was very happy with them.",5,Comfortable,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",0.5841

6,AP9NMXCEG0K1F,B0000A4ZJD,Sid Kali,"[1, 1]",The mistake was on my part. I thought I hit 10 instead of 9. Returns are always a problem. Gave to friend who wears 9. They said K-Swiss is not like older K-Swiss. Got cheaper with material and fit too snug.,3,I thought I ordered a 10 but it was a 9,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",-0.0271
