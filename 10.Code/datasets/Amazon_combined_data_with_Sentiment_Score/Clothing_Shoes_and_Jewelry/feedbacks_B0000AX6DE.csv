0,A2D1LPEUCTNT8X,B0000AX6DE,Ali Julia,"[32, 32]","I have a couple of Scrushes at my house. The one with the base is at the entrance that has stone steps, and the one without the base at the entrance that has wood steps. The Scrusher with a base allows you to put one foot on the base to hold it down, while you are cleaning the other shoe. The Scrusher without the base has to screwed down to the deck to stay in place while you are using it. You cannot use this Schrusher (without the base) without attaching it to something because as you clean your boot it will move around with with boot.The Scrusher has brushes on the bottom and the sides so it scrapes the boot from the sides as well as from the bottom. It works well on scraping off garden dirt during the summer as well as snow during the winter. The stiff brushes do a good job cleaning without damaging/scratching the shoe.I owned my Scrushes for 3 years, they stay outside all year round. The only down side is that metal parts began rusting on both of them, so I had to move the free standing Scrusher off the nice stone steps to avoid rusty stains. However the replacement steel base is sold separately so it can be replaced (to find the base search for Scrusher Boot Cleaner Base (Steel Base Only!))I am attaching several photos of my Scrusher, so you can evaluate its condition and the amount of rust yourself.Ali Julia review",5,Works well in the summer and in the winter,1304899200,"05 9, 2011",0.1582

It really does work and does the job, as long as you remember to use it.",5,"Works great, as long as your husband remembers to use it",1365206400,"04 6, 2013",-0.1366
3,AI23TS49R8G6B,B0000AX6DE,F. B. Ralph lovinlife,"[5, 6]",Problem is I put it on the ground and it moves when you put your shoe through it. It has screws to mount it but I can not use that application. I need it for anyone who passes through my gate at the backyard and it seems a bit narrow for the shoes we use. It is truly a Boot Brush with the high sides which would be fine for a work boot or sneaker but I would do better with a straight across brush since we use flip flops and sandles much of the time and the sides are too high for those type of shoes.,3,Boot scraper,1300665600,"03 21, 2011",0.0338
4,A3OXTC8MZ0DXTU,B0000AX6DE,G. Prentice,"[0, 0]",This entry way shoe brush was delivered quickly and the quality is very sturdy and well built.

6,AK6BWNWBAXS97,B0000AX6DE,M. S. Anderson bUzzbOmb,"[18, 19]","We live in a place where we often have a foot of snow on the ground for 4-5 months of the year.The good:Very sturdy and easy to install. The metal seems substantial enough to last.Cleans the gunk off boots and should easily keep the amount of snow off of our waterhog carpet at our back entry door.The bad:Rusts easily. I suspected this thing rusted rather easily looking at other peoples scrushers. I thought that I would add an extra coat of Rustoleum at the beginning of the this season to prevent it from rusting as easily. However.....When I removed the brushes it was already rusting in various spots before my new scrusher has even seen outside duty. This is not ideal and makes me feel like it is lower quality than I had anticipated.Normally, I expect that metal will potentially rust over a winter in the snow belt. The environment isn't very kind to metal things in our neck of the woods so I already do yearly rustoleum duty to slow the damage down on various metal objects I have. But,I don't expect a new item to be rusting in a few spots right when I buy it.I wish things could be made the way I imagined they were 20 years or so ago, when I was younger. It seems like powder coating should be more substantial and complete. Perhaps it is a sign of our age, but I yearn for better quality and longevity.These days, it seems that in order to give things longevity, I have to do a lot of prevention and maintenance myself. Not a big problem since I am used to it to a degree, but I hope for more.",3,Rusted already - Mostly for snow.,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",0.249

That's pretty good for a climate that gets high humidity, beaming sun, negative temperatures and snow. Very well made product. The bristle didn't seem to damage dress shoes either.",5,Sat Outside For 10 Yrs,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",0.2665
8,A1RGTSCQI1MHF2,B0000AX6DE,Torrealta torrealta,"[5, 5]","This is an excellent shoe scraper. However, to work effectively, it needs a base, which is not easy to attach. Apparently you can remove the bottom brushes and use the drill holes, which I did not figure out. I screwed a piece of scrap board into the bottom brushes from below (through the drill holes), which works fine, but requires fairly exact measurement. The board extends @ 9 inches to each side of the brush. I stand on the board with my off foot so that it is firmly anchored when I brush each shoe.The fit is very tight, which is necessary for the brush to remove debris thoroughly. I suspect that reviewers who complain of the tight fit for large shoes have not attached an anchoring board.The product would be improved by the inclusion of instructions for attaching an anchor board.Because I have a small back porch, I have to keep the apparatus a few feet away on a paved surface.",4,Must be anchored,1343865600,"08 2, 2012",0.1766
