I suppose I just don't see myself as the type of guy that wears seude shoes. I power through it though because these things are so comfortable.

This pair is on around year 3 also and the soles are completely flat in some spots now. The elastic is stretched permanently and the adhesive is coming undone around the toes. Some of the rubber is starting to deteriorate along the sides but he leather has no holes or tears. The built in plastic support around the ankle area has cracked on both shoes. Nevertheless, they are still functional and extremely comfortable. They keep my feet warm enough in the winter for casual wear but I would not dare use them for winter hiking or other winter sports for fear of frostbite. Their dry traction seems to be pretty good and wet traction is decent. Overall, these are a very good shoe.

These shoes are not light in weight; the pair (size 10 1/2D) weighs approximately 1 lb. 12 5/8 oz. The suede is a good quality and finish on these slip-ons is clean and well done. Interior seams are clean and the lining is soft and cushioned. The soles are rubber and, if wearing these on wet surfaces, help prevent slipping.Because Merrell Jungle Moc are not flexible but are somewhat wide, you may find it necessary to order a smaller size than you normally wear. My spouse wears an 11 D in Brooks running shoes and an 11D in most conventional shoes. The Merrell Jungle Moc slip-ons that fit comfortably and did not gap or slide were a size 10 1/2D. From the middle of the front to the center of the heel, the interior measurement on a 10 1/2D is approximately 11 . At the ball of the foot, the interior width is approximately 3 ; at the heel, approximately the interior width is approximately 2.Individuals having more sensitive feet may find the point at which the sole joins to the shoe, near the ball of the foot, somewhat irritating. It was for this reason that my spouse purchased Skechers GoWalk2 shoes and returned the Merrell Jungle Moc slip-ons.

Even better, I live at a ski resort and the soles on these shoes are incredible on snow and ice. I had the Merrell Shivers, which were warmer, but very slippery on ice.Merrell makes a lot of different soles. The ones I got look like they have octopus suckers on the sides and little square nubs in the center. Very bizarre looking but very sticky. These soles come on the standard Jungle Mocs.Edited 11/30/12: I just got my second pair. What a difference. As great as these shoes are they don't last forever, so treat yourself to a new pair when the soles wear down. They feel awesome again!",5,Awesome shoe,1293494400,"12 28, 2010",0.2333

These arrived and while the box said 9.5 W, the tag inside the tongue said 9.5. So now I have to wonder if they just dont put the W on the inside tag, or if they shipped the wrong product.I tried them on and WAY TOO TIGHT! Obviously these are not a proper wide size so now I have to wonder if all Merrells are a snug fit and Wide really just means Normal, or if I got the wrong product. Since no store anywhere in 50 miles of me keeps the wide sizes in stock, I will never know.They look nice and seem like they'd be comfortable if they are the right size, and I think they provide good traction on slick surfaces, but since I am returning them I didnt feel like making a trip around the block.
