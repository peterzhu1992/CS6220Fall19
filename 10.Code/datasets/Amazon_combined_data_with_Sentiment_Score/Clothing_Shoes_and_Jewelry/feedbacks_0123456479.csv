You will love this color too. If this is a gift do not hesitate. It will please even the most fussy, as I am. The price is fair if you check around as I did. Seems well made too. It is suitable for an adult though. Not meant as a toy. This is for serious jewelry lover's. Buy it.....",5,Breathtaking 5 Stars,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",0.2585

It arrived with some of the leather scratched, even though it looked like I was the first one opening the box. This particular color pink also looked pretty bad in person. The quality of this box seemed lesser than the brown one I own.I returned this pink case for a refund without a problem. Got another brown Shining Image jewelry case and it's fine!",3,Arrived with a defect,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",0.1729

My granddaughter likes the Shining Image Jewelry Box given to her for a birthday gift from Grandma. I wish the drawers were deeper for holding her many necklaces. Also, I wish the drawers had a stop, preventing the drawers from tipping contents entirely when trying to remove one piece of jewelry. My granddaughter is only five years old, so having the background knowledge of knowing when to stop the action of pulling the drawer from the base requires practice. I, on the other hand, have had lacks of years of practice with jewelry drawers, but also struggle with removing the drawer without spilling the contents.",3,Nice Size But Drawers Are A Concern,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",0.1142

Although the organization for all your jewelry is great, I'm not so sure how it will stand up to my tween daughter's use. Every inch is useable space for jewelry & very compact, which is a nice feature.",4,Great jewelry box,1388102400,"12 27, 2013",0.321
