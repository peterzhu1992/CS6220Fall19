This one is almost identical to my old one; only the color is different. It is sleek, functional, well built and even arrived earlier than anticipated.",5,Hard to Find,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",0.2379
1,AG7810PTADCTL,B00007GD9I,Cindy Cat NC catloverNC,"[0, 0]","My wallet appears to be a taupe color. The colors I would have preferred were out of stock. Having said that, there is nothing wrong with the color I got. It isn't fully leather so don't yet know how long it will last. It comes with a check book cover which can be removed. Haven't any cash, so can't tell how happy it would be in the compartments, but my credit card and insurance etc cards seem perfectly happy :). I especially like that the ID view pocket has a hole in the center which makes it much easier to get you DL out when needed.",4,Buxton Heiress Organizer- I bought the color tobacco,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",0.284
2,A1J96SUX3VFV5R,B00007GD9I,Colleen Larsen,"[0, 0]","I have had my wallet,card/ck book holder/attached coin purse for about 7 years. It is perfect for me. When my Mom saw it she loved it so of course I bought her one as a gift and she loved it. Then about 3 yrs ago her wallet was lost/stolen and she bought herself a different wallet that she didn't really like. Anyway, we all Prayed her wallet would be returned and 8 months later somebody put in in her mailbox!!!! Of course the $ was gone but her personal things were in tack.. Today she said she was looking for a new wallet because hers was a little shabby looking (mine is fine because I do 90% of my shopping on-line with Amazon. (no wear and tear shopping on line) My Mom said she looked in a few stores and wanted a wallet w/ the change purse attached and hasn't found one yet. Well of course I went on Amazon typed in buxton wallets and in 30 seconds I found our wallet. I called my Mom and just asked what color she wanted.. She said black would be just fine again.. I have just started my Christmas shopping!! Since my Mom doesn't ask for anything it's hard to buy something I know she would like AND use. So, thank you for still having this wallet on the market. I am going to fill up the credit card slots w/ store gift cards for Her. So a $21.00 plus gift turns into a $220.00 when it's opened. I also ordered the key chain/store scan card holder for her. (Mom doesn't keep her scan cards on her key chain so I think she might like it--I ordered it in red so its easy to find) I may just order myself another wallet just to save in case its discontinued... Great organizer/wallet...",5,Perfect wallet !!!!!!!!!!!,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",0.3082

For me, there is plenty of room for credit cards, ATM cards, a special place for your driver's license, etc., plus paper money and even a coin purse.What more could you ask for?",5,This does it all!,1381708800,"10 14, 2013",0.4245

6,A2R91PG1XPNO0B,B00007GD9I,Kotton Kandee not so secretshopper,"[0, 0]","Good quality, handy and functional, no bells and whistles just a leather product that works. I like the coin compartment being on the outside and available without having to open up the whole thing. I don't like the zipper coin compartments because they don't open wide enough so this is just right. And the style and color is nice/classy. It also has a check book holder inside and about 5 credit card slots. The place designated for your driver's license has a cut-out in the center of the plastic to help get hold of it to take it out when needed which is handy. It also has a zipper compartment inside to store stuff you want to keep but don't use as much. Very nice.",5,Nice,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",0.1952

I was delighted when I received the new one, and found it was exactly like my old one. No cheapening of the product at all.This is not the fanciest purse organizer that you can buy, nor the most expensive. But if you want something that just gets the job done, than this is it. I expect that this will last for years also.Definitely recommended.",5,Still the same great quality that Buxton has had for years,1385078400,"11 22, 2013",0.1032
