I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon, checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s. There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter. I can't complain about the quality of Jockey, but sizing is a totally separate issue.

18,A3SVNQ9HDLDPVH,B00008ID0B,la gata,"[1, 1]","I have bought this style in the past so I knew they would fit. So I bought more in size 9. They are comfortable but seem to run a little small. But not so small that they are uncomfortable or that I want to buy a bigger size. Just more snug. My previous purchase said they were made in Costa Rica and these say Honduras. I don't know how that makes a difference, but these are definitely a little tighter.Even so, I prefer them to most other underwear and I really like the comfortable waistband. They do shrink a little in the wash, but I find they really hold up in general. I took these underwear (my previous purchase) abroad for 6 months where I had to hand wash them and hang them in the sun... this will destroy clothes pretty quick. But these held up great.Jockey isn't what it used to be... the material feels thiner now.

The cotton is soft and a bit heavier than the cheap underwear you get at Target or similar store. The whites ones are just a teeny smidge smaller than the pastels of the same size.

32,A1LFSTBR7L7PUT,B00008ID0B,V. Wiedemann 2 avid readers,"[14, 15]","I used to wear the Jockey for Her cotton briefs. They fit perfectly and lasted for years. Several years ago we moved quite far from a Jockey store and I had to try other brands, none of which were close to the quality and fit of the old Jockey for Her briefs. I was happy to find Jockey underwear on Amazon but since the picture, the name and the description were obviously different from the original briefs I used to wear I ordered only one package of 3 pairs of the Elance briefs.Boy, am I glad I only ordered one package! I am terribly disappointed that they do not fit comfortably at all. When I got them out of the package the leg holes looked like they were too large and I think that is the problem. They are definitely not full coverage and I do not want part of my bum uncovered. At least the cotton knit is nice and soft.Now I will have to try to find another package of the Lollipop brand cotton briefs I bought a year or so ago. They fit perfectly - just like the Jockey brand used to do. I will say that the Elance pants are not the worst underpants I have. I bought a package of Hanes a while ago and they are much worse!After receiving these underpants I did further research and found that what is described as PLUS size Classic briefs actually are available in the size 6 that I wear.......and that is not a PLUS size by any means. If the description had not specified PLUS size I would have looked at those and ordered them and perhaps been more satisfied. However, I am very hesitant to order any more Jockey underpants because of the problem with the leg openings being too large in the Elance style.",3,Very disappointed,1355011200,"12 9, 2012",0.2365
