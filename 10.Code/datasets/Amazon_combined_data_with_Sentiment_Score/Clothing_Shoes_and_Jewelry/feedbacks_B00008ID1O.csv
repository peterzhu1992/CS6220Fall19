0,ARZLW6MFV58E9,B00008ID1O,Denise Elkin-andrews dee,"[3, 4]",I was waiting to have a bad odor from these panties because other people's reviews spoke about a fragrance. I didn't detect a bad odor and they were exactly what I ordered,5,Excellent,1347235200,"09 10, 2012",-0.0557
1,A454H175JAT32,B00008ID1O,Emily,"[1, 1]","I have worn these for years, but was concerned about recent reviews reporting an odor. They do have a smell, like you might have from your detergent. It is not strong enough to concern me, but I would just as soon it not be there. I have washed them once before wearing and will see what happens as I do more washings. The fit is as usual and I like the colors and pattern.",4,"some odor, but not really a concern",1388880000,"01 5, 2014",0.1212
2,A1X5NM3HXQANFL,B00008ID1O,Jasminenirvana,"[7, 7]",Horrible smell gave me an asthmatic attack when they arrived. Unfortunately I bought 15 jockey underwear so they are going in the trash. Waste of a lot of money! Shame on you Jockey! I have allergies and asthma and only buy unscented products. There should be a warning label on these toxic underwear. Do NOT buy!,1,Terrible Chemical Smell,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",-0.3494
3,AVKF05BAX2Z3I,B00008ID1O,K. H. Noland,"[0, 2]","These are really verging on &#34;granny panties&#34;, and I am by no means a skimpy underwear person. I like a good basic bikini but these are so big. I will keep them, because the quality is good.",3,If these are bikini then I hate to see briefs!,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",0.1821
4,AQJWVL7YBSMOL,B00008ID1O,Mail Debaser,"[3, 3]","Have been wearing these for years, but was hesitant to purchase a new pack after reading reviews from folks who noticed a never ending smell. Thankfully, I was one of the lucky ones. Purchased two packs and had no problems.",5,Fine for Me,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",0.2095
5,A3DF2RIXV8DRJN,B00008ID1O,M. Hofelich,"[2, 2]","The Jockey Elance Bikini is closer to a low-waisted brief than what I think of when I hear the word bikini. The leg openings are low and the back has full coverage. I think they're a nice compromise between a brief and a skimpy bikini.These panties are cool, comfortable, and long-wearing. They hold up well to machine washing. I should note the Elance line runs large on me. You may need to order one size smaller than you would for other brands.",4,Cool and Comfy,1235520000,"02 25, 2009",0.1354
6,A1W64ZEL2TQBPD,B00008ID1O,Naney Naney,"[2, 2]",Fit. Comfortable. Prime. Who could ask for more? It would only be nicer if more patterns were Prime. I had to buy three sets of these to get Prime and now I have a lot of blue in my drawer.,5,Comfortable,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",0.2187

8,A1RF0CB0FH2LD8,B00008ID1O,Sivan,"[0, 0]",These fit better than any panties I've ever worn. The price on Amazon is lower than any department store and the shipping was free. I'm very happy with this product as is my daughter. We've been fans of Jockey panties for many years.,5,Quality,1367798400,"05 6, 2013",0.3817
9,APF6PI31359U5,B00008ID1O,Snow,"[7, 7]","I have been a jockey fan for many years but the last package was poorly constructed, very thin and has started to unravel already. I would switch to hanes all cotton; the waistband is thinner and the fabric is less sheer.",1,Quality has gone Downhill,1369353600,"05 24, 2013",0.0828
10,A26E6RLP91XOEN,B00008ID1O,Susan,"[3, 3]","There aren't many options for inexpensive cotton bikinis that let you pick the color range you want. So I decided to take a chance on these despite some of the complaints about the smell, since some of those reviews were older. These bikinis did arrive with a very strong baby powder smell. I couldn't stand to wear them until they had been washed 6-7 times. However, after repeated washings, the scent is nearly gone. Now they are very practical and comfortable.",4,OK once the scent wears off,1373068800,"07 6, 2013",0.1679
