1,A2TJ89QNOHVFZ2,B00004U1J2,april,"[1, 2]","Very fast shipping!Inflates easily and stayed inflated well.The elastic harness Velcros, so it's safe and it's gives a small 1/4 adjust-ability to their size.They do stick out quite a bit from the sides of the child, but I think it adds to the excitement for the child.a lot of fun, The material is the same as that as a blow-up pool, so there is some durability, but seriously you have to expect that it can easily be punctured just the same if you are not careful.",5,Buzz Lightyear Jet Pack,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",0.9238
2,A1059SSXUZZS1S,B00004U1J2,Cassie,"[1, 1]","This jet pack is easy to inflate, and my son can put it on himself. I like that it's inflatable, so my son can wear it as long as he wants, and then when it's time to take off, I can just deflate it, fold it up, and put it in my purse. The only problem we've encountered is that it rides up pretty high on my son's back, above his shoulders, so he keeps pulling it down lower, but it won't stay. It's pretty durable for an inflatable. My son crashes into things, the dog has stepped on it, but it still works.",4,"To Infinity, And Beyond!",1383696000,"11 6, 2013",0.2411

Ours has already got a hole in it. It's cute, and big, but not very durable.",3,okay buzz light year,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",0.0625
6,A2VNCKMXMHN9E8,B00004U1J2,EAD,"[0, 0]","Ordered this as an accessory to the Buzz Lightyear costume my Son wanted to wear for Halloween. Was easy to inflate and put on. However, there is a pretty heavy chemical smell that comes off the item - not sure if it's from the materials it's made with or from the coloring on the jet pack. Rating would have been 5 stars if not for the smell.",4,Very cool addition to the Buzz costume,1385510400,"11 27, 2013",0.1862
7,A23GX78LIV4J2F,B00004U1J2,Edith W,"[2, 3]","I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume. Unfortunately, when we blew up the jet pack the day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour, it began to deflate quickly. We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material. Luckily, I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in my city which held up fine on Halloween.",1,Diego,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",0.0712

9,A2VHNDYD9B8PGO,B00004U1J2,Kathryn A. Mast,"[1, 2]","These were great for my son's halloween costume. Looks fantastic. They are inflatable - I don't know if you can tell that from the picture. You have to get them really inflated in order for the wings to stick out straight like they should. My chief complaint is how the straps (very thin 1/4&#34; elastic) are attached to the jet pack. It looks like they will break loose any moment. Mine survived a halloween party and halloween itself, but I don't expect this to stand up to much more. It did look great with the costume, though!!!",4,"Good for a night, don't expect this to be a life long investment",1358208000,"01 15, 2013",0.2903

They are inflatable so some care is needed but we have had them for a year and a half now and my son still uses them for &#34;super hero&#34; play time. Great buy, would recommend to anyone buying the deluxe costume for a great and i believe necessary add on.",5,So cute!,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",0.5155
11,APCU5MPM2Y0LY,B00004U1J2,Lady Di Diana,"[0, 0]","My boys are very much into the superhero stage, and these were perfect!! They are inflatable back pieces, with white elastic straps similar to a backpack style. The great thing is no one gets injured from being whacked with the wings of these mid-flight. (as one who got smacked in the face while my Buzz was off to save the galaxy, I can vouch for that). Price was great, these are super fun!",4,Too Cute!,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",0.4208
