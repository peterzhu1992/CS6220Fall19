The cup size fits great but the straps and back clasp don't seem to be sturdy enough to add support or keep from shifting around. This has now become my laundry day bra, unfortunately.",3,Not very sturdy - shifts around a lot,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",0.2815
1,A2L3LZCAU4AFZC,B00008IEUW,Debi Cook,"[0, 1]",I could go on and on about this bra all day long. So so so so so comfortable and makes my boobs look just delicious. This bra has a way of pushing up your boobs and making them look larger without having a bunch of overstuffed padding that makes you feel like you're wearing some sort of costume. I will for sure be replacing the rest of my bras with more of these. I'm actually a little pissed I went so long not having this in my life.,5,Best bra I've ever owned,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",0.1884

Perfect. It gives a little oomph without you feeling like you're going to fall out if you bend over.",5,So comfy!!!!,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",0.224
