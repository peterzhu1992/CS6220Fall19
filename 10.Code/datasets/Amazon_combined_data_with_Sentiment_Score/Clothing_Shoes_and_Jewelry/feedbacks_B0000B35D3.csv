These have a great clasp that won't ever let you down. These will not fall off-they are made well. These look classy, stylish and are a must-have for all. They do look bigger in the picture than they really are though but I didn't want them too big. They are by no means small just not as shown-so please keep that in mind when purchasing them.

They are not as big as you would expect judging by the picture shown. After doing a little research on duragold (because really, what is it?) it appears to have a slightly lower percentage of gold in it and reportedly the strongest gold alloy ever. Whatever that is. Still, I love these except the post is a little long and gets caught on my clothes. I'd buy them again and I would buy them as a gift.",4,Love them,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",0.2451

25,A3KM9UA6MAVURN,B0000B35D3,pjf pjf,"[0, 0]","These 14K gold hoops are about the diameter of a dime 1/2 inch, and the width is about 1/4 inch. The hoops seem sturdy, the catch looks fragile. I did wear them for a week nonstop and they never came undone. But I imagine taking them on and off repeatedly might eventually be an issue with the fragile looking catch. These would be great for a child, and good for a women when she doesn't want a large hoop. These have a post that sticks out a bit in the back, so they are not as comfortable as a hoop where the clasp goes inside the hoop. But it wasn't nearly as uncomfortable as a butterfly back post because the post tends to hang downward rather than poking straight back. They have a polish finish, and are a good choice for a small unobtrusive but substantial looking earring.",4,nice small fat hoops,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",0.186
