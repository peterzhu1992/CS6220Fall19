0,A2EL5GW6B8LWQB,B0000ANDEI,Bill W Bill W,"[2, 3]","I'm a 5'9 dude and about 180 lbs and normally wear a large in jackets and coats. Not this baby. I ordered the large and it sort of dwarfed me. I'm not giving it only 3 stars for that reason however, but rather for the overall rough feeling material that the jacket is made of. The label says &#34;Made in Mexico of US Fabrics&#34; but not sure what fabrics they were actually using, definitely not something that is going to be taken care of in a few washings. If you want a rough and tough jacket where comfort is not an issue, then this might be the right one for you- but if you are looking for a casual outdoors type jacket that isn't stiff or uncomfortable, keep shopping.",3,Be careful when ordering this coat,1380758400,"10 3, 2013",0.2491
1,APO9SQELY2SZ3,B0000ANDEI,handiman handi,"[8, 12]","This jacket is warm in the winter and very rugged and will last many years under heavy use (construction).This jacket is very stiff and can be restrictive. The back of this longer below waist line jacket can ride up after driving and create folds in the back.I had a shorter length Carhart with stretch strip material at the bottom and built in hood. It didnt look as good as this one but it was much more comfortable after being washed several times and lasted years with heavy use.If you buy this jacket, wash it first thing to loosen it up a little bit.I strongly recommend Carhart clothing, but there is compromise with comfort for long wear and warmth.My recommendation is this jacket below:http://www.amazon.com/Carhartt-Mens-Duck-Active-Thermal-Lined/dp/B002WLOK1U/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qlEnable;=1&qid;=1284079028&sr;=1-16",4,Warm in the winter but,1283990400,"09 9, 2010",0.47

We live in Boston, so the jacket is very warm and fits its purpose, the only problem is that is very, very big, i think i got him the medium one and it fits like a large one, it's very bulky too, but as i said, if you are looking for something warm, go for this one but maybe a size less.Nice color and it's cool that it has inside pockets, at least that's what my fiance says :)",3,"It's very warm, but it's to big.",1389052800,"01 7, 2014",0.7529
3,AGB1YDTHIQ59V,B0000ANDEI,JAGMAN,"[1, 1]","Warm and Sturdy. I have only had this coat for a couple of weeks, but it appears to be living up to all the good reviews. Very warm and very well made (in Mexico). I fully expect to use this jacket all the time because it is warm and fashionable enough and should be able to handle anything I can put it through. I am looking forward to breaking this coat in over the next few months but am very confident I made the right choice. For sizing: I am almost 5'8&#34; and the medium came about 2 inches below my waiste aind is plenty big to wear clothing underneath. However, again, the coat is so warm, I am wearing T-shirts in sub 40 degree weather with the coat on - even on windy days.",5,Well Constructed and Warm!,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",0.3792

7,AES28G80KNIRB,B0000ANDEI,The Kidd,"[0, 0]","The Sandstone Traditional Arctic quilt coat is made of high quality-durable fabric. It is water resistant and extremely warm against harsh winter weather. I like how Carhartt sticks to their line of more casual style of clothing and not creating something shiny,fancy and bold. This coat will keep you warm enough, so that you will not have to dress in too many layers. Carhartt makes clothing for the hard-working man. This coat is what we call A Man's Coat.",5,The Arctic Quilt Coat,1353024000,"11 16, 2012",0.1054
8,AXF514L0AH99G,B0000ANDEI,Wyatt,"[2, 2]","I grew up on a farm (and am now 38), and still consider myself a farm kid. But back then, I grew up on a small farm and we didn't have enough money to buy good stuff like Carhartt jackets for us kids who grew out of them every year! I've kind of always wanted one, and finally got sick of Columbia jackets with fleece lining that fills me with static or other jackets that just don't last. So I researched and bought this one.Many of the reviews claim that it's warm enough to wear outside as your sole jacket during winter. This winter (2013) in Fargo has been nasty cold so far, with multiple days with 0 degrees F or lower as a daily high! Most of these cold days, I am wearing a sweater under this, and it does the trick for me going from vehicle to building and back, while keeping me comfortable while driving. I've also worn it for longer periods of time outside when it's cold and windy, with a sweatshirt under it, and it has performed very well. It cuts the wind better than I expected, so as long as you have a warmer layer under it, it really is warm enough.I am 6'3 tall, and about 190 pounds. I also have trouble finding jackets with long enough sleeves. I bought the Medium, Long, and it fits me perfectly!! This is the part I'm happiest about. Even with a sweatshirt under it, it's still big enough.It has lots of pockets. Another important thing for me is enough pockets to carry my wallet, cell phone, and sunglasses. It has 2 large inner chest pockets (one with a velcro top, another with a zipper), and I keep my wallet in the velcro one. It also has 2 outer chest pockets, and I keep my smart phone in one of those, easily accessible, easy to hear if it rings.I am very happy with this jacket, and am looking forward to having it last me multiple Fargo winters!Edited 12/30/13:Just spent an hour and a half tailgating for a football game, at -5 degrees F. I wore a long sleeved dry-fit shirt, a sweatshirt, a jersey, and this jacket, and felt perfectly dressed. I was concerned about spending this much time outside at that temperature with this jacket, but again, with the right layers, it cut the wind nicely, and did the job as expected!",5,"Works for me in Fargo, ND...with layers",1387929600,"12 25, 2013",0.2247
