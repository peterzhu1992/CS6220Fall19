The Developer, Naughty Dog had a great idea, and we at SONY helped them succeed. I love the gameplay, the graphics, the music and the humor. Lots of great animations and funny sounds, such as: &#34;Oombadegha!&#34;. You'll just have to play the game to find out what I'm talking about. I'm proud to have been a part of the success of this series. The REAL tribute goes to the millions of you gamers who bought the game and enjoyed the fruits of our labor of love.

This game's graphics, music, gameplay, and even story were much better than in the first. But it's kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot doesn't end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister, Coco Bandicoot. Well, at least Coco has the ability to speak, unlike her big brother.The voice acting changed dramatically as well, and for the better(Dr. Neo Cortex's new voice was much cooler and evil-sounding).

It's much better than the original.GAMEPLAY: 27 levels, [2 hidden] 25 crystals, 42 gems, and a bunch of secrets! The warp room allows you to choose 5 levels at a time. There are many weird secrets. Like in the first level, once you get the regular gem, return to level one, and don't break ANY boxes. You will get the blue gem. Plus, you can save any time, unlike the original. And you don't have to not die to break all of the boxes.GRAPHICS: Very good for a 1997 game.

6,AA50ZQDY2TPK5,B00000I1BR,game-dude,"[2, 2]","Crash's 1st game (as I reviewed) is my favortie debut game, but his sequel blows me away. There's one reviewer who says this is an improvement on the original with some sassy style. They're %100 correct. The game's best improvements and worst flaws are all I will list, because you already know where I stand if you've read my review on the 1st game (and go check it out if you haven't).Best Improvement: Saving System. This allows you to save at anytime, so you're not going to have to get off (becuase your parents said so, of course) without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over again.2nd Best Improvement: You have 5 levels to choose from at anytime. You don't have to go in order.3rd Best Improvement: More moves. Crash is looking good with all his new stunts.4th Best Improvement: Vehicles. Crash gets to drive some neato vehicles, including my favorite, the jet pack.5th Best Improvement: Greater and better bosses, (including N. Gin).6th Best Improvement: Bigger, Better, and More secret levels.7th Best: New characters. I'm lovin' the new addition of characters, including Coco Bandicoot, Crash's sister (whom I think should've been in the 1st game).8th Best Improvement: It's easier to collect gems, and there's a new addition, crystals.Worst Flaw: Well, it would be nice if Tawna hadn't suddenly disappeared. I think she should've been crucial to the entrtie series, not just the 1st game.2nd Worst Flaw: You can't revisit bosses without a secret code. You should be able to revisit bosses without having to have to look for secret codes to do so.So, those are all the improvements and flaws.

10,ANS7PVYBOXVGO,B00000I1BR,JackLiberty Steven Smith Jr.,"[0, 0]","This is where the Crash Bandicoot games got really, really good. Everything that the first game got wrong; the second game got it right. The second game was released in 1997 as a PlayStation exclusive called Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back; obviously reference to Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. This game is also available on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic to be played on either the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable or PlayStation Vita for only $6 so I&#8217;d recommend getting that version if you are interested. Developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios, the second game was better than the first game in pretty much every way. The second game takes place immediately after the first one as Doctor Neo Cortex survives the battle against Crash in the first game and decides to use crystals to power the Cortex Vortex to take over the Earth. He decides to abduct Crash Bandicoot to gather the crystals making him believe he wants to use the crystals to save the Earth. We also meet Crash&#8217;s sister Coco who is suspicious of Cortex&#8217;s true intentions. Meanwhile, Doctor Nitrus Brio who was Cortex&#8217;s right hand man wants Crash to gather gems so he could destroy Cortex and the Cortex Vortex orbiting Earth so we are presented with many people wanting to side with us, all with different intentions.The gameplay is a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across 30 levels to gather crystals and gems. The game takes place in a series of six &#8220;Warp Rooms&#8221; which as the hub areas of the game. Each Warp Room contains five portals leading to a level. The goal of the level is to obtain crystals and gems throughout the path. Crystals are placed somewhere along the path whereas gems are obtained by either destroying all the crates, or in bonus levels or secret levels; once you obtain the crystal or gem, you have to reach the end of the level, if you exit the level by using the start menu with a crystal, you will lose it. I guess they made it that way to be hard. Once you obtain all five crystals in a Warp Room, you then have to ride the platform in the center of the room to move to the next Warp Room, however you have to fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access. Ripper Roo is back as a boss who is one of the more interesting bosses as he goes from a genius scientist to a mentally unstable psychopath when Crash hurts him, I can&#8217;t help but laugh at this. Then there&#8217;s the fight with Tiny Tiger across floating platform that drop, the goal is to have Tiny be on that platform when it drops and in true cartoon fashion he floats in the air for about a second and then falls, I love that. I was kind of disappointed that the final boss fight was too easy, but whatever.The gameplay is like the first game except with new controls, Crash can now slide across the ground, perform a body slam, crawl on all fours and even slide across the ground and jump immediately to reach higher places. Some enemies can only be defeated by one of these methods so the game has strategy which is nice. The boxes are back which once again have to be broken in order to obtain extra lives and gems. But what&#8217;s nice is you can die and still get the gem without having to restart the level like with the first game. A new famous box is the Nitro Boxes which explode upon any physical contact, but fortunately there is a green colored box with an exclamation mark on it that will explode all the Nitro Boxes in the level once struck. The game also features bonus levels which contain hidden boxes, extra lives and even gems.As a kid, I played the samples_data_script.sh out of this game. It was only recently I managed to beat it 100% because it is both challenging and fun, but it&#8217;s easier than the first game so if you were expecting a greater challenge, you will be disappointed, but the controls, smoother gameplay and the fact you can save anytime you want as long as you are in the Warp Room makes this game a far superior game than the first one.FINAL RATING: 9.5 out of 10",5,It's awesome,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",-0.0307

12,AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B00000I1BR,John. N,"[0, 0]","When it comes to Crash Bandicoot I'll be the first to admit playing the three main games on the PS1 in reverse order was probably a bad idea. The thing is Warped was the only one I had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck, and well, it completely spoiled me. I'm sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but Warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that I honestly wouldn't hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or review.The problem with Cortex Strikes Back is it isn't as polished as you'd expect. I don't mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity (which is superb for when it was released) but a streamline all the cheap-shots out of the experience way. The level of cheapness ingrained in Crash 2's gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places. Things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when that's the exact opposite of what they should be. Worse yet are the game's hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player. The kicker to is just when you think you're done and your guard is down - that's when they throw the kitchen sink at you.The above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it Cortex Strikes Back is a beautiful game. The level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which I feel even give Nintendo 64 games a run for their money. But every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the game's stubbornness start to fade something (again, there is always something) shows up and makes it take center stage once again. Compounding the situation is the fact there really isn't enough variety in the levels. Seriously, if I see another level with the words Crash or Bear in it I am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levels.Annoyances aside, if your a fan of the PlayStation having the three main Naughty Dog-developed Crash titles in your library is a no-brainer. If you haven't played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so you'll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it. Unlike some franchises the first three Crash games get better and bolder with each step. As for the game being discussed here, Crash 2 leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then I can't really say I dislike it either. I do wish it was a little better (polished) than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why Warped is so good. So while I would definitely warn others of game's cheaper side I'd still recommend it to anyone with an interest in platformers.",4,A classic that's classically annoying...,1341100800,"07 1, 2012",0.193

This was the first one of the crash series I tried, and it was fun. Before that, I was hooked on fighting games, like street fighters, and tekken, but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so. In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.It is, more or less, like the first part. There is aku-aku, boxes to crash, gems (more difficult), new bosses after each floor. And by the by, this game is divided into 5 floors, each floor with 5 doors, each door with a different adventure. You can finish the game, like I did the first time, without collecting gems, but it is not that fun. Hint: If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem. There are hidden levels for some gems, you would have to consult the internet for it. Good luck in that.In this part you can save after each level, it is easier in that respect. I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game. The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.The story line is change a little bit. Instead of the &quot;Pamela Anderson&quot; of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky &quot;Meg Ryan&quot; of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.There is also a sixth hidden floor. You would have to reach it by a trick, and again check the net for that.The game was the best I have ever tried. It makes my life harder, since I cannot find better games to play anymore.

However, Crash doesn't know until near the end, due to a terrible signal quality.The gameplay and design has changed a lot with this title. Crash can now use the circle button to duck, slide when moving and crouch jump. There are less levels, but they are divided into five Warp Rooms with five levels each (with a bonus warp room included). Plus you can actually save whenever you please!Along with these, there are also more level settings, whether it would be the woods, the cold, the sewers, even the ruins. Remember when you rode the hog in the first game? Well, this time, you ride a polar bear cub instead.You still collect gems in this game, but the mandatory ones are the crystals mentioned before in each level, which are easy to obtain. You still will receive a box gem for destroying every box (even the new Nitro boxes which should not be touched until you reach the green ! switch), except you can use up as many extra lives as you want and still get the gem as long as each box is destroyed. The color gems still serve the same purpose, even though there are only 5.
