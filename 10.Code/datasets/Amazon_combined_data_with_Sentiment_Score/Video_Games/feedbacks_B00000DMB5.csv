1,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00000DMB5,blackaciddevil,"[4, 5]","Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is the sequel to Turok Dinosaur Hunter that not only surpasses that game in it's greatness but is my most favorite game in the series of four games that came out on the N64. Everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon, especially in the way of graphics. With the expansion pak, graphics had 'almost' a Playstation 2 quality to them. It's something that showed with this game. It showed in the textures of the environments, the details of the architecture, lighting effects and other eye candy. The game was also bigger and better than any other game, with the exception of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in it's 32 meg cartridge. As you've probably read in the courtesy review, it's been stated to have over 45 hours of playtime. While I don't know about that, personally, as I hadn't checked where I stand within the game..one thing I do know is it's one lengthy meaty game to sink your teeth(playtime) into.While Turok 2: Seeds of Evil stood in the shadow of Rare's Goldeneye during it's release, Turok 2 still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every Nintendo fan should add to their collection. If not for the fact that it had a killer storyline and an awesome arsenal of weapons to play with, then for the fact it was an absolute beauty of a game.",5,Turok 2: Seeds of Evil.......,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",0.2344

The graphical content and gore was stunning to my 5 year old eyes. The first level took me forever to beat and I only beat it once. Plus I didn't have a controller pak. Then came the day I bought it again for my n64, nothing looks more sexy than Turok 2 in a green nintendo 64. The first time I ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only 6 levels. Weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing. I was always able to hold as many as they would let me. Such as doom, Turok, South park, Armorines, perfect dark, etc. Then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about Fps. Sure they have better graphics and frame rate. But they are all the same to be honest. Emulators sucks ass I don't care if its rgb or not. But just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fps's are all I got. But something about the way a n64 looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much. To me it's the best looking system and has the best looking games. Turok tops it all! Way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n64 was capable of. Turok 2 is on pc and n64. The n64 game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate. Stencil bit shadows were a new thing in 98 so iguana tried it out. In my honest opinion I wouldn't have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all. Still it is stunning the n64 could handle what was thrown at it. The AI in the game was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen in a game and still is. They are smart and fight one another (really fun to watch) I found the game to run best in Hi-res-LB and looks the best as well. The weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different. My favorite weapons are the Tek Bow, Shotgun, War-blade, Razor-wind, Cerebral bore, Plasma Rifle, Mag-60, Grenade launcher, the kick ass Charge Rifle (ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING WEAPONS), Firestorm Cannon (like a mini-gun but different and bad ass sounding), Nuke, Flamethrower (The first fire to actually show 3D even in almost all games on n64), and the torpedo Launcher (because you can go through water faster). Music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and Turok 2 has the best music in any n64 game I have ever heard, sorry Perfect Dark your music and K7-Avenger are great to but Turok is to bad ass. Iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that, that the music is in all Turok games as well as Vexx and Armorines and more have some similar sound. The multiplayer in Turok 2 to me is absolutely stunning (I run that in low-res) and is just as good as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, The world is not enough, and Turok Rage wars. Quite a few games ran on the Turok engine as well. Armorines (a amazing game! Uniquely different yet just as awesome), and South Park (not many liked this game but to me it's like a mixture of Doom+Turok=South park!... The multiplayer is good to just don't go above 2 players.) So you see Turok 2 was used in many things and is an amazing game. Once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed. They were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so. Making their games unique. Most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did. Extreme G2 for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player Grand Prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything. Extreme g2 to me is the best out of the series. I have almost every game by Acclaim and love every game (except turok 3, its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap). So Turok 2 is amazing! if you want to try it get it now! on n64 or even on PC! You will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels! Turok is the greatest fps try them all! (your own risk for 3 but a good to the collection) Dinosaur Hunter 1 amazing smooth game great n64 game, the first fps on n64. Seeds Of Evil 2 Worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play. Shadow Of Oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection. Rage Wars the true sequel or attachment to Turok 2 and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns. Evolution fantastic remake of the first Turok starring Tal'set and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over 14 chapters and has awesome multiplayer. Turok PC,360,ps3 I played it on 360, Runs on the Unreal Engine (which is bad ass) a great game with good weapons (Why I liked it is because I was quick and accurate, I run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like Turok 2 but not as good and not as good music, awesome multiplayer [if anyone is on] and a good campaign). These are the Turok games! Which started out as comics and became life and were playable. Get Turok 2 you will enjoy it! And bring a few friends over! It is A True Turok Game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy CoD fans.",5,Turok 2 My childhood game!!!! Relives and Tops ALL!,1342224000,"07 14, 2012",0.318
6,A28JDCKBEDSI1D,B00000DMB5,Matthew Faulkerson Guitarist and PC Geek,"[0, 5]","This game's graphics and animations are very well done, and the story line is above average. The thing that in my opinion makes it average is how long the levels are (coupled with the ridiculous Death Throes, more on the later). It reminds me of the days of Jaws and Friday The 13th games for the NES where the levels dragged on and on and on....each level in this game will take you at LEAST three hours to get thru and not only that but youll have to back track thru old levels to get new keys and items etc. After a while it gets to the point where you get tired of it and quit. And one more thing this game seems to have been made for a bored teenage kid or adolescent, there are no puzzles or challenges to keep you intrigued, except for the occasional switch to find and that gets boring. The game is basically just kill this dinosaur and watch the blood spew forth, while it goes thru a ridiculous Death Throe.Considering how long the levels are use the cheats some have mentioned and you should get a lot more enjoyment out of it (at least that way you wont have to be backtracking all the time).

8,A1PW7R95QGQ1CD,B00000DMB5,Nathan Metric DaveDogg,"[1, 1]","This is a great game if you are prepared to accept that this game really wasn't meant for the N64. The game has numerous slowdowns even if you have an expansion pak on the N64. Not everywhere, but anytime there are a bunch of explosions or a whole horde of enemies are following you then you will have some sorta slowdown. Now onto all the pros of this game.I witnessed this game before I played it. My friends were playing it when I was like 11 or so and this game scared me to death. I thought Reptoids and Endtrails were the scariest monsters ever. Capturing children not knowing what they were going to to do to them. This game saids its rated M, but you really should play this when you are a kid. It's a whole lot scarier when you're a kid. Not so much when you're an adult. Either way this game gives off a very unsettling atmosphere. If you want a mindless shooter like the original Turok this game is not for you. The antagonists actually have a story this time.The enemy AI is very realistic. The monsters react with the precise speed and vitriol that makes sense.The graphics were probably the best graphics on the N64. Again, the N64 version has slowdowns, but at the time these were the best graphics we've ever seen in a video game and I still quite beautiful in retrospect.This game also have a variety of very orginally designed monsters. The raptors and Purrlin are still here, but they are way cooler and better equiped this time. You fight genetical engineered dinosoids, zombies, Purrlin (big apelike creatures), insects, spiders, cave dwellers (The Blind Ones), worms, a fat bitch that comes near the end, and even robots. All look bad ass looking and ready to kill you.The death animations are some of the best death animations ever made in the history of video games. In this game you litteral can blow someones head off, or a limb, or a whole torso.The weapon choice is also top notch. I'm sorry, but the Cereberal Bore was the coolest weapon ever thought of. That's just my opinion. There's just nothing better than locking onto an enemies head, shooting a bore, the bore drains the cereberal fluid, and then explodes when it reaches the center. Coolest weapon ever made. The Razorwind is also cheap as hell.I really can go on and on about how good this game is. This is probably my favorite FPS next toDoom both which are tied for first.",5,The Last Great Turok game (besides Rage Wars),1300665600,"03 21, 2011",0.0004
9,A3713PP4MADKED,B00000DMB5,Nick Watkins Nick Watkins,"[1, 1]","After playing Turok: The Dinosaur Hunter for ten minutes, I realized I had a great game at hand. It was like Mortal Kombat, except in a shooting-game. Blood everywhere, amazing enemies and weapons, and a good, good time. And I'll admit this; I don't actully play the Turok games. No, I'm sorry, I don't. It's not that their hard, or boring, but I don't play them...well, not without the cheats at least. As soon as I find out a new Turok game's coming, I get on the internet, go to Happypuppy.com, and find the Master Cheat. Yeah, it's pretty low, but it's fun to go in these blood-soaked shooter games. And the second one is no exception. I played this game without cheats for a few hours, made up my mind, and decided it was great, and would be even better with cheats.Half an hour later, I came back with the Master cheat in my hand, which is BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND, or, if you break it down, BEWARE OBLIVION IS AT HAND. Within minutes, I had an amazing arsenal, all maps, invincibility, and more by my side. The weapons...well, let's just say the first Turok can't touch them. You have the usual knife and bow and arrow, pistol, shotgun, and the rest, but you now also have a nuke, pod layer (which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact), a machine gun (as the first had, but this one's much better), the Cerebrial Bore (the most gory weapon of all. It launches out a little ball, and it goes straight for the enemies head. When it gets there, it starts sucking and draining blood form their head, then, after 5 second, it explodes, and takes the enemies head with it), my personal favorite, the Razor Wind (a shield with sharp edges on it. You throw it and it cuts up all enemies in it's path, then come right back to you. It can chop off just about any limb you throw it at; the head, the legs, and the arms), and another physical weapon, the War Blade. The name says it all.Overall, this game is a vast improvement, and is the best yet (but that might change as soon as I play Evolution). The graphics are great, awesome story, vast, detailed enviroments, and some hot blue chick that always pops up.

11,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00000DMB5,R.A. McKenzie,"[11, 11]","Turok 2: Seeds of Evil has a lot to love about it. The music rocks. The graphics are still quite good for N64 standards (especially if you have the Expansion Pak). It controls just fine (get used to the C-button controls). There's some good multiplayer. It's a bloody, gory mess. And the weapons are freaking awesome (just wait till you see the Cerebral Bore).But there's a big problem with it: DESIGNI'm not talking about the art direction or graphical look. Turok 2 is still a good-looking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects. But these levels are confusing as all hell, with the exception of the 1st one. If we had a better story to go along with it, then maybe there'd be a reason to plow through. But for whatever reason, Acclaim & Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels, and if you're stuck, you're stuck for good.You will be required to light beacons, find keys, and rescue children. Again, Level 1 isn't so bad, but Levels 2-6 are gonna be a pain in the butt if you get lost. The map you're given sucks. And to make matters worse, you can't leave or quit levels once you've selected them.But if you're not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online, then Turok 2 will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in 2000. The combat is still a blast (although the final Primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes). The presentation is sharp. And the Turok world is still very unique from today's overload of military/war shooters.Turok 2 was one of the N64's most critically-acclaimed titles for the console, rightfully so.
