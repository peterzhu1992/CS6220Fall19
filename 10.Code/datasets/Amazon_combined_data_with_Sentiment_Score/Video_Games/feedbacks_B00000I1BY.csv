0,AH5OGQP0S9KSU,B00000I1BY,Alan C. Logan,"[0, 0]","This is one of the greatest games of all times. No if, ands, or buts. This is the granddaddy of them all when it comes to survival horror. Yes, Alone in the Dark, Uninvited and Sweet Home came first, but they went nowhere. This is what kick started an entire genre.I love this version of the game the best (even more than that ReMake) because it has 3 options for gameplay, original, beginner or arranged. Arranged is awesome as it arranges the locations of many items in the game. Much like the 2nd quest on the first Zelda game.The voice acting is legendary, the graphics just awesome and who can forget the live video at the beginning and ending of the game! (The girl who played Jill is absolutely beautiful.)This game is hard. One bites puts you in orange caution if you're Jill, on arranged anyway. Ammunition is VERY limited at the start of the game. But that's what makes it so great. You can't run around blasting things. It's just wonderful!There are many easter eggs or little things to find out in this game. (Look up a good walkthrough if you have trouble finding them.) These give the game a good bit of replay value.I highly recommend this if you want a good game.

1,A2ZF78RQCO57FU,B00000I1BY,Alec Malczynski,"[1, 1]","RE is a game that not only the first game that took more than an hour-and-a-half to beat, it was a revolution in video game playing. It was the first in it's time. The first game to have actual 3-D characters, rather than the suposive 3-D design that Doom and Duke Nukem bragged about their choppy, cardboard design. Now that the movie of Resident Evil is out, kids and teenagers will be rushing out to buy the RE games. For an aparent reason, the original RE isn't being sold anymore, rather that it's very, very rare and probably costs around 70 to 80 dollars. Instead, they're is the Director's Cut. The DC is a odd version of RE that most people will be mistaking by the name. No, it isn't more gorier, and no, Deleted Scenes not included; seriously. Originally, the DC version had a much more explicit graphic beginning, with blood and all. But due to censorship and problems with young kids bying M-Rated games and watching R-Rated movies, the scenes were cut out. The only real different thing about the Director's Cut is the different costumes availible and items are in different spots. This will leave already RE owners high and dry, while satisfying non-RE game owners. Anyways, the story.In RE, a group of Special tactics commandos, known as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) are dispacthed to a secluted mansion in the middle of a remote forrest. The mansion once harvested top secret government experiments, lead by a Evil Corporation known as Umbrella. After the first squad, Bravo Team, was shot down from their helicopter and diseapeared without communication. The second squad, Alpha Team, was sent to rescue them. But a few scuffles with unknown creatures, leads their helicopter leaving them in the middle of the forrest. In panic, the team finds refuge in the mansion. But little does the team know is that their troubles just begun. You have the choice to either play Chris Redfield, a ex-marine turned SWAT commander, or Jill Valentine, a strong guided commando with the ability to pick lock doors and locks. Through out the game, you must survive in the mansion. Your enemies are Bio-infested Zombies....that's right, zombies. The problem; you're running low on ammo. The story goes together, much like the basis for Sam Raimi's Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn or George Romeo's Night of the living Dead. Complete with FMV cut-scenes, that include, no less, Screen Actor Guild rejected actors with terrible acting and bad dialouge (You almost turned into a Jill-sandwich!!!), but never the less still a fun game.

Although the Survival Horror genre is certainly old, being Interplay's &quot;Alone in the Dark&quot; the first example to come to my mind, RE sent the genre and the video game industry where it had never before ventured.The idea, simple as it sounds, harbors with it the strength to create a fine video game experience: Lock yourself at a mansion filled with zombies and other creatures plus limited ammo, and try to get yourself out of this.This is the only game of the series that is worth of any praise, not only because it did much for the industry, but because of its game play value.",5,The RE Series proud.,977875200,"12 27, 2000",0.1976
5,A3D9V8QB1APIH5,B00000I1BY,Bankz Cesar Z,"[2, 3]","...Resident Evil : Directors Cut is a enigma in itself. Now why do I say that? Well basically this is not a Directors Cut because capcom messed up. The only people who officially got a Director's cut is Japan and thier initial release of Biohazard (Resident Evil in Japan). What we are missing is actually about 14 seconds in 2 different videos you see thru the game. In the opening video, 10 seconds is missing which actually makes the video more graphic when Joseph dies by one of the zombies dog's and some of the characters are smoking. In the second video where you meet your first zombie, you see a more graphic depiction of the zombie eating Kenneth. But is it really worth it? Most Gamers don't even know about it much less care, but collectors and true fanatics are really steamed about it.The STORY is very well done I can say. Even though it does not really keep pace within the game, it is very interesting and revives a cult classic monster....zombies! Vicious murders have plauged the town of Racoon City and it is up to the S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics and Rescue Squad) to find out where the source of these murders are coming from. You take on the role as Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and attempt to investigate a house infested with things that go bump in the night. Get ready to immerse yourself in the game that started the genre - Survival Horror.The GAMEPLAY is what to can be expected from a game like this. You will be jumping and many scenes in this game for it will spook the life out of you. I know you are saying...this is just a game....its more than that, trust me. You basically navigate your character throughout the game solving various puzzles to gain access to different areas. You will find plenty of ammo and weapons to help you battle the many monsters you will come up against. Other S.T.A.R.S member will be around to help you out....others will try to block your way. Although the controls are very hard to get used to, eventually you can compensate in many situations. You will battle zombies, dogs, crows and the dreaded M-121A's....the Hunters. But don't think you won't have the weapons to defend yourself for you will be armed with 9mm, shotgun's, a Colt Pyton and a fantastic Missle Launcher.The GRAPHICS are what to be expected for this game. I personally saw no problem with the graphics. Many people complain about the camera angles, but to me the camera angles added more spook to the game. The Hunters still looked scary as heck with the limited graphics. Many of the cutscenes are shown within the game engine, but the opening and ending actually have real actors. Yes the dialouge is cheezy, but what do you expect?Overall I really enjoyed this game even though it took me a long time to get around to playing it. I still cannot get over how much Wesker in the opening movie looks like Val Kilmer from Top Gun. It had me jumping in a lot of areas and the puzzles were not too difficult. A great game and a great buy.",5,Still the spookiest of the series.....,995932800,"07 24, 2001",0.0802
6,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00000I1BY,Ben Rowland,"[2, 3]","This Director's Cut is the only version of this game you should own, simply because it supports the Analogue joysticks on the Playstation controller. The control in the other versions is impossible at times, and a bugger to learn if you are a first time player.The game by itself is excellent. Lot's of puzzles, and lots of Zombies to shoot down. There are times (many of them, actually) where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot, because you can run low on bullets very quickly. The story is standard for any Survival Horror game: A group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies. An evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies, and the fallout turns the WHOLE TOWN into zombies. To survive, you must make your way through the mansion, and solve all the puzzles. This is definitely a challenge, and one that can be frustrating at times, but rewarding once completed.Here are the pros. The graphics are superb. The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread, and yes, the blood flow is well detailed, it sprays when you are wounded. The music is ominous and ambient, giving just the right mood to the situations you come across. The story is also well put together, even though anyone who has seen George Romero's Living Dead trilogy (and what horror fan hasn't?) can get a sense of deja vu. All these elements make this a game well worth getting.Now for the cons. This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation, but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck. Sometimes, a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to back-track just to see if you missed anything. This adds much more time to the game, but not in a good way. There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you. Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off, but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve. Also, the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical, and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies.Overall, this is a great game with a few shortcomings. But then again, nothing is perfect. If the Survival Horror concept sounds appealing, then you should check this one out. The Resident Evil series has become the benchmark of Survival Horror much like Final Fantasy has for the RPG genre.",4,"A bit tricky at times, but well worth the bloodshed.",1014163200,"02 20, 2002",-0.1781

However the horrid control, horrid graphics were bearable, but the lousy voice acting was not. I couldn't stand it because here was a great classic B-Movie story (and I love B-movies) with F-Movie acting. Everything about this game became cheesy. I then bought the director's cut hoping for better voice acting... well at least I got my wish a couple weeks ago. I then bought the dual shock edition.... yeah, I'm kind of bitter, but I won't hold a grudge because Capcom and Nintendo provided me with what I wanted recently. But this game could have been better, even for the time it was released; at least the voice acting could have been better.

11,A3CYIPLD9090ZK,B00000I1BY,David Baker,"[1, 1]","Nowadays, blowing zombies up is as commonplace as a 2D fighter that houses a character that can throw a fireball. From the &quot;House Of The Dead&quot; series to &quot;Silent Hill&quot;, everyone has ripped off Capcom's masterpiece. The story starts off in a city us hardcore gamers will all know, Raccoon City. On a hill in an out-of-the-way area lies a mansion that holds a deadly secret. Down in Raccoon City, the community has had violent attacks by zombies that are bumpig off the townspeople. The R.P.D. send out their S.T.A.R.S. unit to find out what's up with this mansion and it's 'monsters'. Both the Alpha and Omega teams shall never be the same....... What you encounter through this tale of death is nothing short of terror perfetion. From your first encounter with dogs, to your first boss, to your return to the mansion only to find your zombie pals have been replaced with gremlins from hell called hunters; this is horror-gaming nirvana. Your characters are Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. You get to pick which character you lead (or lead you) down your path of hell. Jill is the easier one to use, while Chris is the harder one. For example, Jill starts off with a pistol, while Chris starts off with the forever dreaded knife. Basically their stories are the same with some different twists thrown in here and there. For example, Jill's sidekick is Barry, while Chris gets Rebecca. Throughout your journey, you pick up on clues as to what's going on. Such as diary entries. You come across the mansion twice, a backhouse, a garden, an underground passage way, and an underground laboratory throughout your story. All the while you hear the name of a corporation (one that will haunt you throughout the series) known as Umbrella. The game isn't hard, but it isn't easy either. Worrying about ammo and herbs is always the number one priority. Playing through the game to see what's ahead (you know, horse around), then go out for real and work your way through the story is the biggest tip I can give. And always save (just don't over do the ink ribbons, there's only so many). The graphics were breathtaking then and still hold up today. The control is difficult for some to get used to, but I never had a problem with it. The sound is also amazing, but quite important. Usually when I play games, I put on my headphones (Nine Inch Nails for me) and play away. Unfortunately, I can't do this. You need the sound to hear what's going on, whether it's zombies that are lurking around a corner you can't see, or something following you, you have to listen. This adds to the gaming element immensely. It'll often scare you, but that's the point, adding a new gaming dimension. One of fear. My only problem with the game, is the story of who originally owned the mansion. ... Ultimately, Capcom scratched all that. And it detracts from it all as the story behind the mansion has too many holes. In the end though, this was a classic video game. Not the best Resident Evil, but mandatory if you intend to play them all as the story is missing a lot if you pick up on the series when it's already told so much. It's graphic, it's bloody, it's epic, it's scary and it's an experience you won't soon forget.

13,A1TJIJKKN15KR9,B00000I1BY,drqshadow,"[0, 0]","Capcom's legendary Resident Evil series and I have never really seen eye to eye. Though I own nearly every non-GameCube title in the undead thriller's history, I'd never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it, right up until this past week. I'd always found the series to be misleading, disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times. Time after time, I'd sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games, and time after time I'd get bored, stuck or distracted, leaving the game behind. I grabbed Resident Evil 3 when it was relatively new, and the title has sat, unplayed, on my shelf for years. That was, as I said, until this past week, when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series, even if it drove me to madness.I'll make it really blunt; the story is absolutely terrible. The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world, occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through. Nagging issues, such as why somebody would lock their home's single shotgun away in a room that's only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles, aren't even touched upon. What if somebody breaks in, in the middle of the night? Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed, run downstairs, jog to one side of the house, move around a couple statues, grab a key, run to another corner of the house, open a door, grab a fake shotgun, return to the original side of the house, unlock the doors and replace the real shotgun with the fake? I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things, but they'll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play.The graphics of the first Resident Evil really haven't aged well. Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically, each one looking almost identical to the others. Polygon models are simple and blocky. Textures are pixelated and undetailed, looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendo's SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title. The series' characteristic pre-rendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places, forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room. Merging still images with live polygons, Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics Myst and Alone in the Dark.The bread and butter of any console title, its gameplay, is the one area where you'll really learn to love or hate this series. Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments, Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens, occasionally containing interactive elements of their own. You'll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles, never in control of the camera itself. They'll enter a screen on the left side, mosey around a little bit, kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side, immediately entering the next screen from another direction. Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release, this scheme brought with it numerous problems, the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen. It's not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen, only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next. It's a really cheap way to take a hit, and can mean a speedy, frustrating death in later stages.Looking back, the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary. Rather than applying a more traditional platformer's control layout, Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotation-based configuration. Left and right don't serve to strafe, they stop the character's movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place. Up moves you forward, and down moves backwards. Pressing R1 draws your weapon, and pressing X at the same time fires. It's a scheme that's more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship that's defined the action portions of this series since day one.Many of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion aren't so much brain teasers as they are time wasters. You'll realize what needs to be done within moments, but chances are good you won't have the piece needed to do so on your person. It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris, cautiously walking around, learning the position of the zombies, figuring out the puzzles, groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest, fifteen minutes away, and repeating that process. The second time through, playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where, I finished in three hours and twenty minutes. That's one heck of a variation.The soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something that's difficult to categorize. Imagine, if you can, a blend of symphonic suspense, the song that plays when you push demo on a keyboard, and elevator music. That's Resident Evil's melody. The composer tried to capitalize on the few jump out of your seat moments the storyline provided, but surrounded by cheesy samples, monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the N64 than the PSX, there was only so much that could be done.On the large, this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time, something fresh. It wasn't a blockbuster, oh-my-god-get-me-the-sequel-now, mind numbing experience. I can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel, but even today I couldn't have predicted the amount of games it would spawn.",4,"A Solid, Unsuspecting Launchpad for Survival Horror",1054684800,"06 4, 2003",-0.2445

This review will really help for someone who has played RE2 but is wondering what RE DC is about. Well, you've came to the right place. First of all, here are the facts:1. Each zombie takes 5 shots NO MATTER WHAT. (with the Beretta)2. Jill is a blonde all though she doesn't look like it (a very dumb blonde)3. BARRY HAS A MAGNUM AND HES PROUD!!!4. You have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down. (that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the room...the just pop up!)5. This game has hilarious dialogue!Well, speaking of dialogue, the grammar is also very bad...and I mean VERY bad. Examples are: (when you pick up the 1st floor map) &quot;You got the 1st floor map&quot; RE2 says &quot;you've taken the 1st floor map&quot; that makes more sense. &quot;You got the acid rounds&quot;...funny sometimes. Also, what I found is that Jill doesn't know what blood is. Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor. Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask &quot;What is it?&quot; and she stays there and studies it...??? Barry replies with &quot;I THINK it is blood. I hope this is not Chris's blood!&quot; And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times. But when there is a big monster coming they just talk &quot;wow. its a monster. what do we do?&quot; and when there is like a door that doesnt open (during movie scenes) they say &quot;THIS DOOR WONT OPEN!! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO??&quot; Also, a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself, and Barry replies &quot;No that's okay...I have THIS!!!&quot; And holds up his Magnum...I laughed my head off...he sounded so stupid! No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny!Another fact is that the camera angles are bad, but the puzzles are harder. Hmmm? Resident Evil is a very very very good game...but it is just the dialogue and camera angles...ive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting, despite it's happy mediums.So theres a few final things I have to say here:1. Barry has a magnum 2. Wesker has shades 3.

If I made the game, I would have just said: &quot;Y'know, that was really bad, let's just not have a cinematic.&quot; Also, the movement is quite shabby and fake looking, and while a zombie hovers into a standing position, you can't shoot him until he is standing up and walking toward you.If you think that such a picky thing about positioning, picking up items is worse. You can commonly at a position in which you appear to be facing an item perfectly, but you can't pick it up, because it's really 30 degrees to your left or something like that. With these positions, you are forced to listen to mind-numbing music. I thought the sound effects were bad and the voice acting made the sound bad enough, but they had to go and give us the abolute worst soundtrack you will ever find, for any game or B-Movie. The only trouble with the music is that you require listening to the sound effects to survive, and so you must endure the music as well!However, the music is beaten in abysmal-ness by its dialogue. The script is terrible, and to say the voice acting is laughably bad would be a huge understatement. It doesn't end there. The pitiful dialogue scenes do nothing but tell one of the most cliche-ridden plots ever devised. You have police traitors, huge creatures that come out of rooms that you just came out of to kill you, and worst of all, you have about three dozen times through the two stories (which are almost identical) where people walk in just in the nick of time to save the other. That type of stuff makes me sick. You are alone for about two hours, when suddenly a trap goes off, right as your partner happens to be right outside.Lets rate everything: Images: 8, Movement: 5, Script: 1.5, Sound Effects: 6, Background Story: 5, Music: 0.5, Voice Acting: 0, Puzzles: 10+, Mosters: 5/6, Weapons: 8, Fear: 9.5, Plot/Sequence of Events: -2.",3,A Great Game With More Flaws Than Any Other Out There,979862400,"01 19, 2001",-0.1966

One of the main points of the story is the isolation and being alone searching for your fellow teammembers. If there's 12 of them in all and the main idea of the game is isolation and terror you better believe you'll find some dead teammembers along the way. The story is pretty much known around the world. STARS Alpha team has been sent to investigate STARS Bravo team's dissapearence in the woods near a mansion that belongs to Umbrella. The T-Virus (Tyrant) has been let loose and killed the employees turning them into zombies, and unleashing other creatures (Hunters AH!). The game itself really isn't that long, once you learn the puzzle solutions you could breeze through it in a few hours (for which you may be rewarded). The Arrange mode on this Director's Cut version features different uniforms for Jill and Chris and some different camera angles and puzzle solutions. Items will be switched around to different locations as well. The overall scare factor of this game is pretty nil, but you might jump at a few spots. The graphics are dated, sure, but they're basic and likeable. You can tell what's going on and still see extra details (unlike the remake where the entire game is a pile of details upon the next pile). One of the most famous aspects of this game is the voice acting and FMV sequences with actual actors (if you even want to call them that). The in game voice acting, when you actually find a fellow STARS member alive, is pretty terrible. I'd like to track these people down and see if they haven't been murdered because of it. The FMV sequences are pretty classic also, the opening is the same for eather game and the endings are different depending on who you save during your adventure as Chris or Jill. FINAL NOTE: I highly recommend this game (the Director's Cut version since it has 4 games total) even if it is extremely old to anyone! The explicit scenes of blah blah) at the beginning of the load don't really make a difference as it's all squares anyway, but this game is actually REALLY fun to play through.

23,A3E6LFV7XEGACM,B00000I1BY,K. Tucker,"[0, 0]","The original Resident Evil is the purest example of a survival horror video game. The newer RE iterations, while fun in their own right, are not survival, and some would say not even horror video games.Resident Evil throws the player into an old, dilapidated mansion with the vaguest notion of zombies on the prowl. The original party is split up to investigate the area, and the player is left to find clues towards a path to safety.Unlike many games supposedly within the Survival Horror genre, Resident Evil hits the nail on the head with the notions of staying safe. Enemies are best avoided, as direct combat can result in being quickly overcome with zombies or being poisoned.Items are hidden throughout the mansion that detail just how the monstrous zombie outbreak started, and to a lesser extent details the lives of the individuals who lived there during the initial stages of the outbreak. There are pictures of their families and friends, their clothes tucked into their closets, and, on occasion, the zombified individual himself, trapped and desolate in a bathtub or a wing of his home.Playing the game, one truly gets a sense of being stranded. In essence, it puts the player in the perspective of every human being there during the outbreak. You never know who or what has been turned, nor where those beings now dwell. Caution is the only priority, and this game capitalizes on that.Weapons are not found sitting out for any person to find. The player must actively search for items to aid in his or her quest. Guns are definitely there, but they would be about as well-hidden as a person living inside the mansion would have them. The control scheme may seem archaic now, but for the genre, the controls are spot on. Maneuvering through a hallway full of zombies should not be an easy task, and given the options presented, it really isn't.Puzzles are a central (albeit quizzical) part of Resident Evil's gameplay. In keeping with the survival elements, some doors are locked; to pass through them, the player must find the key. This involves searching room-to-room around the mansion, and solving the occasional puzzle. These elements are definitely well-aligned with the gameplay, but from a strictly survival perspective, some puzzles fit the scheme better than others.The plot is weaved strongly through the course of the game. Many of your allies are found dead throughout the mission, consumed by the horrors of the mansion. Others are as desperate as ever to get out, while some are a bit too satisfied hanging around. The plot is advanced mostly through cut-scenes where characters interact with each other. The voices, as all know, are pretty hilarious (or bad, depending on your perspective). For the time, characters using voice-overs as opposed to text was revolutionary. Unfortunately, the voice acting didn't stand the test of time, and some of the more hilarious quips are almost inside-jokes among video game fans.The graphics were definitely of the era. In 1996, this game's graphics would astound any who saw it. Twelve years later, they are clearly dated. Many games of this era can't stand the test of time (strangely, games of the 16-bit era age more much gracefully, and even modern games have become throwbacks to the visuals of that time period), but Resident Evil fares better than many Playstation titles. Many of the pre-rendered backgrounds are highly detailed and set the mood wonderfully. Given the polygon count of the day, its pretty easy to tell where your character stands against the backdrop, and conversely, where the enemy stands. Thankfully, the color schemes applied to enemy and ally serve to blend objects and backgrounds together seamlessly.The sound is more forgettable than anything in this game. The soundtrack does serve its duty well in creating and maintaining a frightening atmosphere, but there's just not anything noteworthy enough to stick out after over a decade. The sound effects, while not fantastic, serve their purposes extremely well. Given the player's mood, one would still be prone to jump when a noise is heard off-screen.With a game as old as this one is, it would be easy to find faults -- especially comparing those faults with current-gen gameplay mechanics and graphics. However, if one can allow themselves to enter the early PSX era, the true beauty of a game like Resident Evil can shine through. While not perfect, this game serves as the ultimate example of what survival horror is. RE set the stage for things to come, and its great to be able to go back and see the humble beginnings of some of the greatest plot elements and gameplay mechanics we enjoy in video games today.",5,A timeless classic,1226707200,"11 15, 2008",0.0739

Like Silent Hill I played and beat the game within a week of it's initial launch. I didn't have alot of gripes about the game being as I was blown away by the very idea of a survival horror game. Let alone playing such a game for the first time in my long gaming history.The music and graphics for this game are by no means good to todays standards. Back in the day as with Silent Hill they were top notch or very near it. As far as puzzles go, Resident Evil had both passable and challenging puzzles... nothing that took away from your gameplay or experience which was a nice touch.As far as gameplay this Resident Evil game, Director's Cut, was my favorite up until Resident Evil 2 and more recent Resident Evil 4. As I said with Silent Hill neither game is better than the other but I would strongly recommend skipping this game for this system and get the Resident Evil Remake for Gamecube.The remake enhanced not just the graphics but the over all story and appeal of Resident Evil, the original classic survival horror game. In closing I have to say that I graded this a 3 as I did with Silent Hill, they are two different kinds of scares and two different worlds but the graphics and dated sound leave me empty.

25,AKFE1P1ZDBPXU,B00000I1BY,M. B. Link wildfirelink,"[20, 24]","Resident Evil: Director's Cut (1997). The PSX re-release of the 1996 survival horror game.Back when the PSX was first released, the system didn't have much in the way of standout games. Of course, there were a few noteworthy PSX launch games like Twisted Metal, Doom, and Tekken, but for the most part, the PSX didn't have anything outstanding yet. Thus, Resident Evil was made. Taking influences from the earlier survival horror series Alone In The Dark, Resident evil took all of its aspects to the next level and eventually became one of Capcom's most successful franchises to date, ranking just behind the Mega Man and Street Fighter games. In fact, the original RE game was probably the first PSX game to make the system worthwhile before other important games were released in the following years.Most everyone who's played the games already knows the story, but for those who haven't, here's a brief synopsis: A strange murder occurrence just outside of Raccoon City has caused Police officials to be suspicious, so they sent two Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (STARS) teams to go investigate. You play as either Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield, both of them surviving STARS members. The teams end up getting stuck in the mountains, so they eventually find themselves inside a huge mansion, where the STARS members discover numerous creatures such as zombies, mutilated dogs, giant spiders, and other monsters. These were all created due to Umbrella Corporation's disastrous T-Virus. As the game goes along, more important discoveries are made.Now let's talk about the game itself.Of the three PSX RE games, this one easily has the worst graphics. We're talking first-generation PSX graphics here, if that's any indication. The character models are all blocky and easily stick out from the otherwise highly detailed still-screen environments. These environments are navigatably 3D, but the camera angles sit at fixed 2D points, which can be both good and bad, depending on the situation. By bad, I mean that some angles hinder the view of the action. The monsters (especially the zombies) have very limited animation and models compared to the later games, and its limited engine prevents the game from having more than 3 monsters on the screen at one time (not including the crows). So the only real decent graphical aspects are the rendered environments. But even they don't quite compare to the detail in the following games.The sound effects are good for the most part. However, the zombies come off sounding more like moaning old men than actual monsters, and the voice acting... dear god? don't get me started. It's so hilariously bad that it's just fun to listen to. The dialogue doesn't help things at all along with the horrible acting which is bad even by B-movie standards. One of my friends almost died of laughter the last time I went through the game. The music on the other hand, is decent and suits the mood of each area appropriately. It's nothing special, but it does add to the overall suspense.The controls are something that most people either love or hate. It took me some time to get used to them, but now I have no troubles whatsoever. Most people that hate them don't seem to realize that RE isn't just an all-out action game, but rather an exploration puzzle type game with action segments. The controls were a bit rough here, though they have been more refined in later releases. I do admit though, that it does get very tedious backtracking to the item box again and again because you can't hold all the items you want to. Between the two playable characters Jill and Chris, I personally found Jill to be the better one to control because she has more inventory slots and weapons than Chris, although Chris's voice acting isn't quite as nerve-grating as hers is. Both characters each have their own sub-character that helps them along game, such as Barry who helps Jill, and Rebecca who aids Chris.Most people have said that this game was the scariest of all the RE games. I'm not sure I agree with that, but the atmosphere can be quite chilling at certain points. I suppose that the dogs breaking through the glass windows could've scared newbees to the series, but since I was introduced through RE2 and the fact that I've already played the MUCH freakier Silent Hill games, the original didn't scare me nearly as much as it should have. To the game's credit though, it does present the most puzzles, and a majority of them are real brain-benders. It's something that the series started to get away from as time went on. Plus, I thought that the game itself felt larger than all the others in the series, so it will take a while for new players to beat it. The challenge is also very high since there is very limited ammo to take out the creatures with. Even veteran RE fanatics still find the first game to be thoroughly challenging enough to come back for more.This version of the game is a director?s cut edition, but it?s really nothing special. All we get is an extra mode that is more challenging and features different outfits for the main characters, but if you already own the original, there?s no need to get this version. Apparently the Japanese version also had extra cut-scenes, so we were cheated! So much for it being a ?director?s cut?, huh?Although this game is extremely dated by today's standards, it's still worth checking out if you're a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place. However, it's not really necessary now that a MUCH better remake is available on the Gamecube, so I suggest looking into that game instead. RECOMMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO FANS OF THE SERIES.

The best answer I've come up with is that Sony Playstation had some smash hits that the Saturn did not have. Games like Tomb Raider, Twisted Metal, and Final Fantasy VII were mega-hits that Saturn did not have an answer for. One game came very early into the Playstation library and was deemed an instant classic by gamers and critics alike, and that game is the first Resident Evil game, the first true hit for the Sony Playstation.Released by Capcom in early 1996, Resident Evil was unlike any game we had ever seen at the time. With an opening title screen that explodes in blood and symbolizes terror, Resident Evil is a game that truly doesn't reveal itself right away. You have the opening story cinema scenes that vaguely explain your elite police officers' reason for venturing out into strange territory in search of your teammates. One of your teammates is killed during the investigation of the crashed helicopter by a strange canine beast of sorts, so the actors run for shelter in a spooky looking mansion.I won't rehash everything about the game, but I believe it is important to try and recapture the feeling of the first time playing the game. It's pretty difficult to describe. The music is perfectly eery and sets the tone grandly with stringed arrangements you would hear in a suspenseful terror film. You walk around trying to find clues about what is going on in this strange mansion. Bizarre zombie creatures roam around desperately seeking to sink their teeth into your fresh blood, you try and find better guns to deal with these creatures, and you also try and find the keys to unlock the doors without knowing what terror lurks on the other side. On top of that, the seemingly haunted mansion has traps and strange puzzles that must be solved in order to continue finding your way closer to the end of the game, almost like a spooky mansion in a murder mystery. Horribly mutated dogs crash through windows when you least expect it, and the ammunition in the game is in a very limited supply, so you are forced to make snap decisions whether to stand and fight or run for safety. Scattered throughout the game are personal correspondence, diaries, and logs that reading will give you a clue to the ultimate mystery surrounding what the hell is going on.Before this game, the story regarding Umbrella didn't exist. Ironically, this kind of makes the game more mysterious. In other games, we already know about the Umbrella corporation's role in the story, so this game is a unique experience of unraveling the truth. On top of that, this game takes place in the Spencer Estate Mansion, which is the perfect terrifying setting for this unique gaming experience. There's nothing wrong with the second and third games taking place in a Precinct, but a haunted mansion crawling with the undead is just perfect.Chris and Jill are the playable characters, both with their strengths and weaknesses. Honestly, Jill's game is much easier. She gets the bazooka, which Chris does not, and is given the lockpick at the start of the game in place of having to find the Sword Key. Jill also has 8 inventory slots to Chris' paltry six, and because Chris has no lockpick, he has to find small keys to open the locked drawers for ammunition. Having a small key clogging one of Chris' six inventory slots is quite a nuissance, especially since Jill does not even have to bother wasting one of her eight inventory slots with the lockpick. Finally, the obvious reason for Jill's easier game is in her companion, Barry Burton. Barry is very helpful and will heal Jill from a giant poisonous snake, give her acid rounds for the bazooka, help her to get the shotgun and will even torch the massive Plant 42 for her, while Chris is forced to rely on the inexperienced Rebecca to learn to play piano, find serum for him, and mix up a potion to injure Plant 42. There are ways to alter Rebecca's actions to make her a bit more useful, but in the end her assistance is not as valuable as Barry's.Today, the polygon graphics that were so compelling during this age of gaming do look substantially dated, and the voice acting, which was considered atrocious even when the game was new, is laughably absurd. But who couldn't use a laugh after the horrors and suspense of playing this game?We all know the storyline of the game, and most of us remember all the thrilling moments to the point where they have lost their sharpness over the years. But take yourself back in time for a minute and try to remember what this game felt like to you the very first time you played it when you were much younger, and games were much different. This game felt like nothing we had ever played, and no gaming experience was even close to what we got from the playing the original Resident Evil. Back then, there was still alot of social debate whenever a game came around that featured a significant amount of violence, yet Resident Evil was so unique in that it literally felt like being trapped in a scary zombie movie. There wasn't much debate surrounding the gratuitous amount of gore like there was with other games (Mortal Kombat), and instead gamers and critics were unified in their praise of the game's excellent and unique gameplay and experience.Gamecube would later revamp the game with updated graphics, better voice acting, and many new thrilling surprises, but you just can't beat that feeling you got when you first popped in this game not knowing what to expect. This game has one of the greatest legacies, and is every bit deserving of all the accolades accumulated since.",5,The Game That Revolutionized Games,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",-0.05

I love this game, in all of its dated graphics and game play with additional cheesy (Jill Sandwich) dialoge glory. That is what this baby is, glory. A truly excellent game, with excellent graphics, for its time and it's, for this nerd at least one of the fondest memories of my wasted childhood I have. In fact this is one of the things I spend countless hours mastering that I don't regret one bit.The control is simple and responsive, which I like. This game to me was my first introduction to actual video games, sure I'd play Mario or Primal Rage or what ever on the old SNES. Then one fatefull day young Kazuki Ferret was (at age 8) introduced to Resident Evil. The game for him, challenging puzzles which tested intellect, well designed levels and characters, and o' course guns.Looking back now, this game was an excellent first for the giant we know today as the Resident Evil series. With such classic games as RE2, RE3, Code: Veronica, and RE4 stemming from it. This game is a simple must own in your video game collection, if you see a copy and don't own one; buy it is what I say. I got the copy I have for $5.00, which is an excellent price for such a classic game. There is no reason not to own this game.-Kazuki Ferret, 'The Angry Resident Evil Nerd'",5,"The Angry Resident Evil Nerd, is pleased!?",1198886400,"12 29, 2007",0.2816

Half of the S.T.A.R.S., a police group who's always hired when things go really bad, goes in to investigate, but they don't come back. That's when the rest of the group come to Arklay Mountains to see what's happening to those missing people and to the missing part of the team... They would just wish they were never born.Resident Evil is a classic video game series. Unfortunately, the first movie wasn't nearly as good as any of the main games from the series. The graphics might not be great since most of us own next-gen consoles like PS2, Xbox and GCN, but they're still decent.The soundtrack is amazing, voice acting is a little weird and a little silly, but it's OK. Videogames aren't about how close to reality it looks and feels. If it was, games from the past would be forgotten very quickly. What makes horror games special is how fun and scary they are, and this, along with Silent Hill, is the best horror game you'll ever play.",5,And so this is where it begins...,1365292800,"04 7, 2013",-0.0486
