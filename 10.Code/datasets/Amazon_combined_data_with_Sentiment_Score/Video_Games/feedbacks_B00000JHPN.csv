1,A4C38HZYNECXJ,B00000JHPN,dib dib,"[1, 2]","This is one of the Great Games to have ever come out. It is not enough to even call it a true classic. It's not only an absolute top quality puzzle-style game, but it has a great story, unique and original characters and settings, and beautiful graphics. And just the originality of that beautiful new world, mythology, and fantastic concepts make this game a cut above the rest!Why is it Great? It's a real puzzle game. Not that there's always one solution, or a right or wrong way to do things, but it is a game that focuses on technique, creative thinking, finesse, and (sometimes) quick reflexes. There is no life bar; the game doesn't focus on that, or combat, it focuses on simply being able to figure out a solution and being able to execute it. And it's fun, not boring and repetitive, but also very challenging. And you have unlimited lives, which makes for playing with friends a lot of fun as you can pass around the controller to see who has the best ideas and skills. It is as much fun to watch as it is to play.One of the original concepts behind the game was that the main character was supposed to be non-violent, but that isn't entirely the case as there is violence of a sort. The main character just isn't directly violent. But this is one of the highlights of the game, not a detraction (as I, and most gamers, would normally consider it to be). You can't just plow your way through levels: you have to think, watch, time your actions, and adapt to the challenges. But, when you do get those few opportunities to just gun your way through a level, it only makes it that much more fun.And the game is tight. The controls are very well done. You can easily master the fast maneuvers to co-ordinate with the necessary actions and specific spacing needed. You'll get frustrated in some hard areas, but you will be able to play fast and risky (just kind of show off) or you can play slow and cautious. It's all up to you and if you want to take your time and get through it with as few attempts as possible or if you want to just try to fly through an area and risk killing yourself a lot. Sometimes luck favors the brave.And the game environment is solid. A very well done and/or tested. I don't recall ever finding anything that was glitchy.If you like quality puzzle-focused games that have straight-forward challenges (the game doesn't scale or do anything cheap to mess with you - try to make the game more challenging), and enjoy a good storyline (with great humor that doesn't take away from the game), you really should check out Abe in Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee (and Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus). It is a really great game that is nothing but quality. This is definitely one of those rare games worth owning and replaying.",5,One AWESOME puzzle game in a Great New (Odd)World!,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",0.3408
2,A1LW0G97AIJ0PV,B00000JHPN,Donna Smith,"[1, 2]","Oh boy, what's not to love about this game? It's an instant classic.In Oddworld, you play a slave called Abe, who works at the meat-processing plant Rupture Farms. Abe's a Mudokon, hardly your typical cute platform hero, but a gangly, orange-eyed, green-skinned creature with a samurai's tuft of hair and the posture of an ape. The story's premise is that the factory's owners have found a tasty new treat to whip into production since they ran their last dish into extinction. The problem is, it's you. Or more precisely, the Mudokons. When an eavesdropping Abe finds this out, he starts ham-stepping stage left, right quick, proving that curiosity can save the cat, too. Your goal, as Abe, is to escape Rupture Farms, liberating as many fellow Mudokons as possible, and find a way to bring down the entire plant. But playing a Christ figure isn't as easy as we'd all like to think. Using a limited vocabulary set, Abe must convince the Mudokons to follow him to safety, all the while racing through the factory flipping switches, avoiding obstacles, evading heavily armed guards, and staying alive.Give me more, we need more games like this one.",5,This game's the bomb!,1291420800,"12 4, 2010",0.1341
