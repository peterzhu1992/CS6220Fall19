I'm proud of what we did, and I STILL enjoy the Crash Bandicoot gameplay and graphics. Buy them up folks. I had to buy these because my little girl gave my copies to her little friends back in the '90s. I hadn't given it much thought until now, and realized that I just had to have my own copies again.

3,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000I1BQ,B. E Jackson,"[4, 23]","Wasn't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games? That's what Sony thought would happen back in the day. After all, they promoted the game to death. Well look at that... didn't happen! And with good reason. The game is horrible. I can't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or, especially, the Mario Bros. series.You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic, but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way. When you think about it, the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released, therefore Sony didn't even NEED a mascot. People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway! Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.You'd think for a debut game (a BIG debut, considering all the advertisements on TV commercials) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play. Instead, Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels (impossible to complete AND find- I didn't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet!)Even if you ignore the bonus levels, the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages (such as the one where you're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level!) All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away. A mascot debut game shouldn't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game. Children will not like the nonstop frustration.I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isn't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic, but featured in a 3D world. Think about it. Crash collects berries throughout the game (Mario collects coins, Sonic collects rings). Crash has a spin attack (Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash's existence). Sony just didn't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different, and that's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot. When you already have the best (Mario and Sonic) you don't need imitations.Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on (not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation, however) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang. I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting, frustrating experience. Heck, just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten. Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore. This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely, and not really miss out on anything.",1,dull,1153872000,"07 26, 2006",-0.0733

9,AA50ZQDY2TPK5,B00000I1BQ,game-dude,"[3, 3]","Crash Bandicoot's my favorite video game character and all his work is genius. I'm looking forward to his latest video game installment, Crash Tag Team Racing. The game's graphics are good, the gameplay itself sounds amuzing, and the trailer (on GameSpot) prove how visually stunning it's going to be too. But, Crash's humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonic's were. It was much better, more creative, and bigger.Mario's was just an arcade game. It was hard, but it didn't take to long to master it, and I don't even know if there was a boss. Sonic's debut was better then Mario's. A game you could play without spending money, good levels, challenging, better bosses, and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary. But, these debuts lacked what Crash's had. Most challenging, best bosses, better secret ending, and most of all, a 3-D world to play in.Crash's world is not fully 3-D in this game (in fact up till Crash Twinsanity, none of them have been), but it is very good as far as it goes. The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world. That's one of the game's strongest points. The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands. This spoiled me. I'd play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response. I became versatile after a while though. Crash lacks moves in this game, but he has more then Sonic and/or Mario had in their debut games. Crash has 3, Mario and Soinc only had 1. Crash's moves are running, jumping, and spinning. The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing. To make up for Sonic's spin, Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns. Crash's spin is much easier to control and is much more effective. It also doesn't threaten you in a strange, almost indescribable way. Sonic's spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning. Sega called this the spin dash. This could throw you to your death. Not Crash's. Crash could move or stay still when spinning. Note: Soinc didn't have the spin dash in his debut game. Mario and Sonic's jumping, I'll admit, was better. They were tighter then Crash. Their direction could be changed much, much easier then Crash when jumping. Crash jumps higher though. Crash runs kind of slow, especially when you need to get something done. But he's slower in Crash Twinsanity. Crash's camera control is hardly ever a problem. Every once in a while you'll have to strain your eye a little, but it's still a better camera then Soinc's. Mario's is best out of all, though, 'cause you could see the entire level all at once.As for the other features of the game, they're pretty outstanding. The levels are big and challenging. There's also secret levels in Crash. I've never seen anything like that in Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, have you? No, I didn't think so. Crash's biggest flaw is the saving system. In the game, you must collect 3 tokens of Crash's girfriend's head (hidden in the level) to get to a bonus area. You must get to the end of the Tawna (Crash's girlfriend's name is Tawna) Bonus Round, touch Tawna (who's just standing there), and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save. If you don't do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save, you don't get to save. Not fair at all. But, it's still better then Sonic 1 or Donkey Kong, 'cause you can't save at all in those games. There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game, The Cortex (main bad guy of the game) Bonus Rounds and the Brio (Cortex's right-hand man) Bonus Rounds. You can't save in these bonus rounds, even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms. Oh and get this, there aren't Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels, so you don't have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and you're in a level like Hog Wild where there's no bonus rounds. Big flaw. The 2nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems. In the game you must collect 32 (I think; don't quote me on that number, because I'm not sure) gems in order to see the secret ending. However, it's a little too hard to collect them all. I understand most people think the game's not hard enough, but I think it's a little too hard. To collect a gem, you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life. I'm all for destroying every crate, but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem. It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes.So, if you're wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash, I'd say Crash all the way. And, as you can see, if you're reading this, Crash's 1st game was much better then Mario and Sonic's. I say Crash is best, no matter what anyone else tells me.",4,My Favorite,1121299200,"07 14, 2005",0.0687

14,ANS7PVYBOXVGO,B00000I1BQ,JackLiberty Steven Smith Jr.,"[1, 1]","Let&#8217;s go back in time to one of my favorite PlayStation icons: Crash Bandicoot. For those who don&#8217;t know, Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans. Crash would appear in many games, but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation: Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. With that said, let&#8217;s take a look at the first one in the series.The first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in 1996 with Naughty Dog developing the game, Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors. It was a PlayStation exclusive, but would eventually get re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation 3. The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages, Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas. The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio. Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains. What&#8217;s weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in, I don&#8217;t know why though, it&#8217;s definitely unusual. But nonetheless, let&#8217;s continue with the game.The first thing that stands out are the graphics, the graphics for 1996 looked fantastic, they were even better than Super Mario 64 on Nintendo 64 which was released a month later. It definitely gets an A+ for presentation. The game was a huge hit and was the first non-Japanese game to achieve commercial success in the country. Now, let&#8217;s discuss the actual gameplay.The game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend. The game is split into levels with one basic goal: get to the end without dying. You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit. Yeah, it&#8217;s weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived. Why is it that these characters who are very athletic can&#8217;t figure out how to swim? I hate games that do this because when you see water, you&#8217;re never sure if the game will allow you to swim. It&#8217;s stupid and what&#8217;s weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear. So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself.You can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting 100 apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros, but the apples are everywhere in this game so it&#8217;s really easy to get a one up, you could literally get at least three lives per level. Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies off-screen, I like that, even if it&#8217;s a rip-off of Super Mario World. You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey, if you find it, it gives you an extra hit point, but you don&#8217;t actually wear the mask it just follows you. If you get three masks without losing one, you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starman&#8217;s in Super Mario Bros.The boxes are also a rip-off of Super Mario Bros. in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes. But not all boxes are the same, there are boxes without question marks, arrow boxes that propel you in the air, boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere, checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them, whatever you do, don&#8217;t spin attack them because they will immediately explode.A strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups. What&#8217;s weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesn&#8217;t let you rescue her for some odd reason, but what&#8217;s even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password. I don&#8217;t understand why early PlayStation games didn&#8217;t allow you to save anytime you want. Every video game that can support a memory card should do that, I hate writing down passwords so I can continue. But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so it&#8217;s at least not a long and annoying password.If you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes, you&#8217;ll get rewarded with a gem, this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates. Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach, much like the vine in Super Mario Bros.Now while this game has some flaws, it&#8217;s still a good game overall, it&#8217;s not as good as the second and third game, but it&#8217;s definitely fun and enjoyable. The creativity is good, has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic. If you have a PlayStation Network account, give this game a chance, it&#8217;s only $6 on the PlayStation Store so it&#8217;s not expensive or anything. It&#8217;s definitely a classic.FINAL RATING: 8 out of 10",4,"It's good, not great, but good.",1395014400,"03 17, 2014",0.0876

16,A3BC8YL69NOCUP,B00000I1BQ,jmpg,"[3, 9]","Naughty Dog and Sony released Crash Bandicoot, which rivaled the likes of Mario and Sonic. In the end, many gamers liked Crash's non-stop action, but others simply just skipped it. Even though it was very promising, Crash's gameplay did not really offer anything new, which featured elements you can find in a 16-bit platformer.You play as Crash, whose girlfriend is kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex. You basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world. Even though the action is intense throughout, the gameplay becomes really tedious. Crash Bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it isn't really 3D since you're restricted to one path. All you do is make your way through levels, dodging obstacles, avoiding enemies, and collect items and nothing more. The difficulty level is not exactly high either, and the challenge is severely lacking.Crash's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game, including well-textured environments and colorful characters. Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy. The visuals are the game's only saving grace. Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it doesn't use analog. You're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.Aside from good graphics, you're left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a 16-bit Sonic game in a polygonal world. While it may be 3D, Crash plays out too much like an old side-scrolling game of the past. I don't know why would anyone want to play this game because Crash Bandicoot pales in comparison to other breakthrough adventure games at the time, like Sega's NiGHTS and Nintendo's Mario 64.",2,Make like a bandit for this Bandicoot,970963200,"10 8, 2000",0.0359

It was, in fact, so delightful that I looked around for the first part to start from the proper point.When I started playing the first part, I was disappointed by the difference of the story, but, still, It was a nice game.The graphics are excellent. The story is original. It speaks about a genetically engineered dog, named Crash, that resembles human beings. This genetic procedure was done by Dr Cortex (or more precisely by his degraded assistant). Then Dr Cortex goes on the produce a new female version of this Crash. Of course crash falls in love with her. Dr Cortex, being a wicked soul, parts between the two and then Crash needs to go through so many obstacles to reach his lover.So many levels are divided into islands, and each set of levels is followed by a bad boss. Some are hard and some are easy. It depends in your skill in such games. The story is concluded by a battle between this Crash and Dr Cortex. If you win then you got it.And to complicate life even more, the designers introduced the concept of gaining gems. If you get all the gems you can continue the game in a new fashion. I aint saying it 'cause I don't want to spoil things for you. To attain these gems is a difficult task. As for me, I got them but after being kicked in the teeth for it. You should not even dream of getting the gems in order of levels. No, mon ami, some times you have to go to a certain advanced level to get a green gem, for instance, to get the gem in the, say, fourth level. You would have to check the net for the tricks, dirty if I may, and the hidden places. Good luck in that.There is aku-aku, which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies. Take 3 aku-akus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touch.Of course, there are saving stations. You do not get to save after every level. This is a drawback. Saving stations are also level you have to jump, crush, step on dynamite, and so on. If you fall down, you cannot save, you have to go to the next saving station. It is hare, I am telling you.The game is great, and if you win with a 100 per-cent then you are the man!Crash 2 (5 Stars):The Best Game Ever:This game has everything the first part lacked. It has even better graphics. This was the first one of the crash series I tried, and it was fun. Before that, I was hooked on fighting games, like street fighters, and tekken, but they are not that fun after playing it a 100 times or so. In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest.It is, more or less, like the first part. There is aku-aku, boxes to crash, gems (more difficult), new bosses after each floor. And by the by, this game is divided into 5 floors, each floor with 5 doors, each door with a different adventure. You can finish the game, like I did the first time, without collecting gems, but it is not that fun. Hint: If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem. There are hidden levels for some gems, you would have to consult the internet for it. Good luck in that.In this part you can save after each level, it is easier in that respect. I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game. The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs.The story line is change a little bit. Instead of the Pamela Anderson of a lover Crash had, he gets a more geeky Meg Ryan of a sister. Dr Cortex is still missing things up. The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex. You want to know more? Get the gems first.There is also a sixth hidden floor. You would have to reach it by a trick, and again check the net for that.The game was the best I have ever tried. It makes my life harder, since I cannot find better games to play anymore.

But, in my opinion they are just fine. The save system is the worst I have ever seen, but it just makes the game that much harder. The way it works is, for most levels, there is a bonus level. Once you finish that level, which dissapointingly is very short, you can save the game. But, not all the levels have this bonus level, which makes it really hard. You have to get through a few levels in some cases to get to a bonus level. And the thing is, each time you load the game, it starts out with four lives, no matter how many you had when you saved. So that makes it really hard. What you have tio do is play the levels in the beginning to rack up lives. But get this: once you play the level once and collect all the lives, you cannot collect many more. If you play it again, you will not be able to get as many lives as before. The boxes normally filled with lives are now just filled with fruit. Collect 100 and get another life. But that takes a while. And also, you can only play the bonus level once. If you save the game and try to play it again, you can't. So, you really have to work hard. Pacman World is so much easier than this. With this, you really will get frustrated. It is not as fun as Pacman World, or Crash Bandicoot 2. That is a better game than this one. But, for a first try, the company did a good job. The music is one of the best things in this game. Crash's powers and moves are limited though, but the graphics are good for 1996. It is 2011, I know, but it is not too late to buy this game if you have a playstation 1 or 2.

24,A2TP4A79ZRVTHV,B00000I1BQ,Orphan of Sickness,"[0, 0]","I remember when I first got this game with a Playstation console in early 1998. It was a great phenomenon then, because the Crash Bandicoot series was able to bring some new life to the platforming genre of gaming with its 2D and 3D interchangeable levels.Crash must go through 25 levels and 6 bosses in this game, but unlike the later games in the series, Crash must tackle the levels chronologically by progressively going through 3 islands.While the gameplay is fun and interesting, the game has its flaws as well. First off, you can only save when you either complete a bonus round (which can only be access one time in each level) or when you collect a gem for destroying every crate in the level. This gets frustrating, because in order to get each gem, you must complete the level and break the boxes without losing a life, plus the fact that colored gems are required to complete certain levels. If I were you, I wouldn't worry about the box gems just yet and just try to find the bonus in the newer level you are at if you want to call it a day. You may have to do the newer level again, which tends to be a flaw.Despite this, I highly recommend this for fans of previous platforming games like Donkey Kong Country and Sonic the Hedgehog. While the series would improve, this is not a bad start.",4,Solid Platformer With Some Flaws,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",0.498
25,A2S1TF4OD00K53,B00000I1BQ,P. G. Keller Packerfan75,"[3, 3]","I'm semi serious about this. This game is tough. It's an excellent platformer, one of the all time best for that matter, but some of the levels are rage inducing.Crash is the perfect mascot/icon for Sony and they let him go. At the time when Sony needed one, Crash was there and sold systems. He was the face of Playstation and it's baffling why they didn't hang on to him. Just ask Nintendo or Sega what the advantages of a mascot are. Nintendo is dead without Mario and after many failed attempts, Sega is still trying to resurrect Sonic. Crash was perfect for Sony. He's funny, has attitude, likable and recognizable and the games we're the first, really good 3D platformers for the next generation. He also provided a stable franchise for the younger audience, which every company knows they want and need. What happened here? Man, I remember the commercials when a guy in a Crash outfit went to Nintendo headquarters and stood outside with a bullhorn and was taunting Mario, daring him to come out. Classic. That was Crash. Sony really dropped the ball here.Crash has never been the same since Naughty Dog let him get away. Other developers have made some very uninspired sequels with him, changing his looks, alliances and even voice. I know you can't do the same thing forever but none have come close to the success of Naughty Dog, when they held the reins of this franchise. Today, Crash sits in a woeful state, being made to participate in very un-Crash-like games.This game started it all though. This changed the platformer forever. While Mario and Sonic we're still going left to right in their side scrolling adventures, Crash took us into his world with glorious 3D. It said something about the future of games and consoles at the same time and it was only on Playstation. Even today, this is a very challenging platformer. Amidst the Ratchet's, Jak's, Sly's and 3D Mario's and Sonic's, the original Crash is about as tough as there is. But it's also compelling enough to want to keep going. You never don't know how your going to get through the level (they're linear afterall), it's getting the right timing and touch to do what needs to be done. There are some truly insane levels here that will test all your patience and nerve. But you'll just want to keep trying, at least till you get to your next save point so you know you don't have to do the level again that you just did. Fortunately, there's plenty of fruit and extra lives, but your gonna need them all.The audio, video, and play mechanics in the original Crash trilogy are spot on. These games still look, sound and play great today. They're a very few of the only original PSone games I can bare to look at, let alone play anymore. The look is perfect with bright colors and varied enviornments and the music and sounds are catchy and perfect for each stage. These games have aged extremely well and are a real tribute to the developers at Naughty Dog.There are a couple of downsides though. These games are really tough, maybe too tough for the average gamer or especially child. Some of this is intentional design and some I feel maybe the fact that 3D platforming was in it's infancy at this time. Some of the angles on jumps, just seem a little off. The perspective can make it really tricky. Another problem is that the save points can be a little far between. Not the check points during the levels, they are plentiful and life saving, but the save points. Sometimes, I just wanted to finish a level I'd been on for a while, save and quit. But then I'd find that I had to go through another whole level and a half, just to get the bonus round/save point. And even the bonus round was tricky sometimes as it's set up as a mini level requiring you to get from one side to the other but if you fell along the way, you'd have to restart the level to get back to it. Again, more challenge and patience testing. My final complaint is that sometimes you'd have a nice number of lives you've accumulated from previous levels, say 20 or so, you save, come back and you only start with 4!!! I want my lives, I earned them!!! On a final note, I downloaded Crash on my PS3 but cant save as it wont, even though PS2 games do, so I have to use passwords. It's a little annoying but if they didn't provide them, then I'd really never be able to save.For anyone new to Crash, looking to try it out, don't let any of this put you off. These (the first 3) are fantastic games overall. They're among the tip top in the platforming genre and are some of the most challenging but rewarding at the same time. Crash is truly a gaming icon and I hope some way, somehow, that his original developers can one day give him and us another grand adventure worthy of the name Crash Bandicoot.",5,"Crash Bandicoot, a Game or a Torture Device?",1209254400,"04 27, 2008",0.1783

There are about 30 levels in the whole game to go through, in which range from extremely easy to almost impossible. The game is probably the hardest of all the Crash games, so anybody who wants a challenge is in for a treat. The graphics range. In some, the graphics will have you staring, and in some, you just plain will not be impressed, but I'm not saying anything about that. This game has a high amount of replay value as well, and for some levels you will need strategy. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the horrible save system. You can only save if you get to Tawna bonus rounds, (common) and complete them, (not too difficult), or collect a Gem, (medium difficulty to almost impossible.)

Nasty difficulty spikes (the eight or so level should be closer to the end) and the 'one path to the end of a platformer' standard which Super Mario World truely broke when it came out take the one star out of this otherwise superb game.While the graphics are fantastic for PS1, and moderate at worst for PS2, sometimes I find it hard to tell where, exactly, Crash is going to land. Also this very much 3D platformer has 'side scrolling' sections where I become convinced that pressing down will make crash duck, not fall into a bottomless pit, water, or whatever else is in the foreground. Saving can sometimes prove difficult, although, if you look in the right places, you can find a way to save after every significant area. Also, often after completing certain difficult areas, you'll be able to do them again at any point you desire, good for getting the games bonuses.I haven't finished the game yet (I'm only half way through), so anything in this review could change, although it's unlikely. Most Naughty Dog games are consistantly good or bad in every way.Anyway, the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening EVERY box in the level without losing a single life.

30,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00000I1BQ,S. Rhodes,"[0, 0]","Back when the Sony Playstation and Nintendo 64 were first released, people were getting all excited over Super Mario 64 in 1996. It was new, it was innovative. It had something. Meanwhile, the Sony Playstation got Crash Bandicoot, and this was described as a game that could take Mario on at his own game. That, of course, didn't happen, as Mario still holds the torch. However, Crash Bandicoot wasn't a bad game. It was, however, a bit more flawed than most other games out there for certain reasons, the main one seeming to be its unforgiving difficulty. There were, of course, other mitigating factors.Crash Bandicoot carries the--even then--overdone save the damsel in distress storyline, ala Mario saving Princess Peach over and over. Much like Mario, however, Crash wasn't about storyline. It was about gameplay, and here it's just as simplistic as it is in your average 2D side-scroller. Crash only has two attacks. His spinning attack and a jump attack. You'll use this to take down your enemies. There are advantages to using one attack over the other. For example, the spinning attack can potentially send enemies flying into other enemies while the jump attack gives Crash some extra air, which is actually needed to access some of the games little secrets.Throughout each level, Crash also has the ability to obtain Aki-Aki. A mask that serves to protect Crash. If you have one you can sustain two hits before you die. If you have two you can sustain three hits. If you have three you'll be temporarily invincible. The game also makes it a point to give you an Aki-Aki if you're dying too many times in a certain level, and believe me, that'll happen a lot. The good news is that Crash Bandicoot isn't shy about giving you extra lives. The bad news is that you'll still mow through a lot of them pretty quickly. A lot of the times things are just unfair. The camera is permanently fixed behind Crash, so sometimes it's hard to predict jumps, or sometimes even where some enemies are. Also, the amount of surprises they throw at you can be annoying as well. Like a bridge where the planks fall out and then you get to what is seemingly a dead end only to find out that you've no time to look because the plank your standing on is also lose. Thus, you've no choice but to go through a lot of trial and error in levels.To its credit, though, Crash Bandicoot has a variety of levels. There's the basic 3D platforming where you basically run through the level in a straight line with the camera behind you, but there are some levels that make you go about the old fashioned way by these levels being 2D side-scrollers. There are also levels where you'll run from a boulder in Indiana Jones style, levels where you'll ride on a hog. You'll get your fill from these levels. Although, many level designs are also very simplistic and straightforward. There's not a whole lot of exploration to be done, and even when you can veer off course, you'll only be backtracking to get back on the right course. In short, many levels are just too linear.Mastering the game is also fairly difficult. Throughout each level there are crates that you have to smash. If you smash all the crates, you score a perfect. Seems simple right? Well, the catch is you have to smash every crate in the level without dying. And again, with some unfair camera angles in some levels, and the trial and error, you'll be attempting to score a perfect on a level several times. Likewise, it seems strange that the levels are so difficult yet the games bosses are so easily taken down--including the final boss Dr. Neo Cortex. Most boss battles aren't a challenge, but getting to them sure as hell is.Even the games save system is flawed. As you go through each and every level you'll find tokens that'll let you catch a glimpse of the girl Crash is out to save in this game. The problem is this token is hidden in crates throughout the level. The second problem is that you need three of them. The THIRD problem is that you have to go through some stupid mini-level in order for your game to actually be saved. They're played out in a 2D side-scroller like fashion with the exception that even in these levels there are some 3D elements, which again require trial and error to get through sometimes. At least you don't lose a life... just the chance to save your game. The FOURTH problem with this is that once you collect all three tokens, whether you were able to make it through the bonus round and save your game or not, you can't get them again. Thus in each level you're only given the chance to save once, and you may not even get it! This is inexcusable. The later installments of the series certainly did a better job with the save feature. There's also a password system here for those who don't have a memory card, and that's really nice to have. Again, however, it sucks that you only really get one chance to save. You can save after scoring a perfect on a level, but again, that's a one time deal. You can't go to an easy level, score a perfect and save again.Despite its gameplay issues, Crash Bandicoot looked good at least. Especially for a game released in 1996. It runs fairly smoothly, and just looks great for the time of its release. It wasn't a launch title, but at least it was a game that was easy on the eyes. The levels also look good and even too this day the game still has a particular visual charm to it. It can't hold a candle up to today's graphics but in 1996 this was a charmer. The game also didn't sound so bad either. Some tunes do get annoying, but a lot of tunes really satisfy the levels, and the sound effects are brilliant. As far as presentation goes, Crash Bandicoot really knew how to hand it to us.Unfortunately, it's unforgiving difficulty may actually be enough to turn some fans away after a while. Was it a good game? Sure it was. But the first installment just had a lot of unforgiving issues that thankfully were worked out in the second game. It's not bad for a first outing, but a game shouldn't be so unforgiving in its difficulty.Pros:+It's a good looking game+It sounds good+Simple gameplay that anyone can pick up and learn+A variety of levels+Tons of secrets and little things to do; you'll be busy just trying to complete the game 100%Cons:-The difficulty level of this game is unforgiving-Bad camera angles-The games levels are difficult yet the games bosses are disturbingly easy-A lot of trial and error moments-Many levels are too linear-The save system set up is absolutely horribleIt's still a good game, but later games in the series do a far better job.",3,Crash's First Outing is Flawed,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",0.0424
