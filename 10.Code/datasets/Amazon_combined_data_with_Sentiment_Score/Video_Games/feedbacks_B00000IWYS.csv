Also, how many of us wish that you could play Tetris against another? Well, in the origianl, you had to have a buddy who had a link cabe, a gameboy and a copy of tetris to play. You still have to do that in this versian, but you can also challenge the computer to matches, and it will send you garabge blocks just like it would if you were playing one of your friends. You can set the difficulty three levels, and the higher you set it, the more aggressive the computer becomes.Also, my main complaint with Tetris Worlds was there was no scoring feature, but this versian has plenty, and even saves the when you turn off the game. Not even the original did that! (At least, not in my gb game)There is the view next piece feature, but you can turn it off if you wish, but there is noinfinate rotate feature, or ghost/shadow piece to let you see when to drop it.I was very disappointed with the gba Tetris Worlds, and it's funny that I should tell people to go buy this instead of the gba game, but this one is worth the purchase, folks!Get this, and forget there ever was a Tetris Worlds, as this one improves over the original in almost all ways (exept the music..I would have liked the russian tetris music, instead we get this weird techno-pop music.)",5,Improves over the original,1143244800,"03 25, 2006",0.4282

Although I love the Puyo Puyo style games (Dr. Mario, Columns, Bust A Move, etc.), I have to say that Tetris is the cream of the crop. After all, Tetris is what sold the original Gameboy, and it was logical to make Tetris DX a launch title when the Game Boy Color came out. I bought the GBC the day it was released, and I bought Tetris DX the next week, and Tetris DX is one of the most-played titles on my GBC...the sheer addictiveness of the game is so frickin' awesome, and I love how blocks fall faster in later levels (so it has an 1980's old-school style to it...I love &quot;old school&quot; games).",5,the best puzzle game ever made,989971200,"05 16, 2001",0.229

Tetris worlds my not have a Battery Back-up, but it more than makes up for that with the extremely fun game variations and the classic tetris Music.Tetris DX DOES Have a battery, but it's just basic tetris. I'm able to score at least 400,000 points regularly, so every time I top out I have to put up with that annoying rocket launch sequence, wheras with Tetris Worlds, when you top out, you can start the next game right away without having to put up with annoying rocket sequences. the bottom line: went I want to play Classic Tetris, I play Tetris DX. when I want Enhanced graphics and effects and Nostalgic Music, I play Tetris Worlds",5,Great Tetris Game!,1032307200,"09 18, 2002",0.1677
3,A36UKFV79879MD,B00000IWYS,BX Lounger,"[0, 0]","When the original Game Boy launched in 1989, Tetris was the pack in cartridge that introduced the world to one of the most recognized games ever. Almost ten years later, right after the release of the Game Boy Color, Nintendo releases a colorful port of an addictive puzzle game we came to know and love. Tetris DX is the original Game Boy Tetris now in color and adds two more game modes and 2 player VS support. It was still great to play as it is now.Everyone knows what Tetris is so I won't explain it as many other reviewers have done so already. Tetris DX gets the full color support and has three game modes: Marathon (keep playing until it's game over), Ultra (score as many points as you can in 3 minutes) and 40 Lines (clear 40 lines as fast as you can.) You can connect another Game Boy Color from another player and play against him/her and even send your high scores over to his/her copy of the game.It's a great game overall with lots of re playability. If you had friends, then it was twice as fun to play against the other person and see who gets the highest score. Though nowadays, there are better versions of Tetris on the market, this will always remain a classic. It was a treat for Game Boy Color owners and was one game everyone got into.",5,Color port of the original GB game,1317168000,"09 28, 2011",0.4618

I had the Tetris Gold Collection from Spectrum Holobyte CD for Windows, and I didn't think I would like this one, but it hooked me! You can change the music, pause the game and it keeps 3 of your highest scores. Very addictive and enjoyable!",5,"Fast, furious and fun!",964915200,"07 30, 2000",0.3662
5,A3JAC6SHDBYJ4T,B00000IWYS,mister_music,"[10, 10]","Tetris DX is a very fun game! You will be addicted to it in no time! There are many different things you can do to change the game settings. For example, you can change the music. You can also change the level you are on yourself, although I wouldn't recommend doing it until after you have become a very good player. There also many game modes you can play in, like 40 Lines, on which you have to get 40 lines without your blocks hitting the top, Marathon, on which you just keep going and going and going until your blocks hit the top, or Ultra, where you see how good you can do, except you only have 3 minutes to do so. The computer also keeps track of your best records and displays them when you are choosing your level. Tetris DX is an absolutely terrific game! I would recommend it to anybody! You'll have a lot of fun playing it. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped.",5,Very addictive!,977961600,"12 28, 2000",0.2087
6,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00000IWYS,R.A. McKenzie,"[1, 1]","TETRIS is a videogame that needs no introduction. You probably know how to play it, and if you don't, I'm sure there's some sort of free online download that'll get you started.What makes TETRIS DX my personal favorite of all the iterations is that it gets the extra details just right. The music is solid, and while I prefer the NES version's tracks, this version's music is pretty good.The colors are beautiful. The game changes backgrounds as you advance in the game. I strongly recommend a Game Boy Advance SP, because seeing this game nowadays is trickier than it used to be. (That bloody DS has spoiled us!)The sound effects on the gaming board never grow old. That might not seem important, but since you're gonna be rotating pieces and forming lines and Tetris-es non-stop, you'll be grateful.The post-game rocket launches (there are about 7, the higher score the more elaborate the launch) are nice additions. What's pretty funny is that with the exception of the best spaceship launch, all the others fail for silly reasons. The weakest one gets distracted by a bird, and just flies off the left side of the screen!There are 3 save game slots, and a Guest file. So, all your hard work will never be erased. I think even a Guest's high scores will be saved, as long as it topples the saved files. But in any event, this is a very user-friendly game.There are 4 modes of gameplay. Classic is your traditional game of TETRIS. Ultra is the same as Classic, but the gaming board is shorter. 40 Lines is just trying to clear 40 lines as fast as possible, with some obstacle pieces thrown in. Aside from the regular Classic mode, VS.COM is my favorite, because when facing an offscreen opponent on Hard difficulty, you better bring your A-game. Classic and VS are endlessly fun, while the other two features are decent additions.Unfortunately, you will need some old-school Game Boy link cables to play with 2 human people. If competition against live opponents is what you crave, then getting TETRIS DS or the console versions is the way to go.But if you're a solo player, I believe TETRIS DX is the absolute best. The game just has a smooth flow to it. I loved the DS version, but hated that the Classic mode stopped after 200 lines. Because of the DS version's other unique features, that's also well worth your time and money.It's also worth mentioning that even though this game is advertised as a Game Boy Color, it'll play just fine the old-school Game Boy. I'm not sure about the Game Boy Advance units, though.TETRIS DX is easily the best choice if you're looking for old-school TETRIS with the best available presentation AND limitless single-player gaming. Grab a Game Boy, and have some fun. It won't cost much.",5,The Best Version For Single Players,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",0.1739
