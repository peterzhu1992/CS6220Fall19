But this game is just excellent, one of the best licensed games I've had the joy of seeing.Unless you own a controller pak you can't save the game, and the controls can be hard to understand at first but it's an excellent game.",5,An excellent first person shooter.,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",0.122

3,A138826JMC0J3T,B00000I1BB,E. Batica,"[1, 1]","South Park the video game is all right. I don't think it's smash worthy but I really don't think it's flush worthy either because it did probably one of the smarter things and totally copied 007 GoldenEye and gave it a total South Park twist.As usual, weird stuff is happening around South Park like mad, killer turkeys are attacking the city, strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest 8 year olds on the planet Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman on this strange, vulger and very gratuitous journey.I gotta say it, the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through, especially if you ran across the Terrance and Phillip bombs! Other than that, I really didn't feel there was much else besides all the cool codes (like all the weapons codes and stuff) and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like Officer Barbrady, Mr. Mackey (M'kay), Terrance and Phillip and if you really wanted to, Starvin' Marvin.The story is really silly but then again, when is there an episode of South Park that isn't just plain out ridiculous? Exactly. The controls are pretty easy too. You can set it to GoldenEye style of control or for you advanced users, you can use a Turok type of control.I still gotta say that I wouldn't play it for it's story mode. Personally, I'd play it for it's multiplayer mode because that's what the game is really good at! That and I personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modes.For you parents, most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few &quot;choice&quot; phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids. For those of you that don't have to worry about that, order a pizza, call over a few friends and throw on some South Park multiplayer. Have fun!",4,Really silly,1036540800,"11 6, 2002",0.1897

5,AV56CQTOGFTCJ,B00000I1BB,Incredible Fulk,"[0, 0]",This is truly a funny game. It captures the feel of South Park with it's cartoony style. The weapons are funny like snowballs (2nd fire- yellow snowballs) to plungers. The voices from the show are funny.

8,A1OYBF92TASIWN,B00000I1BB,Mike Brennan,"[1, 1]","This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it.

The controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use (you have to use the C buttons most of the time), the gameplay is repetitive and boring (all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys), and the multiplayer part is boring too. One pro is that the guns are pretty original &amp; the South Park kids say some funny things, but the novelty wears off after a while. I bought this game when it first came out, for ..., and I sold it for $5 at a stoop sale... I just wanted to get rid of it, it's really that bad. If you really have to get it, at least rent it first.",2,Worst game I've ever played...,979689600,"01 17, 2001",-0.1887
10,A3713PP4MADKED,B00000I1BB,Nick Watkins Nick Watkins,"[2, 2]","Sure, this game's been out for alomost four years now, but it's time I reviewed it. The exceptionally popular foul-mouth TV shows based on the fictional, yet epic adventures of Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and (the now removed) Kenny, four innocent little third graders (now fourth) in the snowy, mountain town of Colorado. It's a wonderful life; you have a gay teacher, a pimp-daddy chef, a best friend who dies more than 10 times a week, and all the Cheesy Poofs you could ever want. At least, until, killer turkeys, aliens, clones, and toys invade your town and try to take it over. YOU and YOU alon must prevent these attacks (or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt, but then the game's no fun).Like all shooter's, I only enjoy this game with cheats. The master cheat for this game is BOBBYBIRD, or, if you break it down, BOBBY BIRD. It unlocks every weapon, level, and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this game.In single-player, you assume the role of either Stan, Cartman, Kenny, or who I always pick, Kyle. Each comes with their own insults and comments. As you progress, you find Kenny, Cartman, and Stan, and they come with you, but you can't play as or with them. They just allow you to hold more weapons and item (I guess that's because it's four pairs of hands). Your first mission is to destroy the turkeys; and ultimatly, the gigantic, robo-turkey. Without cheats, you start with a snowball, or you can advance it, and make it a yellow snowball (and if you've seen Jackass, you know what that is). The other weapons are a cow launcher, a toy-machine gun, and more. Sooooo much more.This game is a good game, but only if you're a fan of the TV show. Even though it would be fun if some people weren't, they'd still annoy everyone, complaining of bad language and foul humor. Ignore them. If you're a fan, get this, or at least rent it.

11,A3IBXED14SKZ8Y,B00000I1BB,Robert Evans Robert,"[4, 4]",This N64 title was exclusive for N64 at one point but that doesn't really matter. South Park 64 looked really promising at first and it truly was with it's shocking yet really great graphics some what game play. And I was looking forward to one of the things South Park is best at. Stupid Funny plot. It kina had one but ends up failing AND I LOVE SOUTH PARK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS OUT THERE. But for a game it's just..AVERAGE. Nothing new just run and gun but I liked the whole senario stories like the visitors and the Turkey episodes. Those were great. The game starts off really well as you battle your way through vicious Turkeys but once you beat the Turkey boss it just drags on with the same ol run n' gun and then fight the boss with nothing New. It's just the same ol' same ol.Graphics are really good and one of the best on the N64. It really shows what the N64 can do. One of the best parts are the bosses cause there 3d animation is sooooo good. But that is just it...Graphics... Now lets get to the problemGameplay gets really boring after awhile. Really...It's just the same ol same ol but the game is great for Die Hard SouthPark Fans. I thought the game could have bin better but hey It wasn't But They still try to do a good job. But still...Gameplay is just a lil boring..Sound is perfect...Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a great job as teh voices of those crazy boys. Sound is great ok!ProsGraphicsSoundVoicesConsGameplay is just way to boring and a bit tediousSeems like playing the first Episode over againThe ending is sooo crappy I was really expecting something big and cool but just same lame ending...Then again it's just a game based on a show but seriously.Over all I give it ....a3.2 out of 5 starsGet this game at your own risk but I recomend Chef's lUv shack...Much much betta and fun mini games.Lates,3,Great show for an average game..just...average,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",0.3063

13,A2WTO0ST2SUUY9,B00000I1BB,wblumrosen,"[0, 0]","Now, being a big fan of the hit TV show, I was a little skeptical at first if the game would bring down the integrity of the show, but in the end it did not. South Park isn't a great game, but if you love the show you will definitely enjoy it. You can chose between the four main characters: Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny. Usually, I pick Cartman because he is the funniest one out of the group and has the best insults. They implemented the same humor they use in their TV show, so the sound samples keep you the most entertained. The point of the game is to save your town from evil turkeys, aliens, toys, clones, and what not. Each level gets kind of repetitive, so the game can be a little boring. There is not much variety to it, but let me reiterate that the voice samples do and will keep you entertained. I give this game credit for the humor, sound, creativity, and graphics, but it lacks in level design and keeping the gamer entertained through other means rather than sound.Overall, I rate this game a 3 out of 5 because although its cleaver and funny, the actual game play of the game is not that exciting. If I wanted humor, then I could just turn on the show.",3,South Park Review,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",0.3403
