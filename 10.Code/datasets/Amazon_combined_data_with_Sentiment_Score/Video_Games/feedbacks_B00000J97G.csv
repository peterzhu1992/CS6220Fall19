0,A1H9SWNKX6N260,B00000J97G,Aaron,"[13, 13]","I bought this color, Teal, because I liked teal very much. Other than that, this console has improved on its graphics! On games like Super Mario Bros. Deluxe and Pokemon Gold and Silver, the graphics are much better! Also, there is a ample amount of color that your eyes can feast on. Now if you have game boy Pocket and Regular game boy and you're playing Pokemon [It doesn't matter which one], you will notice that when you walk around in Pocket, It's very blurry. Well this fault has ben fixed in GameBoy Color. It's extremely helpful because it enables you to see more detail and little things that you couldn't see before. I also have some regular gameboy games that aren't for game boy color and if you play them on GameBoy color, they show little color, but no blurryness. Now make sure you read what the box says when you are buying a gameboy color game. There are two types, there is one that says FOR GAMEBOY COLOR ONLY, which you can't use on the other gameboys. The second type just says that it's for gameboy color. Those you can play on the regular gameboys. It won't show any color but at least you can play it. There are a couple faults for the gameboy color. One of which is that the console is too small [for me I have big fingers so it's hard for a grown up kid]. A second fault is that the batterys run out faster than the Original GameBoy [The gameboy pocket battery use is outrageous! I played the gameboy pocket for 2 hours straight and the batterys were already starting to run out[[I think it's because the console takes AAA's and they tend to run out fast]].]. The original gameboy lasted me up to 23 hours! This only lastes me for about 12. Well I can see why because of all the good color and good graphics. So my point is that this color gameboy, teal, is a good color to get [if you like it]. The console is worth the money too. It all combines. The color, graphics, games, to make a great system!",5,"Good Color, GOOD Console!",980467200,"01 26, 2001",0.2123

Well, a Game Boy Color is still an excellent product, and there are tons of games to choose from. Compared to the original Game Boy or the smaller version of the Game Boy (was it Game Boy light?) this one is great.I really like how this Game Boy Color runs for about 8 hours just off of two double-A batteries. If you want recommendations of Game Boy Games, look no further than the classics-Zelda (Oracle of Time and Ages), Super Mario, and Metroid. Another really cool game is Pokemon, and if you're not into it then you can find many other great varieties.This Game Boy Color is really reliable and stable. If you don't do anything really careless with it (like drop it in the toilet or hit it with a hammer, etc) it should last you many years. There are many different accessories you can get to enhance your gaming experience also.Game Boy Color is excellent, and if you haven't experienced it yet, then you should go and try it.",5,"Pretty stable, fun, and reliable.",982454400,"02 18, 2001",0.4724

Besides the main feature of processing 32,000 colors with specially designed games, the GBC is backwards compatible with classic monochrome Game Boy titles, though you can play with different palettes by tinkering with the face buttons when the title screen appears. Also, though the system's slimmed-down design is pretty convenient for pocket games, it's a bit too narrow for big hands. It offers no shortage in battery power, and the AC outlet at the bottom provides extended play with the right adapter. The biggest oddity on the handheld (for me) is that you raise the volume by turning the switch down instead of up. As for the GBC's less-than-stellar resolution, after discovering the Japanese-exclusive Game Boy Light, there's no excuse for having to find a proper light source.This system is recommended for players over 7.",3,"Game Boy, in Technicolor!",1371859200,"06 22, 2013",0.3144

In the summer of 2000,I bought Pokemon Stadium for N64 because I had just taken an interest. I did not know you needed the gameboy games(pretty stupid of me,eh?). So we bought me a kiwi colored gameboy color(too bad they had no berry color,but kiwi is just as pretty!). Along with it,I gotmy first game,Pokemon Yellow. And boy was it more than I expected. I played it hours on end! I could not put it down! I took it everywhere,in the car,resterants,grandparents',etc etc etc. It really spiced upmy summer. I kept on sticking to Pokemon games but soon I discovered more great games such as Zelda and Harvest Moon plus tins of others. I even think I enjoy it more than any other console I own(me and my brother practicly own all the systems(gamecube,PS2,dreamcast,n64,etc,etc). The batteries last a good 20 hours or so too,which is great for traveling. Yes,the gameboy advance may be out there too,and i bought one of those,but I almost think that I enjoy this more. I think gameboy color games seem to be more addicting and there are a lot more out at the present.I think the gameboy color is cooler looking than the GBA! Another great feature is that you can plug headphones in so you can play with sound without disturbing other people.

Technically, although the NGP was 16-bit, there doesn't seem to be much difference, and in any case it's the quality of the games that's important. This is the Game Boy's strength - it has an enormous, ever-growing range of games, some of which is excellent (the third 'Wario' game, for example, or 'R-Type DX', a faithful recreation of 'R-Type' on a tiny screen). There are some more esoteric applications, too, including a camera, a sonar (really), productivity software, and a sequencer (as used on Alec Empire's 'We Punk Einheit').As a possession, it's highly desirable - it's small, stylish and easy to hold, and apart from the fragile battery cover, it seems very solid. It's slightly bulkier than the Game Boy Pocket, but not off-puttingly so, and keenly-priced, too.

Just look at the guide for your game and you will see that their are very little manuavers and they will be easy to use.Besides all of those reasons, the number one reason the Game Boy is so popular is because it is portable.

I remember opening it up for the first time, and had no idea how to turn it on, and when I figured it out, I was so excited. I've had this thing for many many years and it still works great. The only thing thats messed up really is the way the sound works. Like, if I turn the sound circle thing all the way to the max, its less sound then it was at a little before that point. But something I like is it has a headphone jack in it, which the GBA SP Lite does not. I'm not sure if the original SP did or not, but I like using my earphones when I play a game, so thats a major plus for me. Also, I did loose the back at one point but we bought a different back at a flea market, and it fit just fine. Mine is the purple one, and sure, its got quite a few scratches, dings and dents, but I still play it every now and then, because its a classic, and I loves me some Pokemon Crystal, :).",5,Have had it for nearly 10 years.,1329091200,"02 13, 2012",0.3319
