A game can have pretty graphics sound great, and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like [...]. This game might not be as pretty as the Saturn version, but who wants a Saturn? One of the biggest flops since the future flop of Sony's [...]PS3. A few frames missing and slowdown which I have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines X-men with Streetfighter very well. One more thing to mention about the price. Not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand. It is discontinued, there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in value.",4,Great for many of the reasons other reviewers are calling it bad,1147996800,"05 19, 2006",0.1378
1,A2GAP7XWBZU8QI,B000006OVK,Eric,"[10, 10]","I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart, and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS! Why? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it. It did not have enough RAM (Random Access Memory) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM, and the PS1 only has 32 MB. If Capcom did put in tag-team, then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it, you can tag-team with the same character, but it does not feel the same.I suggest get a Saturn, (it is only $10 bucks or less) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com, or any Video game store, and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter, trust me you wont be disappointed.",2,What was Capcom thinking?,1069286400,"11 20, 2003",0.1069
2,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B000006OVK,J. Paul John doe,"[1, 1]",X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade.,4,200th review X Men vs Street Fighter for SEGA SATURN,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",-0.1661
3,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B000006OVK,N. Durham Big Evil,"[2, 2]","To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly. What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight. This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted. It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown. If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time.",2,Butchered arcade to home conversion,1107129600,"01 31, 2005",0.3637

6,AQMWZIH22R6LE,B000006OVK,TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore,"[2, 3]","When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game, one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system. But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money, Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, on the PlayStation. The only thing added to the game is super cancels, which allow you to string multiple super combos together. Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought, so some characters' cancels work better than others. In fact, the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought. Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game, the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible, unbalanced, pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game.One of the few things the arcade version (and the Saturn version, which was an arcade-perfect translation) had going for it was the graphics. They weren't spectacular, but the characters were large, colorful, and used a lot of frames of animation. The PlayStation, a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D, simply can't handle that much data. So Capcom chopped out tons of frames (Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still, and his attacks are about two frames). The graphics look very washed out, and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown. Ken's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out, and it still slows the game down to a crawl. The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay.The arcade version's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight. Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack, as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks. Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory, the tag feature has been completely removed. You still pick a second character (cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version), but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters. To make up for the shortened play time, the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format. Characters also slowly regain life, much like your backup character would in the arcade.This game just shouldn't exist. At some point in the development cycle, someone should have stepped in, seen that the PlayStation simply couldn't do justice to the original game, and pulled the plug. It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn, which already has more RAM than the PlayStation, to run a perfect version of the game. I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy, but this is taking it way too far.",2,This game is bad,1060732800,"08 13, 2003",0.0326
