1,A2UAOP0VUA12EQ,B000006OVI,Sam Allen A zealous individual,"[2, 2]","Street Fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series. Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridge/disc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections, then do so and spend a ton of cash. They are all excellent titles, but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect. Street Fighter Collection, the original that is in the spotlight, is actually the more up-to-date one. While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II, it does contain 3 classic Street Fighter games. First is Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers, released on SNES and Genesis in 1994. It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it. It had a solid 16 fighters. All 8 from Street Fighter II, the bosses, plus 4 new characters never heard of before: Cammy, Dee Jay, Fei Long, and T. Hawk. You might think, Oh wow, a new edition with new fighters. Never seen THAT before. Well, you're wrong. Super Street Fighter II did contain 4 new arenas (respectively the ones for the new fighters). It also had newly mixed music, newly animated profile shots, and newly animated backgrounds. Basically, it was a perfect upgrade. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included. It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo, but it added something. Each character had one SUPER MOVE. From Ryu and Ken's Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Li's Kikousho, they really gave a great new edge to the series. Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade. Also, the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games, Street Fighter Alpha 2, gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold Edition. Cammy is added on, and Evil Ryu becomes playable (YAY!). What's strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFII:CE animation. So it's definetely worth picking this up...if you don't already have all three of these games for your SNES (Alpha 2 is also on the PS).",5,I need this and the second one,1150502400,"06 17, 2006",0.3009
2,A1LEN6BO4XR1DI,B000006OVI,Sean Shannon,"[10, 11]","Forgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and 3-D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken, the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze. Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws, Street Fighter II's strength was superb, well-balanced, uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master. Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay, making for an excellent anthology, but not a flawless one.Firstly, the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring. Given the lack of complexity of those games, one has to wonder if Capcom's developers were too lazy (or their marketers too greedy) to finish those titles for this release, instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II. Graphically the games are preserved admirably, although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up, unlike in the arcade games. The long load times are excruciating, as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block, when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block.The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is nice, but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection. Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 to market, and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation. And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block, Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all, not one as is advertised on the packaging.Still, all three games have withstood the test of time, and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value. But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a whole.",4,Great Games but Adaptation Leaves Something to Be Desired,986947200,"04 11, 2001",-0.011
3,AQMWZIH22R6LE,B000006OVI,TwistaG Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore,"[2, 3]","The sheer number of games bearing some form of the name &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; is staggering. So when Capcom announced that it was putting together a compilation of Street Fighter games, I was stoked. My excitement quickly cooled when I discovered the true nature of Capcom's package. Street Fighter Collection contains Super Street Fighter 2, Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo, and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold, a slightly updated version of Street Fighter Alpha 2. The original Street Fighter 2, Champion Edition, and Hyper Fighting are nowhere to be found. The result is a shallow package that should have been so much more. The graphics and gameplay in the Super games are almost identical to what you remember. Every frame of original animation appears intact, and there isn't any noticeable slowdown. However, the graphics do appear a bit fuzzy. The sound is decent, and the music even speeds up and intensifies when a character is near death. The second disc contains Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. The game is almost entirely identical to Street Fighter Alpha 2, with only a few differences. First, any character that was in Street Fighter 2 Champion Edition can switch between normal and Champion Edition modes. Playing a CE version of a character disables his super meter and changes a few moves here and there. The CE character graphics are still Alpha 2-style. Also, there is now an Akuma mode, which pits your character against Akuma over and over again instead of fighting all the other characters. Also, Cammy is hidden in the game. She appears in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter costume. All this is fine and good, but what about all the other great Street Fighter games? Where's SF2 Turbo: Hyper Fighting? Or the original SF2, complete with Guile's &quot;handcuffs&quot; and all the other weird little glitches? Capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a &quot;collection&quot; that is obscenely incomplete. If you're really itching to play SSF2 or SSF2T, this package is right up your alley. But fans hoping for a complete collection must keep on waiting.",3,Good but not great,1060732800,"08 13, 2003",0.3015
4,A155BURC4779CK,B000006OVI,Zachary S. Game On!,"[7, 7]","The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved. If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold. Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added. 1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos.Lets go over it:1st - classic with no supers lots of characters2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for eachNot only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.",5,One thing people are missing to consider about this game!,1072569600,"12 28, 2003",0.6267
