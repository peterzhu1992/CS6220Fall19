For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics,better realism, and better everything. If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert. Even though it looks pretty good, after about a week you won't want to play it anymore. With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it. Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there &quot;Red Alert&quot; and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much.",1,Don't Even Think About Getting This Game,958262400,"05 14, 2000",0.2718

The orginal command and conquer storyline was way better. The GDI missions are a joke in this game and I have to say it...NOD RULEZ! The NOD missions are very fun to look at and play especially the evil HAL computer that talks to you in the cool voice. The game play units are completely unbalanced! On GDI side, all you have to do is amass a huge army of Tank Mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is. On the NOD side, amass a huge army of 30 mobile artillery and nobody can stand in your way. The game is worth buying to see how it looks, but the gameplay is horrible and some of the missions are close to impossible which may frustrate some novice players.

I got this game when I wasn't playing much else apart from EVERQUEST, upon a friends recommendation. I wasn't to familiar with the C&amp;C franchise of RTS games from Westwood. Now I am a fan of the series.If you don't know, TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another. The evil NOD, that wants to rule the world, while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world. The single player missions are on two discs. One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions. Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay. I can't say I liked the full-motion-video sequences, but they are quite funny in an unintentional way!The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at! There just is no way to describe winning a long 2 hour match online and not getting booted off!This is a good value for the money. It may not be as great as AGE OF EMPIRES or STARCRAFT, but TIBERIAN SUN is fun nonetheless. Enjoy!",4,Great fun! Many hours of enjoyment.,988070400,"04 24, 2001",0.3573

8,A1C9BHKF30GZZJ,B00000DMA8,Marc,"[0, 1]","All right, the graphics are nice and the terrain damage is something new, but that doesn't make up for the gameplay, which could be summed up in one word:SLOW.Skirmishes take a real long time to get going; I mean, at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force. And then what do you find yourself doing? Protecting your base with them, and attacking with missle launches. I'm dead serious, the only way to attack is with missle launches. To attack with your men (Especially tanks) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base!That being said, the multiplayer is a total waste of time. If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers, consider yourself lucky. Don't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved, when you or your opponent loses his/her connection. And don't consider engineering a cheap way to attack, it's the only way anyone attacks...THe campaign is allright I guess, if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene (Which aren't as good as Red Alerts were)..... Come on, you can't tell me NOD doesn't have a huge advantage over GDI. They do.Let's hope Kane bites the dust soon, before the C&amp;C series turns as twisted as &quot;The Forgotten&quot;.",2,*Your Connection to Westwood Online has been lost*,984700800,"03 16, 2001",-0.3249

There are some interesting new units, and I did enjoy the much larger maps. My biggest complaint is that it is so short. You are just getting to use some of the more advanced units and the game is over. You never get the big final battle like at the end of the last two incarnations. This is by far the shortest game of the bunch. I finished each side's campaign over the course of three nights, about 9-12 hours of game play.",3,More of the same,1001548800,"09 27, 2001",0.1006
10,A2MQ5O07UDJDOA,B00000DMA8,R. Khan,"[0, 0]","Well, it seems that those idiots who gave TS a low rating was because they thought TS reused Red Alerts units. That is completely wrong . TS is set in a futuristic world with advanced units. Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the original C&amp;C and was set throughout the Cold War. TS does not use standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in the year TS took place which was 2030. This is especially true with GDI and there titans, disruptors, firestrom defense, rpg towers, MMK II and a whole lot more. Nod has has the cyborgs, underground units, and and the banshee aircraft etc. Now, are these the same units from RA, i dont think so. Westwood retained a couple of units from the original C&amp;C such as the devil's tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these units to please gamers. Nothing from this game was copied from RA- trust me. As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt. I personally hate that game. Its way more complex to understand than TS simple interface, no deformidable terrain, you have to RIGHT CLICK to deselect units (very awkward), structures take extremely long to build - as well as units, those same structures look like they have legs(terran barracks and engineering bay). I also have no idea what the storyline is about (no real actors - jus bad FMVs).I could name a whole lot more but it would take up too much space in this review. The only single thing i like is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games. Sure, Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people just like the old C&amp;C. some people ask for too much in a sequel and when they find what they havent been looking for, they disgrace the game. We'll see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now, if youre a serious fan of C&amp;C's then pick up a copy of TS- you'll find an intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time favs that would have remembered.",5,Not a copycat of Red Alert; better than Starcraft,964224000,"07 22, 2000",0.14

I don't understand why some people are so crushed when their &quot;favorite&quot; game series puts out a bad game. It's not that big of a deal. For all you Red Alert buffs, Red Alert 2 will be out soon so chill out for a minute. There are a ton of different strategies to play this game with so it becomes extremely addictive. Once you get the basics down ... the sky is pretty much the limit on strategies you can use so this adds replay value to the game. It will definitely keep you busy until the next installment by Westwood. The online play is great and easy to use.

13,A2GEB05H8G2Z5A,B00000DMA8,Rolltide,"[4, 4]","I just don't understand those who want to give this game low marks. This is a game that when modified with the numerous free online downloads is as good a game as any out there.To start this game is a sequel to command and conquer not red alert which is the much more popular westwood game. That was a problem for some who just assumed that westwood would come out with a red alert sequel first. Never the less there are features in this game that improve upon the original. The original CnC did not allow for skirmish play against the Al opponent only missions. This game does allow multiplayer play and the Al is very competitive at the more difficult levels. There are some other small extras as well such as more colors to choose from and the oppportunity to make a map right at the game menu. Just set your specifications and it makes a map that's meets those specs. One new feature i love is the option for a deployable mcv. This allows you to start a base and then move your command center to another area. This game is also much more strategic then the originas CnC. The maps are spectacular with many cliffs, ridges and rivers and lakes. No game has better maps and terrain. I wish i could say the same about the units though. While the structures are creative and attractive the units look down right bizarre and cartoonish. Some may like this but i don't. The colors of the units and structures are rich and pleasant but some units are too strange looking to enjoy. The infantry look alright but the tanks take some getting used to. Another unfortunate aspect of the game is that the nod is given the more strategic interesting units. The gdi has more size and firpower while the nod is more sneaky with it's burrowing apcs and missles. One feature i like is the infantryman. The disc throwers for the gdi or the rocket guys for the nod have armor that makes them much more competitive in battles than a rocket guy or grenade guy in red alert. You can't just run over these infantrymen. A group of 10 disc throwers can do serious damage to a camp if allowed to sneak in or they can quickly do away with a harvester. The basic play is bascially the same as CnC or red alert but there are enough new features here to make it a worthwhile purchase at $20.Overall i would rate the stock tiberian game that comes from the store as a 3.7 to 3.8 stars. A good solid game. What makes this a truly great game is the numerous free downloads and upgrades available both at westwood.com and many other sites. On the program menu for the game is an upgrade option from westwood that helps to work out some of the bugs and improves the game. In addition there are literally dozens of web-sites devoted entirely or in part to this game that provides an incredible array of free downloads that provide game modifications, new maps, units and game tips ect. Also included are opportunites to join klans and clubs, things that really enhance the enjoyment of the game. One download called &quot;resistance 2.0&quot; will add 50% more speed and firepower and will double the number of units and structures. You can find this download at tsden.com. It is these additional modifications and options that convert a good game into a fantastic game. These upgrades and downloads are absolutely free and require very little time, effort or computer savyness to add and if you're ambitious you can do your own modifications.The only complaint i would have of my modified game is that there is no navy. All these wonderful maps with water but no opportunity to make destroyers or crusiers like in red alert or total annililation..................socks",5,Great game!!!!!!,982281600,"02 16, 2001",0.2915

However most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to Red Alert. This is simply not true. The two games have almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game. In saying this I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay from Red Alert. Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring helicopters and cheap &quot;hover units&quot;.However this game is not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics, featuring performances by several Hollywood stars (well maybe not stars but close enough). The graphics are pretty good but other games have done better.Sure it's a classic and if you really like the series go ahead and buy it.

I have to admit, it is better than some games I have already played, but it just didn't have the zing of the other C&amp;C games.The computer stinks. I could beat them playing as GDI(good guys), which is hard because NOD(bad guys) has all the best vehicles, units, and structures. I love the Missile Silo. Talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent!! If you want to have about a 65% chance of winning, stick with NOD.I wouldn't recommend the missions, because they are all too easy or all too hard. I stick to skirmish and internet games myself.I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look.

16,A2O8NWM7V0B6BQ,B00000DMA8,ShyGuy1966,"[2, 2]","Remember Command and Conquer, the real-time strategy that lets you build a base, a lot of units and rush the opposing force? You'd think the developers of the original would come up with some innovative game play for the sequel. While maybe they can, they didn't here. Not only is the game play unchanged, it suffers from a weak story, poor balancing and computer AI and several small problems.The single player campaign story, what there is of it, is just a jumble of scenarios without much to tie them together. There are characters and things happen to them but but there isn't a story progression to follow. You fight over here, you fight over there, then it's the final battle. In fact I reached the end of the GDI campaign without realizing it. The live video cut-scenes should have helped create a rich back-story but writing this I can't remember any of it.There are balance issues particularly with NOD units and structures. A NOD 'super laser' structure can destroy almost anything with one shot but the NOD artillery is completely unbalanced. With a long range and a big punch, the artillery is can wipe out any ground force, and is unstoppable even in small numbers as long as a small anti-air backup is nearby.The computer is an easy opponent. It doesn't rush but sending units at piecemeal, a handful at a time. It doesn't protect it's harvesters either, once you locate them it's easy to cut-off the computer's resources. The computer showed some initiative just once: During a NOD scenario several GDI engineers rushed my base taking several of my structures. I was so surprised it nearly wiped me out but building a good perimeter stopped later rushes. In the scenarios that followed the engineer rush never happened again. I didn't try any higher difficulty levels, maybe the computer plays better there.Large maps are hard to manage, the game tell you that an offscreen unit is lost but not where the unit is. Some scenarios seem designed to simply frustrate you with a huge map and a timed objective with no direction as to where to accomplish it. In the end the game is all about the mass rush, once you build 50 or medium strength units nothing the computer can't stop you. On the technical side this game ran perfectly on Windows 2000.If you're looking for more of the original Command and Conquer this game's for you.",3,Same as the original,1108512000,"02 16, 2005",0.1108
