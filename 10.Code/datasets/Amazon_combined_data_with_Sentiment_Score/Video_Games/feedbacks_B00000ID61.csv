When the game transitioned making it's way onto the Nintendo 64 I had to hail the calling of this game and buy it, so I did. The result? I was as happy as any person could have been after spending the money for this game, and it was worth it. The game is easy to beat, but, only on the easy route. There are hundreds of ways that give this game a replay value that could be unmatched at the time, such as getting medals for every planet in the &quot;Galaxy&quot; in order to unlock expert mode, or the ability to win tanks in multiplayer mode, or even be able to fight on foot.

The arcade and score-based gameplay alone means competitive revisits, and you can absorb a complete experience in a reasonable timeframe, like a good TV show. Even with the kid friendly premise, there is a sense of true emotion between the characters. You care about Fox, his team, and the strife they encounter. Most of all, this game has yet to be topped for its kind - the closest they got was the 3DS remake, but even that isn't a whole new game (plus the voices were way better in this one).",5,In a word: timeless.,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",0.6141

4,A2OUKHGJ85XN4U,B00000ID61,Charles H.,"[0, 0]","Gameplay: You play Fox McCloud, a fighter pilot for Starfox, and you're at war with the forces of the evil Andross. It's more or less a rail shooter, but there's some free-roaming flight to be had at various points through the game. One of the best features of Starfox is that progression is non-linear. Your actions in each mission directly affect how you proceed through the game. For instance, if you defuse the bomb on one level, you go one route. If you fail, you end up playing a different level.Graphics: You have to be a little forgiving of Starfox in this area. It's a fairly early N64 game. In the grand scheme of N64 graphical quality, Starfox 64 is probably somewhere near the bottom. But if you're turning down the new 3DS Starfox in favor of the old school one released fifteen years ago, chances are you won't care about that.Sound: The music is pretty good, as is the voice-acting. Although it lacks the polish and natural feel of some later N64 games with voice-acting, Starfox 64 still has one of the best uses of voice-acting on the system. Flying through space shooting aliens and talking on a radio to your teammates go hand in hand.There's still a lot of fun to be had with Starfox, even after all this time.

8,A2290OIJTU42QP,B00000ID61,Female Spy,"[2, 2]","*The title is a quote from the final boss, Andross*A more accurate rating for this game, overall, is really 4.5 stars; but, of course, Amazon won't let you grade in half stars. A true masterpiece, Starfox 64 stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the Nintendo 64, and perhaps even all time. I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title; and, though I'm normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this, this game succeeded in impressing! Analyzing its features step by step, it's pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldn't be loved:Storyline 10/10: The story is absolutely captivating! Though it starts out pretty simple and generic (the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom, someone save us, etc.) the backstory behind it is pretty detailed, the intro is epic, and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing! Actually, YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree: you can pretty much decide, through skill and/or choice, whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team, a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate. You control Fox McCloud, and only Fox McCloud, but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy, Slippy, and Falco; why, just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes! This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out what's happening.Characters 9/10: I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters: they make the game! Even on your own crew, each one is distinctive: Falco, for example, plays along the lines of the tough guy with a secretly caring heart. Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type, and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy. Finally, Fox, the same character you control, often takes on a reserved leadership role (which makes sense). Each one has his own quirks; and, though any of them can be annoying on a certain level, you can't help but feel a degree of liking for each of them. Their lines, though perhaps epic for the time, can be somewhat cheesy and/or cliche (Peppy's, It's Quiet . . . too quiet. is a good example); but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and light-hearted game. You often can't help but think, I shouldn't be laughing at this, but you'll laugh anyway. It's just that kind of game. The A.I. of each character on maneuvering is decent; but, until you get skilled enough, it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them, as they get in your way at the oddest times (then fuss at you when you do hit them). Peppy occasionally gives advice that doesn't particularly help either, though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it. Speaking of advice, though, the game can make you depend on your characters if you're newer at it, as they can each do something useful: Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot, Slippy analyzes boss health meters, and Falco often covers you. If someone gets shot down, you'll miss him. Finally, the characters are also pretty life-like in behavior: try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels, and listen to his reaction to it.Graphics 9/10: Some issues with fog (common for Nintendo 64 games), but otherwise absolutely beautiful. The fog itself, even, can be justified, as you spend most of your time in the air. Though many stages take either a purely generic spacial theme, such as the asteroid field, the planets are really intuitive. In this game you can find a volcanic environment, which even mimics the wavy effects of heat, an ocean environment (full of fish and plant life), a couple of cities, a train depot . . . the works! The most interesting graphics you could see, however, has to be the part of the asteroid field you can warp to. Though it probably looks like you've taken a medication or something else you shouldn't have, you can't deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level. . . . Please note, however, that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take; like the story, it's dependent upon your actions in the levels.Mechanics 9/10: This covers things like controls, ability to save, and learning curve (whether it's easy or hard to master). The controls, though they work well, are pretty complicated to learn. This complication, however, is eased by the nice training mode they threw in; a few rounds in training mode, and you'll pretty much have them down! The game can still be pretty tough to a degree, though; however, I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds (and I'm usually not too hot at games like this), before the Star Wolf team finished me off (they're pretty tough if you don't know how to handle them right). Make sure to master the somersault maneuver; I've never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one! In terms of saving, I was disappointed: there's no way to save; and, unlike what some people say, there's no password feature either. You'll probably get sick of the first level for that reason. While it's not a deal breaker, this game isn't for the busy person who's looking to play for only an hour or less and quit. If you want to experience the true value of this game, you'd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it. The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score, as I kept catching myself thinking, This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature!Music and Sound 10/10: No complaints in the music and sound department! It pretty much captures the mood, be it suspenseful, hopeful, dramatic, or even rewarding. The character voices are also well done, awesomely portraying the character personalities as well. I can't describe any of this justly, though; you'll have to listen for yourself!Conclusion: Star Fox 64 is a face of near perfection, if only a few small blemishes hadn't reared their ugly heads. Multiplayer, I hear, is lacking; but, overall, none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers. Personally, I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands; the replay value is great with its various paths! The final boss can be downright creepy, and . . . well, I think any critique could easily go on forever! Long story short, this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price it's at now. A fond memory in many gamers hearts, this Star Fox 64 still remains as a highly recommended game to play!",4,"If I Go Down, I'm Taking You with Me! (by Laura)",1258934400,"11 23, 2009",0.3086

I just love this game, it can be as hard as you want it to be so stop saying it's easy. Anyways, this game was put out 8 years ago and still every once and a while I decide to play this and I love it, cuase it has the talking animals on it. I'm going to repeat this TALKING ANIMALS! Slippy gets on my nerves though I just kill him becuase he always gets some guy on his ass and keeps bleating get this guy off my fox! I wanna crack his skull everytime he says that it pisses me off. Then theres that stupid chick that knows Falco (the bad ass of course) and she is annoying, I wish I could kill her becuase when you go to the Z zone she steals your kills so you can't get the freaking medal I HATE HER! It is so annoying that she steals your kills! Oh that has to be the worst part of the game, it's woefully madening. Also to not are the apes who try to kill you, though they make the noble animal of the ape villanious they still have memoriable lines like ANDROSS I'VE FAILED YOU!!! Then there is team wolf, they are tottaly bad! They are pretty hard to kill on the other side of venom but like I said if you got the skills you may one day beat them (and you say this game is too easy! OH MY GOSH!). Anyways I do like the bunny guy what's his name? I forgot but he's like Your the best Slippy. and that makes me want to cry becuase they are always so hard on Slippy! I love it that they actually give him love in Aquos cuase I've heard the stories, poor Slippy. Anyways Fox is a stud of course, damn he is looking good! He works hard of course, cuase I'm controlling him. Anyways the best characters are the bosses cuase they say stuff to you that's funny like that one boss admits defeat but then comes back after you cuase he was lying, what did you think you'd get off that easy! HECK NO! Anyways I hope you love this game as much as I do, becuase I say those lines everyday before I go to sleep, cause it bring hope. Especially when the Bunny guy affectionatly tells Fox your becoming more like your father. Fox's father was a pimp too! That's the ultimate compliment in the Lylat system! I'm sure Fox shed a tear when he heard that from his bunny partner. I'm out, only a loser doesn't like this game cuase he is a nerd with no sense of humor who wants to play a real flight simulator.

The Nintendo 64 proved that no mateer what a CD-ROM gaming system was able to do, a cartridged based gaming system could do better. That June, the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox 64. The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendo's Rumple Pak, a force-feedback device that let's players feel each and every vibration at hand.In the game, you play Fox McCloud, a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross, a inane, mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system. There are 15 remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game, alone over twenty-five different paths you decide on your way to Andross. The graphics are so realistic and full of promise, that you see the game so vividly, you feel like you're a part of it. In Starfox 64, you also have the use of 3 different vehicles, depending on your course, Arwing, Landmaster Tank, or the Blue Marine sub, only used in the Aquas sea level. The game also has a fierce battle level, for up to 4 players, where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders, Peppy, Falco, and Slippy.It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game, the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox 64.
