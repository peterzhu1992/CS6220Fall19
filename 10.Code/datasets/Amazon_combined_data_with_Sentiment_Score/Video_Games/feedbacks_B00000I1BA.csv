From exploding nukes, to mini howitzers, to the Flash being incarnated into a Tank. This game has it all. Call of Duty ain't got a thing on this beauty. You can kidnap queens, you can dominate the world map, you can even stand around like a pacifist and let yourself die. This game has what YOU want. This game has what YOU need. YOU MUST OBTAIN BATTLETANX!",5,Who doesn't love BattleTanx?,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",0.0706
2,A2OUKHGJ85XN4U,B00000I1BA,Charles H.,"[0, 0]","I picked this up the other day. It only took a few hours to finish the 1-player mode, but I suppose the fact that I'd previously played BattleTanx: Global Assault on PS1 helped me out a little.Story: Some virus gets out of control and eliminates 99.9% of the females on planet earth. This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl, and then the government comes and takes her away. Meanwhile, gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world. Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs.Gameplay: You play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock Abrams tank, blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing (or kidnapping???) women. Your tribal army needs women to stay in existence. Different gangs have different types of tanks. There are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles, guided missiles, lasers, and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas. Most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of Capture the Flag from any number of FPS games. BattleTanx's single-player is unique in that regard.Controls: They work pretty good. No complaints.Multiplayer: There's no co-op campaign. BOO! :P You can play through various types of matches (most of which resemble the single-player levels) against friends or the AI. You can use the tanks of enemy games in the multi-player. That's all good and well, I guess, but I know I can blow my friends to kingdom come. What I really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on 2 players.Graphics: They're early N64, but they look alright. I don't like the fact that your main tank in single-player looks so cartoony. The comic-style storytelling is unique, and I think they're way better than PS1 Global Assault's campy voice-acting.If you're a fan of the BattleTanx series, I suppose owning (what I assume is) the first entry is important. However, if I had to choose between this game and its sequel, I would choose the latter due to its better single-player campaign.",4,Pretty Fair,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",0.1435

5,AZXHK8IO25FL6,B00000I1BA,ribcage,"[3, 3]","Buy it. Play Battlelord mode with four teams, preferably on the Las Vegas map. That's about all you'd do anyway. Don't bother with the singleplayer, it's garbage. I didn't bother finishing it. I played the first five or six levels, I'd guess, and it was so easy and the story was so retarded that I just didn't care anymore. The multiplayer is where it's at. Totally intense. You play as different factions, each one with a slightly different tank set(there are only three kinds of tank--Goliath, the generic kind, and a super fast little one w/ only machine guns, the tankset just determines how many of each you'll get...some are only goliaths or the little ones, and things like that). Each faction also has a special starting weapon. Guided missiles(which are VERY good against base defenses since you don't have to go in there and get pelted) cloaking, shields, swarm missiles, etc.So, yeah, the multiplayer is simply amazing and the game is definitely cheap enough by now that if you see it you should buy it without question. Don't worry about the graphics. You won't notice when you're dodging guided missiles, goliath tanks, and mines trying to get the queenlord back to your base so you can win the round.Also, if you do get it, you might consider setting the control setup to DRIVER because the default control setup is kinda deplorable.",5,yes,1105228800,"01 9, 2005",0.2746
6,A3G44HT4IDEC4E,B00000I1BA,Videogamer1416 storynathan,"[0, 0]","This game is great. You can either duel it out with up to 3 of you're freinds(plus you) or do a single player campaign. Let me explain single player campaign first. A deadly virus kills 99% of women in the game and so the National Guard takes the reamaining women to a Quarantine Zone. In the game,you are Griffin Spade and you must rescue Madison from the Federal Relocation Forces(earlier reffered to as the National Guard). To progress in the game,you must destroy enemy tanks and bunkers,destroy enemy bases prior to rescueing the queenlords inside them(the last base is the Quarantine Zone in Snfrinsisco),take the queenlords to you're base via you're tank,earn new types of Tanks as you progress(Goliath,M1A1,and a minature one),gain ally tanks by earning points(note:you can't get ally tanks until after rescueing the first qeenlord),and gain Power Ups which provide you're tank with sheilds,replacement armor(if you're tank gets damaged),weapons,and ammo. The capaign mode is really fun and has good replay value(considering you can get more tanks if you get more points than you did lst time),but it's still good to do multiplayer modes with freinds for both practice(to prepair for campaign mode) and fresh challenges(if you've beat campaign mode more than once). Plus campaign mode includes bonus rounds where you can earn extra points. Okay here's a list of all the multiplayer modes:Deathmatch:You must be on you're own against other players for this one,but you can get automatick gun terrets to assist you.Annilation:Depending on the gang you choose,you get a certain number of Goliaths,minature tanks(similar in size to gun terrets,and of course,M1A1's. Battlord:Simply steal enemy queenlords. Strategy is greatly involved as they're are 3+ ways to get past a enemy Goliath tank(fire guided missiles from your own base,move in and out fast with a moto tank,head on attack,lay mines on its track,or place a neough gun buddies to take it down. Defense measures include protecting your goliath tank,laying mine around your base,switching to goliath tank,or placing gun buddies.",5,Awesome game!,1008028800,"12 11, 2001",-0.038
