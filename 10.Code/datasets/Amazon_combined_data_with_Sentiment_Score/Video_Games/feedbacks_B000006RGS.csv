Then at least beat the game before doing so. >_>",5,Brings back memories.,1251849600,"09 2, 2009",0.2946
1,A14NLQE68Z29I,B000006RGS,B. Convery,"[0, 0]","If I could have give 6 stars for this game, I would have. I played this originally when it first came out in 1996. Back then, games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were ground-breaking milestones in entertainment known as video games. I won't talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that.Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true 3D environment. Sure, you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien, but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis. Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara, the feminine version of Indiana Jones, an use the environments such as cliffs, roofs, etc. to progress through the levels. Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around. Beautiful, stunning, breath-taking, eerie, surreal, all describe the level design here. Nothing short of ingenious.The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best, but they were also adequate to get the job done. Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right, and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing. Turning can sometimes be a chore, especially when the action is turned up a notch. Luckily, the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble, for a quick &quot;about-face&quot;. The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing. Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges, and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed (NOTE: This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors, including Angel of Darkness for PS2. This kind of action became less and less as the series went on, save for Last Revelation, maybe). The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well.There are plenty of surprises in this game that I don't want to give away, however, I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long, long time after. For example, &quot;The God Room&quot; of St. Francis' Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that I've played.So why am I writing this review now, 7 years after the release date? For a few reasons. First, being that I can't get the game out of my head for more than a few months. Every six months I go back to it. The second reason, is that when I bought a PS2, I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability. And THIRD and quite possibly the most important (and the reason I titled this review &quot;Dear Eidos&quot;) is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS2 for an X-Box. At first I enjoyed AOD, but the game has rampant problems. I've always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance. I loved all the other PS1 Tomb Raider games, including III, which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind, but whatever. I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that. And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week. I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day. Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it. Sure the graphics feel older, but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo, Crimson Skies, Prince of Persia, and Rainbow Six 3 on the X-Box. There will always be a large place in my geeky video-gaming heart for this true classic.EIDOS: TAKE THE POWER BACK!",5,"Dear Eidos,",1074124800,"01 15, 2004",0.2246

Lara's Madonna-style pyramid breasts) and jerky low frame rate - BUT WHO CARES. Tomb Raider was one of the first fully-realized 3D games, with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully - something next-gen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes - and, of course, best of all, an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with. Yes, Lara Croft - men want her, women want to be her...lol. Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and (worst of all) the PS2 platform. Even on the PS1, all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldn't improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut. The puzzles, the secrets, the at-times relentless action, this game has it all.Much like Indiana Jones, we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America - allegedly the village of Vilcabamba, an actual archeological site in Ecuador, although as it appears in the game it's more of a generic hotch-pot of pre-Columbian art and architecture. Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere, and of course she eventually finds a golden idol - more nods to Indy. Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt, slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet (PETA just loved this game) before proceeding to - where else? - Atlantis, which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants. All this because she's in search of an artifact whose magical powers, if in the wrong hands, could destroy the world, or something.It's easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot, but that doesn't affect the entertainment value - again just like with Indy, you know it's stupid, but you're more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride. Getting through the levels is not always easy; you'll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzle-solving skills. There's also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolically-hidden secrets, which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous medi-paks.Play this game - it's almost like a cool retro thing to do now - and forget about everything that came after. They have a new TR in the works now but it's got a lot of bad karma to overcome...so far nothing has matched this original masterpiece.",5,The ORIGINAL derivative Indiana Jones ripoff,1100563200,"11 16, 2004",0.0533
3,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B000006RGS,Busy Body,"[3, 3]","So, this is where it all began - the original Tomb Raider. In November 1996, Britain was changing. With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase girl power, there wasn't a better time to bring out an all-female computer game heroine who kicked [rear]! Enter Lara Croft. The game went straight to No.1 all over the world and shifted more than 10 million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time. Lara soon became a cultural icon, gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over - and not just computer magazines, mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time; undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world. Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II, Tomb Raider III, Tomb Raider IV: The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV: Chronicles. The five games have sold a combined total of 40 million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly, Lara Croft and Tomb Raider, a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest, most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time.The story of Tomb Raider is simple really. Lara Croft is a semi-famous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman, Natla (last name unknown) to search the globe for an ancient artifact, known as the Scion, that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis. Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it, she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize. Around halfway through the game, while uncovering clues about the artifact in question, Lara also unveils the truth about Natla; a story told through amazing cut-scenes. The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more, yet never for the game to end.The game begins with simple, pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls. The enemies are only small in the first few levels; bats, dogs etc. that can be eliminated with a single shot of Lara's Pistols - a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo. The game has a massive 16 levels that will keep you playing for months - it took me 10 months to complete. In fact, I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once I'd finished with the first, I spent the next 10 months playing the second one! This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around 6 years without a break! I remember the days when I bought this game...I was only 10 and it scared me to death! The enemies may not look very real, but remember that controlling Lara is! You control her every move so her life is in your hands! At the time the game was released, the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking. The former is not so much now, but the latter still stands. Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since 1996, but half an hours' play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft, and its superior excellence shines through. The final levels are set in and around Atlantis, and are classic moments in video gaming history. From the rocky cliffs of Asia, to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis, there's something here for everyone. Buy it now!OVERALL GRADE: 10/10All in all, Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game. Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable. The atmosphere, the sounds the animals make, the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock, the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen - everything! This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved 6 years ago. If you haven't got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection, it is not complete. Only when you purchase all 5 Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete. With the soon-to-be released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI: The Angel Of Darkness, all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades, literally. I will still be playing Tomb Raider when I'm 60 years old, and I'm sure I'll not be the only one...",5,Tomb Raider is a classic - Lara Croft is an icon!,1031011200,"09 3, 2002",0.1526

5,A28R83ADQPMF2X,B000006RGS,Chris W.,"[4, 4]","From the ruins of Rome to the futuristic setting of Atlantis, Tomb Raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds. Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings. I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic. However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it.The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat. The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable. However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles. Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect.I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer. However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities. Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility. If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game. However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.",4,An Outstanding Game Certainly to Become a Classic,1023667200,"06 10, 2002",0.453

Well placed and thought provoking puzzles. Some nice action, great graphics which still hold up today, and lots of fun. The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending, and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least 60 times in order to kill him.

7,A1FD8LITJZE48V,B000006RGS,Frank Ponce Movie Mavin,"[1, 2]","God, it was ages ago when I last played the original &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. The first time I played it, maybe six years ago, I was amazed and frightened. I was frightened because of the very first level. You know, the awry music, dark caves, and vicious bats, wolves and bears. That will always be my first memory of playing &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;. Even though it's dated now, it still lives up to its name despite several sequels and dissapointing movies.What really made this game famous, and made Playstaion fun, was the goddess Lara Croft. She's absolutely gorgeous! You play the adventrous archaeologist in a quest to recover an ancient artifact; Croft travels the world in style, from Peru to Egypt and to the lost city of Atlantis.I think that's the story for the game. I lost track since I haven't played this game for awhile. But what was original about this game wasn't really Lara's beauty, it was the gameplay. The gamer has to solve complexed puzzles, battle hard enemies(including dinosaurs!) and go through hidden rooms and collect treasures from ancient cities.There is also a good amount of weapons for Lara, including her trademark dual pistols. There is also some health packs in case she gets hurt, in fact she gets hurt alot! No human being could ever do the things she does! The very physical Lara jumps impossible feats, does handstands and survives in very dangerous situations. She's a female Indiana Jones!Anyway, &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; is an entertaining game. It has good graphics, solid gameplay, and Lara Croft is hot! But the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series has lost track of its self. The gameplay is all ready becoming old, and its lack of innovation hasn't made gamers happy. Including myself. Only part 2 is the best sequel.

8,A1HJ2ADX8TH5F6,B000006RGS,G. Hollis,"[5, 13]","I'm going to fly in the face of convention wisdom and assert that Tomb Raider is not a good game. I like the concept, the puzzle solving and exploration. I like that it's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up. The problem is with the tedious game play. The game is tough, just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you're supposed to be doing in each level. But that's part of the fun, figuring things out. Unfortunately, it's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic. There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error. In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point, or in some cases you die, meaning you have to start the whole level over again. And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over, you finally get frustrated and give up. There were instances where I tried a jump over and over, and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts. For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace. It's too bad, I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me. I know it's one of PSX &quot;greatest hits&quot; and very popular, but if don't like tedious games, you'll want to avoid this one.",2,"Concept is good, but tedious game play really spoils the fun",999043200,"08 29, 2001",-0.159

It would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old times...What I disliked: I beat Mexico levels playing each one two to six hours. I got to St Francis' Folly level.Things started to look really tiresome: first, I spent too much energy beating pillar sub-level and didn't have spare medpack reaching ground floor. I restarted. I got enough energy by reaching ground but wasn't able to beat pool puzzle on top. Then I figured out that I should have gone to the ground WITHOUT USING SAVE CRYSTALS, open all puzzle doors (top level door is connected to ground switch) and then climb back up...which means another level restart.Maybe this game is for hardcore fans, but I am not one of them...I got frustrated enough to quit.",3,Unbalanced difficulty of levels,1247184000,"07 10, 2009",0.2345

My favorite is where she is facing a Sphinx- like statue- now that was a fun level.Tomb Raider is one of the greatest storylines ever created and that is why it is so popular even nowadays.

19,A3OZ8IB8I0VSO1,B000006RGS,Solid Pawn,"[0, 0]","The original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series. It holds up well, but is a definite acquired taste.Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion, an ancient talisman of great power. However, after finding the piece, Lara is betrayed by Jacqueline's men. Now it's a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power. Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game, and unfortunately the graphics haven't aged very well. Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey. Despite this the game's length is impressive. There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs, giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game. Lara moves in a very stiff fashion. Her controls are tank-like and You have to hold down a button for her to walk. She takes very long jumps, but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases. Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home. The game is primarily a puzzle platformer. Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills.Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress. This is where combat comes into play. Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo. Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms, however these weapons do have limited ammo, but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle.The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game. The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted. The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury. You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow. Unfortunately, once a crystal is used it is gone. This makes it really difficult when you've got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health. Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save.This game has many flaws, but it is a very rewarding experience. I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge. The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here. If you're curious about the beginning of the franchise you won't be disappointed, but maybe a little stressed.For classic PC gamers I'd recommend Tomb Raider: Unfinished Business.
