2,A21XZF5ZHKK5EM,B00000DMAR,Antoinette Johnson Pooky,"[2, 2]","First off I've only owned two Crash Games. The first Crash Bandicoot and Wrath of Cortex for the PS1. I played a demo for Warped on my Spyro the dragon game and wanted it ever since. I bought it on Amazon and its safe for me to say that...THIS IS THE CRASH I KNOW AND LOVE!^_^For those who don't know Crash Bandicoot first came out in the 90's as a standard, straight-forward platformer. You're a mutated Bandicoot named Crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist Dr.Neo Cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend. In Warped Dr. Cortex now works for Uka Uka (The brother of Aku Aku) an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world. He instructs Cortex to go through time and collect Crystals and Gems that hold extreme power. Crash has to literally race through time and jump, spin, and dance his way through time to retrieve them before Cortex gets ahold of them.This game is just as fun as the first one. It brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on. The controls are spot on. You can build momentum for jumps, move in any direction, and really I never had problems with the controls even in the first Crash. One thing I REALLY love about this one is that I don't feel bad when I die! This game has some really interesting death scenes rather you're forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince, eaten by lions, thrown into the screen by a two-headed fat person, or so on. When I finish the game I plan on seeing how many ways I can die:) Some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through. The boss battles are really diverse and take strategy, timing, and skill to get rid of. I must confess I found the first boss and 2 worlds extremely easy. Its not until the 3 that the game just goes F*** this! I'm gonna make your time a living hell! Its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what I said above. I also noticed something that first caught my attention in Wrath of Cortex. The game seems extremely open when it comes to lives. Seriously I'm not even half way through the game and all ready up to 50 almost. I guess I'm that good at playing. Im definately buying the second one.I admit I'm disappointed at the way the turn the series have made. I wish they kept it as a patformer and just added maybe some adventure elelments to it like they did Twinsanity (even though its glitchy as hell). Naughty Dog where did you go? Crash Bandicoot Warped is just what I expected it to be. Its funny, addicting, challenging and overall just shows graphics don't make the game, but its content and gameplay.",5,Who says retro games aren't fun?,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",-0.0294

In this game, there are 30 different levels that are mostly composed of the same 3D Crash levels that we're used to. Some levels, however, you get to use a biplane, motorcycle, or Jet Ski. Like the previous versions of Crash, you have to collect crystals and gems. Now, you can also collect a relic for having the best time.

4,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000DMAR,B. E Jackson,"[7, 7]","I am shocked and *very* pleased to report that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is a DRASTIC improvement over the original Crash Bandicoot.As you may have heard, I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in 1996. I am, however, incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly never-ending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 1998.Just so you know, I can't compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back because I haven't played that one. I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot.Before playing Crash 3, I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game. I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim rip-off, and didn't deserve all the attention it got.For 10 years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew, and truth be told, it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring, repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage.Simply put, Crash's very first outing was BORING. It desperately needed variety. Walking through island/jungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring. The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite- Warped features nothing BUT creativity. In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel. You will encounter something drastically different in every stage. I like that.The main objective of Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the 25 stages of the game. You HAVE to find all 25 purple gems otherwise the game won't allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world you're in. For example, if you're in World 4, and can't find the purple gem in stage 3, you won't be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world. You're stuck there until you find that darn purple gem. Once you find the gem, and face and defeat the boss, you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss. By the way, there's 5 worlds total and 5 stages in each world. That comes to 25 stages total.The amount of creativity that went into each of the 25 stages is simply incredible. Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground, Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety. In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages (where you're required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem), a couple underwater stages (with VERY neat-looking backgrounds and deadly, puffy fish swimming about), a couple levels where you're steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes, and not to mention those tricky, tiger-riding stages.Oh, and I HAVE to mention the ultra-cool futuristic robot stages (which require near-perfect jumping patterns in order to complete). The Jet Ski stages are really fun because you're located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs. Yup, it's awesome. This is what makes Crash Bandicoot 3 so great- you won't know WHAT to expect until you enter the level.Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge. That's not to say the game is a cakewalk, either. People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games. If you compare Warped to say, I don't know, Spyro the Dragon, it's not such an easy game then. It's definitely not a hard game either. You WILL beat it. I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros. 1, the old NES classic.The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World 3 where you're required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction. This is one case where practice doesn't necessarily make perfect. Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you don't bother shooting down the enemy planes.One thing about Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems. Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems, because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage. I mean, they are always RIGHT THERE. RIGHT in front of you!After you complete a stage, you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time. Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard. It means you *really* have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spin-attack an enemy or ANYTHING. It means you have to run run RUN! Just so you know, completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement. It's entirely up to you if you'd like to accept the challenge. I'm too much of a wimp to accept it, personally.I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage. You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room, if you wish. Very convenient. Oh, and get this- if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation, when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there! I can't think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect. Speaking of lives, they are *so easy* to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to 45 of them. That's a lot, and you will probably need them because, even though the challenge ranges from low to medium, your first time through the game won't be THAT simple.When Crash gets hit or smashed by something, I think it's funny the way he yells whoa! It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top.The reason Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped isn't going to receive a 5-star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon- in the flying stages (in this case, the airplane stages) when you hit down on the D-pad the airplane flies UP, and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN. The game company made the direction the wrong way! Oops. At least when you steer the airplane left, it will go left. The same with right. Unfortunately, many game makers have made, and continue to make, the same mistake. It needs to be corrected once and for all.I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit down on the d-pad is an example of realism since that's more or less how REAL airplanes operate, but the thing is, Crash Bandicoot isn't supposed to be about realism since it's just a platform adventure game, and furthermore, it still doesn't change the fact that up and down are reversed. This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards.There's a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country 3 where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge, and in my mind at least, having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge.I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun time.",4,Crash's best game,1156118400,"08 21, 2006",0.0266

12,ANS7PVYBOXVGO,B00000DMAR,JackLiberty Steven Smith Jr.,"[0, 0]","Well let&#8217;s end the Crash Bandicoot trilogy on PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. This game was released in 1998 and was once again, developed by Naughty Dog, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios. It was originally a PlayStation exclusive but was later re-released as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store.The game&#8217;s story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the Cortex Vortex come crashing down to Earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as Uka Uka who is Aku Aku&#8217;s evil twin brother; Aku Aku is the mask that helped Crash out in the first two games. Uka Uka joins with Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nefarious Tropy as they plan to gather Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth.The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game. You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game. You travel back and forward in time to gather the 25 Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does; but don&#8217;t worry, the levels are completely different from each the second game. The game takes place in the Time-Twisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game. The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start. Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels. The goal is the same as the second game; obtain the crystal hidden in the area. Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race. The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes, or completing a hidden level or task. Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber, a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back. By defeating the boss, the next chamber will become available to play. By defeating a boss you unlock a new power, there&#8217;s the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful, the double jump, a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period, a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint.The newest main feature in the game is the &#8220;Relics&#8221; which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game. After you obtain a level&#8217;s crystal, you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail. The goal is to reach the end as fast as you can, but there are some differences: There are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time, there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die, you have to start the level from the beginning; but there are plenty of Aku Aku masks to help you and that&#8217;s pretty much it. It proves to be very challenging and getting the Platinum relics is insanely difficult and even I never managed to get all of them.This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall, period. I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for $6, this is a MUST PLAY.

They're thin and pink. Touch them and you've obtained them. Just beat the level to earn one after you pick them up. One per normal level.Gems: To get these, break all the boxes in the level.

They serve as platforms to new areas in some levels. To get them, ride on a platform in some levels (for the platform to appear, you have to not have died up to that platform.) One in a level every 5 levels.Relics: A new addition. After you get the relic in the level, go back and get the relic by going as fast as you can through the level and getting a certain time.

18,A2W6SI073FIRMA,B00000DMAR,KlownArt,"[1, 2]","Crash Bandicoot WarpedI have always loved the Crash Bandicoot Series. The original three on the Playstation were good, and the ones that would follow were always decent. I went back to play this classic and discovered it was just as great as I remembered. Still, it does have its low points.Graphics- 8/10On the original Playstation, these graphics were fairly good. The characters look blocky at points, but it sort of adds to the appeal. Voice syncing is pretty well done. Levels and characters are interestingly designed. The fact that most levels have another level that looks similar doesn't really bother me. They change the levels up enough to where it feels like you are playing a different level.Story- 3/10This is the part of the game that is a huge letdown. Neo Cortex, our antagonist, starts the game off exactly like he was left on the second game...falling from the sky. After failing to stop Crash Bandicoot from capturing all of the powerful Crystals, he plummets from his exploding spaceship and falls into a mountain. Inside of the mountain just so happens to be Uka Uka, a powerful witch mask that appears to have been giving Cortex orders all along. Uka Uka was trapped in the mountain by Aku Aku to keep the world safe. Now Uka Uka has escaped with Cortex. Uka Uka quickly recruits Dr. N. Trophy to build him a time machine so he can find the Crystals before Crash Bandicoot was even around.This honestly doesn't sound too bad. Until you see Crash and his friends at home. Aku Aku hears Uka Uka's evil laugh and senses danger. Then you suddenly appear at the time machine that Cortex is using and now you are using it. What happened to Cortex? I have no idea. How did you find your way there? Who knows? From there you use the time machine to get to the Crystals before Cortex.Sound- 8/10I love the music in this game. Every level type has different music, and it works for every level. If you are in an underwater level, you will hear mysterious sounding music. They just did the music very well. The voice acting is top notch as well. Sound effects are the same old Crash Bandicoot sounds though. It's not the best video game sound, but it's still really good.Gameplay- 9/10Gameplay can make or break a game. Luckily the Gameplay made this game. They added more variety than any of the previous games in the series.Crash Bandicoot is basically a side-scroller except the camera is behind Crash instead on the side. You are still on a fixed path that you have to follow. Sometimes you will even enter a part of the stage that is a side-scroller. The gameplay has always work very well like this.Warped is the third game in the series though, and they needed to add something new. They did just that by adding: Power Ups, Flying levels, underwater levels, jet-ski levels, and motorcycle racing levels. Power ups are gained whenever you defeat a boss. You get small things like double jump and belly flop at first. Later on you'll get a Laser Guided Bazooka and Running Shoes, which really change up the gameplay. One thing that I am happy about is that the Power Ups actually help you play the game. They aren't just useless add-onsThe new level types are just what this game series needed. The underwater levels play like a side-scroller underwater. It's enjoyable to swim around instead of walking. Jet Ski and Motorcycle levels are great vehicle levels. I admit that the controls on the Motorcycle levels take some getting used to, but that is what makes it fun. The flying levels are probably the coolest new things. There are only three in the entire game. You fly around in a plane and shoot down opposing planes. There isn't much to it, but it's a nice break from the other levels.Difficulty- 5/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)This game is extremely easy. You can go through the entire game without dying. Not just that, but the entire game only consists of around 3-4 hours of your time. One strong afternoon of playing, and you'll be done. The bosses on this game can become a little difficult, but it only takes a few minutes to learn their pattern. Also, I felt the final boss battle was too easy.Overall- 7/10The gameplay is extremely strong. The story for this game is just all out of whack. If you are looking for a quick game to pick up and play, this is for you. I suggest checking out the previous two titles first though. They areCrash BandicootandCrash Bandicoot 2. They are better games in my opinion.",3,"Great Gameplay, Whack Story",1216684800,"07 22, 2008",0.1712

In Crash 1 you get Balders after you sometimes, in Crash 3 you get a dinosaur, I prefered being chased by a balder and when it squashed Crash it went into the screen but you don't get it in this.BUY this if you want a platformer(after Crash 1 and 2).",5,It's not as good as Crash 1 or 2(in my opinion),1083715200,"05 5, 2004",-0.2561

Out of the Crash seires I think this one is the best. There are alot of thing you can do and the bosses rock. The story line is the best in this game. It takes plase after Crash2 were Dr.Cortex ship falles down on a temple, wich releses a demon mask. The mask that pertected crash in the first two games stats talking and tells crash that the evil mask is his Brother and his plan to build a time machine to get crystles todestroy earth.

What you have to do is collect the colored gem and the crystal. Guess what. It's not as easy as it sounds. This game pits you against tons of different enemies appropriate to the level. The only thing that takes a star away from this game is the fact that level ideas are repeated. For example there are two different water levels with not much difference.

Then out came this one, Crash Warped. This is the cult classic of the series. I have beaten the entire game, and never once been disappointed because of too much or too little challenge. I even managed to get a 104% file with the help of my brother and a twerp i know. There are two secret levels. They are Eggipus Rex and Hot Coco. To get to Eggipus Rex, you go into time trails in the Dino Might! level. Then, board the yellow gem platform. Keep running until you find the second pterydactyl (the triceratops will be already chasing you) and let it take you away. To get into the Hot Coco level, simply crash into the road sign with an alien on it in the Road Crash level. This game is a classic and every PS One or PS2 owner needs to have it.

I wouldn't want to give the story away, but let me tell you: The original two are no match for this great game! This game has 30 new colorful and nice levels, and 2 hidden ones. Almost all of them have nice and pretty graphics. There are more features too. For one thing, there is the Time Trial mode, in which you go through the levels in a certain amount of time, and you will get relics. You can play as Coco, riding her adorable tiger Pura, a jetski, a blimp, and a couple more. Crash himself can do some more things, like a Super Belly Flop, a Double Jump, a Triple Spin, use Speed Shoes and use a Fruit Bazooka for long range attacks. Also, he can ride an airplane, a motorcycle, a baby T-Rex and more. Also, even dying is humorous. Now for the game's one flaw: It is hard to be challenged. However, there are 3 types of relics. If you get all of the Sapphire Relics, you can get a really good ending. If you get all the Gold Relics, you get 105%. But the Platinum Relics require a master to collect.

You're a bandicoot and jump on / spin baddies you encounter. This game is kind of like old Mario games, but has awesome graphics. They've added a type of box to the prequel and give one move, such as bazooka or tornado death spin, for each boss. The game is easy to beat, but offers extras for breaking all the boxes or beating a level quickly. It's extremely difficult to collect all of them.
