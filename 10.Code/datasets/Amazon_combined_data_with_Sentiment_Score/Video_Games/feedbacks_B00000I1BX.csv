The best of the lot is the translation of Ms Pac-Man - very faithful to the original. Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original. Most people don't give Dig-Dug the credit it's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults. I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades, and this is a good rendition. On the other hand, &quot;Phozon&quot; and &quot;Tower of Druga&quot; are very forgettable, &quot;Tower&quot; the most worthless of the lot. Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac Man.",4,Even Better than Namco 1!,995414400,"07 18, 2001",0.6001

You get Ms. Pac-Man, Dig-Dug, Galaxian, Phozon, and The Tower of Duraga. Dig-Dug is my favorite out of these and all are fun, but some can get a little boring after a while. The graphics for the psone look great and little to no lag. I really like the theater and the library that is in it too! Overall, I really enjoyed this game and great for people who love arcade games! Can't wait to get the other Volumes some time.",5,Great collection of Namco games!,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",0.4293

However, at 7 games, it is STILL the best value of the series. I now return you to your regularly scheduled game review, already in progress..)These games are of course perfectly emulated and a joy to play alone or with family.One thing I neglected to mention about the Pole Position titles in this volume and the first:If you play these games with the obscure Namco Playstation controller called the &#34;NEGcon&#34; You will have the ABSOLUTE BEST controls of the game, outside of maybe the arcade cabinets themselves.

Now today its even hotter then ever. New generations as well as old are at it again going Pac-wild with The whole Pac-Family games. I will never get tired of Pac-Man and Mrs. Pac-Man, and they are still hard and challenging as hell!I remember playing Dig Dug on an old computer in my Support home work class back in Junior High in NYC, and today its still a collectors and a classic.A must buy Gem to keep forever for those who love these games and want to play them on the PSX. The playstation controller is great with PAC-MAN games as well as other games from all the namco Museum collection.Thanks for reading",5,"Without MRS PAC-MAN and DIG DUG, this collection would suck!",1170633600,"02 5, 2007",0.5379

What u can do is walk around the museum and look at all of the game rooms or just explore and see what is there. Each room that u walk in that is a game has a really cool movie clip before u play them. There is this one room that tells u all of the info about games and when they came out and how popular they were. Which is awsome to learn about it. The graphics in the museum r great for the ps1 but when u play the arcade games they got changed from the original by a tiny bit and the music is more clear. It has many of the classics that u can play single or multiplayer on which is fun. When u get this game dont think all there is is the arcade games in it, there is much more than that. It is an awsome game.",5,Great classics!!!,1247097600,"07 9, 2009",0.3109

When I bought VOl 3 (just for Mrs. Pac-man)it was like WOW I forgot about pole position (ya nothing like nascar 2002), but that use to be my favorite when I was a kid & still is!! Funny thing is when I was 8yrs old I could never get past the 2nd screen in Galaxian Now 22 years later of playing video games, I still can't get past the 2nd screen even though I master Sypro (a 2000 game) in 2 days.I have to admit druaga & phozon were never favorites when I was kid but there hoot to play now just seeing those out of date graphics, yep the graphic may be pathetic & game idea may seem simple but they are still challenging and a good reminder of what the good old days of video games were like.",4,the good old days,1061942400,"08 27, 2003",0.8885
8,AO4J90YPX5RU6,B00000I1BX,Moviebuffer101,"[0, 1]","Namco Volume 3 is a well rounded collection of classic arcade favorites. It features Ms. Pacman, DigDug, Galaxian (which became addictive very fast after a few plays.), also..features Pole Position II, Phozen (which I had never heard of till this collection. It's not for everyone.), and last but not least we have..The Tower of Druaga. Obviously the best games are Ms. Pacman, Galaxian, and DigDug which each of these games are worth having individually, so having them all on one disc it's hard to go wrong. But wait there is one slight problem. When you go to the screen that allows you to change the dip switches..when they pop up they cover the menu and you don't know what your changing until you get back to the game, only to realize you have unknowingly changed your amount of lives to 1 and set your bonus on 10000000 or something to that effect. Maybe it's just me but I would have preferred a modern menu instead of the switches. Never~the~less 4 STARS.",4,Classic Arcade Games,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",0.1295
9,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00000I1BX,tvtv3 tvtv3,"[4, 4]","This collection of games from Namco is a blast from the past for anyone who grew up playing video games at home on Atari or who spent their entire life savings at the arcades. The games included on this collection are: Ms. Pac Man, Dig Dug, Galaxion, Phozon, Pole Position II, and Tower Of Druaga. For those who don't own a PS2, NAMCO MUSEUM VOL. 3 is worth owning because of Ms. Pac Man, Dig Dug, and Galaxion.Ms. Pac Man is just as fun to play as the original Pac Man but is just slightly more difficult and gives a more continues the story begun in Pac Man.Dig Dug is one of the classic arcade games of the 80s. The game seems easy enough to play (dig your way through dirt, kill monsters before they kill you, and collect vegetables). However, the game becomes increasingly difficult as you progress and before you know it your running away more than you are shooting at monsters because there's just too many of them.Galaxion is another arcade classic. It takes the premise of Space Invaders one step further so that instead of defending a planetary base from destruction and invasion, you're in space trying to destroy an enemy fleet before they blow you up. In Space Invaders you could hide your gun behind turrets, but there is no place to hide in Galaxion.The other three games on the collection are fairly forgettable and were somewhat obscure in the day. Phozon is a type of puzzle game where you try to match up the phozons with the pattern without getting blown to bits. Pole Position II is a racing game where you blow up if you get too far off course or run into items. In that sense its realistic. However, the game is extremely difficult to play because the analog component of the paddle isn't compatible and you don't have a joystick so you're forced to drive your car using the directional buttons. What a pain. Tower of Druaga is the final game on the collection. It involves trying to get Gil to climb through all the levels of the Tower. It's kind of like an early video game version of role playing. It's kind of interesting, but it takes an incredibly long amount of time to defeat.Overall, this is a great collection for anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s. For those who are too young to remember Atari, the game is nice to play because of its retro and anything retro is cool.",5,You Know You Grew Up In the 1980s If . . .,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",-0.043
