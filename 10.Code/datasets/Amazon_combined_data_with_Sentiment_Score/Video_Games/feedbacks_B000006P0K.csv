If you're a beginner, start of with someone with fast kicks like marchial Law and not Jack 2. BUY THIS because it's an ABSOLUTE CLASSIC.",5,An absolute classic,1083801600,"05 6, 2004",0.2906

People keep on saying, Tekken 2 has HORRIBLE graphics and the gameplay is horrible!, To those people, did you ever think that this game came out during the 90's and was probably awesome graphics back then? If you're a fan of good fighting games, I reccomend this. It has lots of characters, fair graphics, and is a good collectible for your Tekken collection.",5,Tekken 2 Or Bust,1215388800,"07 7, 2008",0.0465

I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun. Though the graphics aren't as top notch at games these days are, but it's still an entertaining game to play. If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games, this is a must own. This sequal is too good to miss out on. Buy it before it's gone for good.",5,A great sequal to the first.,1277942400,"07 1, 2010",0.445

LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR, HAS GREAT GRAPHICS, GREAT LOOKING MOVES, AND GREAT BOSSES TO UNLOCK, WHICH GIVES YOU A REASON TO WANNA WIN THE GAME WITH EVERY CHARACTER. THE MUSIC IS GREAT HERE TOO.

8,A30WCCIVCXKZBF,B000006P0K,Pimpdawg,"[1, 1]","Though this review may be 14 years 2 late,n my opinion TK2 is the best of the PS1 Tekken games.From the cool fmv intro 2 the ending credits TK2 is by far the best looking/sounding 3D fighting game on the ps1 console.TK3 backgrounds,music,fmv cinemas,light source shading,animations/combos just does'nt measure 2 the standards set by this 1996 classic and it was release 2 years later,go figure!",5,BEST OF THE PS1 TEKKEN SERIES,1288828800,"11 4, 2010",0.8999
9,A261CI99KET69W,B000006P0K,Pow3rh0use,"[0, 0]","I remember Tekken 2 being one of my first fighting games I have ever played, and one that I kept coming back to. It wasn't just the nostalgia that kept me coming back, but the overall gameplay as well. Almost everything about this game was done right, and there is very little to complain about.Tekken 2 takes place 2 years after the events of the first Tekken. The plot isn't very well developed and isn't really involving, but everything else more than makes up for it. The graphics (for the time) were amazing and the animations were also nicely done. The roster includes 24 characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced. The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it. The controls are simple and intuitive, and I always believed that this control scheme (each button controls a limb-ex. left punch, right punch) is one of the best for fighting games.For modes, you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters. You also have a vs. mode, a team battle mode (which is very enjoyable), a survival mode, a time attack mode, and a practice mode. All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes.The combat system is still excellent to this day. The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed. There also aren't really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken (such as excessive juggling).Overall, this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played. With plenty of characters to learn, plenty of modes to choose from, amazing looking backgrounds, and a terriffic combat system, there is no reason to skip this game. If you still have a ps1/ps2, BUY THIS GAME. I recommend this game wholeheartedly, and you won't regret it at all.",5,One of the best fighting games of all time,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",0.2351

11,AHL3ES7DCWZJC,B000006P0K,TaRan,"[0, 0]","The sequel to the very popular Tekken, Tekken 2 takes everything that the original had and expands upon it. More characters, more levels, more moves, Tekken 2 is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover.The combat in Tekken is one of best ever. There are so many possible combinations, it's almost impossible to remember them all. Each Tekken gets better and better. Another thing I love about this game is the music.
