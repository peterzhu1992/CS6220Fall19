When playing I also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the Playstation platform. While the story is well-done, it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay. So I'll understand if Syphon Filter fans hate me because of this review, but seriously the gameplay is terrible.",2,"SORRY, BUT IT PLAYS TERRIBLE 4.75 OUT OF 10",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",-0.4374
1,ACGBAI00YLEBW,B00000IODY,A. Navarro,"[0, 5]","This is an early military simulation type game, and pretty much obsolete, basically a mediocre pastiche of other stuff being done at the time. The graphics are supposed to be photo realistic but they aren't, the ideal in these types of games is that it should look like a helmet cam worn by a soldier in real life. Everything looks very matter of fact... This isn't a beautiful game to behold. The psn version that I have glitches and freezes up often, I don't know if that was a problem in the original or not but it probably was. The Gabe Logan 3D model is the worst that I've seen in a ps1 game, he has a Sasquatch body with a Lego character face, and stands and walks like Sasha Mitchell. That has nothing to do with the limitations of the system but instead it's a limitation of the artistic ability of the people working on the game. Controls are pretty close to as bad as it gets, very hard to steer your character, mostly worthless auto-lock targeting. There is some creativity to the level design, some okay variety, but there was better stuff being made back then. I stopped playing a level or two after the helicopter boss, because the enemies start wearing super flak jackets that take more than one clip, it turns into a head hunting game where you have to go into manual targeting mode and are left a sitting duck unable to move from the sucky controls.",2,Sort of fun and unintentionally funny.,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",-0.1227
2,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000IODY,B. E Jackson,"[1, 19]","WAY too many positive reviews for such a crappy game. That's what I think. Syphon Filter is atrocious. I received this game as a Christmas present (gee, what a crappy gift) back in the late 90's. I thought to myself well, all the N64 players have Goldeneye, I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation! How wrong I was.It's not that the actual game is bad. I mean, walking around shooting people is fun, and it's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once (and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so). The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry.Without a certain special code it's REALLY hard to get *anywhere*. The storyline is similar to one you'd see in the TV show Jag. It's just not interesting to me. Walking around shooting people is fun, but that's all the game has going for it. Now imagine if that special code didn't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots. The difficulty would be out of this world.I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it. The Christmas I got the game, I had a few bad personal things happen. But looking back, Syphon Filter really isn't any good. It's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used, and only a couple dollars to buy brand new. It's not even worth THAT much!",2,just avoid it,1152403200,"07 9, 2006",-0.1675

4,A1ZYZ5853ZADZA,B00000IODY,Eric Johnson,"[6, 8]","Following the popularity of Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter is a game that stands up very well on its own. It has enough that is different that it can be considered a very good game in its own right. SF has a very nice blend of shoot-em-up and stealth missions that it is never the same thing over and over. However, it does find a few things lacking. The save system is horrendous. You can only save at points that are very far apart. The checkpoint system which allows you to restart at the last checkpoint helps this a little, but being able to save a checkpoints would have made this game much better. Also, some scenarios are very difficult, especially if you've been playing it through and miss one detail. Most likely, it's a detail that you will miss everytime, which can make a few missions very frustrating. The cut scenes are good and the game control is good. The wide variety of weapons is very interesting as well. All in all, this is a very good game marred by a very few flaws.",4,A great Metal Gear Solid clone,962668800,"07 4, 2000",0.2754

6,A23KDYA7YGPEWW,B00000IODY,Gil,"[5, 5]","During one of my many ventures to my local game store a year and a half ago, I came across a game called Syphon Filter. Intrigued, I went ahead and bought it, popped it in my Psone, and to this day, it is one of the best games I have ever played. I have beat the 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and am on my second pass through the series. I will then give the Omega Strain a go on my PS2 once I am finished with SF3. While I have read no so favorable reviews on OS, I think it would be fair to at least give it a try.You are Gabe Logan, a special operative for a super secret government orginization aptly named The Agency. Your mission is to find a dangerous chemical stolen by terrorists from a lab and stop them before they destroy the world. You are remotely partnered with Lian Xing, another agent who guides you through your missions and later on in the game is in action on the ground.You are gradually given an arsenal of weapons as each level moves forward. Among them are: There is the Silenced 9mm handgun, the .45 handgun, the G-18 Pistol-machine Gun, , the HK-5 Pistol Machine Gun, the Shotgun, the Combat Shotgun, the PK-102 Assault Rifle, the M-16 Assault Rifle, and the K3G4 Assault Rifle just to name a few.In each mission based level, you must accomplish a variety of objectives, and eliminate a tough boss at different intervals. You will use stealth at times, or just face enemies head on. The interesting part about this game is that it really draws you in, and takes some interesting twists and turns as it progresses.As for gameplay, it is fantastic and addicting. While the levels are challenging and tough at times, they are not overly frustrating or extremely hard. Some levels and missions are easy, and others will take a few times to get through. It will be a bit of a challenge if you play this for the first time, but you won't become overwhelmed as in similar games. As you play it a second and third time,though, you will become familiar with the layout of the levels and more or less breeze through. As an example, I was able to shoot down the chopper on the base tower after 5 tries, as opposed to 30 attempts during my first run through the game over a year ago. You will also attain some tricks along the way as well, such as becoming more effective at headshots and so on. I have found that it's the little things that get you through this game.As for game layout and graphics, excellent, IMO for 1999 PS1. Great voice animations and camera angles as well.While there are many new games out, especially in the wake of the XBOX 360 and PSP releases, I still encourage you to give this masterpiece a try. You won't be disappointed.",5,"Awesome, addicting",1134432000,"12 13, 2005",0.1311

People have to remember that this was one of the early 3d games that tried to incorporate stealth elements, so it is not as smooth as some of today's games, but it is still pretty well done in my opinion. The game has its flaws, but was a very fun game and the difficulty was just right. Not too easy and the boss fights were pretty sweet and did require multiple attempts on my part.

12,A2QHS1ZCIQOL7E,B00000IODY,Richard Baker BinaryMessiah,"[1, 1]","The Good: A lot of excelent guns, decent story with memorable characters, genius level design, tight controls and camera, varied objectives and localesThe Bad: Flimsy stealth, some levels are confusing, a little shortThird person shooters weren't very frequent on PS1 and when they did come by they were usually pretty bad. Syphon Filter proved that you can make this genre work on the PS1. The game is still really fun today and was way ahead of its time. A well done camera, great lock-on system, a decent story with memorable characters, a kick-ass arsenal of guns, and genius level design. Who would have thought a third person shooter would be this good in the late 90&#8242;s? Eidetic and 989 Studios did.You play as super spy Gabriel Logan who is a CIA agent trying to stop a dangerous terrorist named Eric Rhoemer. A Syphon Filter virus that targets specific DNA demographics has been created by a man named Phagan and it is up to you to shut down their operations and stop them from spreading the virus. You start out in New York with the streets being shot up by Rhoemer's thugs. There are objectives in each level to complete, but it is way beyond throw this switch, pull this lever, or shoot this amount of bad guys. You usually have to kill a certain amount of scientists, administer vaccines to victims, disarm bombs, turn off power grids. The objectives vary, but what is fun is figuring out how to get there.Syphon Filter has some of the most memorable levels I can remember. This is a game you play several times and remember where every enemy is, every crate location, and even how to kill each enemy. The levels vary with stealth sections, climbing, and timed areas. The game features a smart lock-on system because there is no camera control. It is surprisingly smart and follows you wherever you go. Enemies wearing flak jackets can only be taken out with head shots or very powerful weapons. This requires aiming in first person mode and taking them out. This flak jacket element is a staple of the series and will go on to be in every game. It is actually an element all on its own and not just body armor for you or the enemy. You can die very easily and if you don't stop and aim for head shots you will waste ammo and/or die very quickly.There are a couple of boss fights thrown in such as a helicopter midway and Rhoemer himself at the end. I found all gameplay elements to be evenly tossed up so you are never bored. The stealth elements need a bit of work and are probably the worst thing about the game, but it is very minor. Crouching and sneaking around works fine, but enemies tend to see you at unknown distances. Maybe a line of sight cone on the radar would help this. You also have to get in head shots otherwise they won't die right away and alert other guards.Weapon selection is also a bit flimsy because you have to hold down select and use L2 and R2 (strafe buttons) to select the weapon. I would have preferred a radial menu instead. Some levels can be a bit hard to navigate are too dark to see. Thankfully you get a flashlight you can equip because some levels are nearly pitch black. I found myself lost a few times because even though the level design is fantastic, some levels can look the same with confusing hallways and misplaced crates and boxes.I actually learned about weapons as a kid from this game. Real world weapons are in here and some that I have never seen in any other game before. The weapons are almost a character all on their own because they feel so good to shoot in the game. The K3G4 will cut through flak jackets easily and is probably the only weapon that will do this. The G18 is a super fast sub-machine pistol, while the silenced 9mm is a staple of the series. The shotgun, combat shotgun, PK-102, BIZ-2, Nightvision Rifle, .45, HK5, and a few more are all excellent weapons. It was also the distinct sounds the developers used that make these guns so memorable. The game has a great sniper scope that was unseen in games back then. There are grenades and gas grenades which are great for taking out a group of enemies stealthily. There are a lot of great weapons in the game and they are very memorable unlike most shooters.While the game itself is amazing the graphics were pretty good at the time. Looking pretty realistic art wise, the game had some good lighting effects and a lot of detail everywhere. I also have many fond memories of this game as a kid. I actually accidentally rented Silent Hill because I forgot the name of this game. I got all the way to the Pharcom Warehouse levels and had to turn the game in. I rented this game many times over and played it to death as a kid. I purchased it a few times here and there and every time I play this it brings back fond memories. Syphon Filter is one of the greatest games ever made and every gamer should play this masterpiece.",5,One of the best series of all time,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",0.0288
13,A1FZI1F22GRO4C,B00000IODY,Richard Veysey,"[1, 5]","I went in to Syphon Filter with high hopes and was somewhat dissapointed. While the levels are large and fairly well designed, the quite average graphics caused problems when you get close to surfaces. The games controls also suffer from problems, mostly in terms of the targeting function, which is useful for quick aiming in tight spaces, or when an enemy is moving fast, yet will often aim for enemies you can't hit, when you are being shot at by ones you can, or even aim behind you, throwing the camera into wild spinning and throwing your character out of control. Fortunately auto-aiming removes the necessity of using targeting in most circumstances. In some places, infinately respawning enemies will cause a great deal of frustration (just to be fair, I did set off an alarm, but still...). Some puzzles are good without being [dumb] and contrived, but some were just plain stupid, especially one early in the game where some explosives you just happen to need are hidden in a box in a dark corner of the level. Some triggered events (especially spawning) are odd, for example, on one level, if you haven't completed a certain objective, you will die without much explaination.[...]While these flaws greatly detracted from my playing experience, The story is fairly good, certain levels are very fun, and the game hardly ever throws anything so hard that it's agrivating at you. One battle with a helicopter is a little bit overwhelming, although the hardest part comes at the end of the battle when you have to remember to take off your targeting to hit some enemies.Overall, Syphon Filter is a great game executed poorly, but I have high hopes for the sequal. I hope I'm not let down again.",3,I hope the sequel was better than this,1102896000,"12 13, 2004",-0.0176
