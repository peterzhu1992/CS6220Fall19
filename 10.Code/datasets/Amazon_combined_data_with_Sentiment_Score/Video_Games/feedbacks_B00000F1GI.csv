0,A23SN40DLQYJY1,B00000F1GI,Angela Seaman,"[1, 1]","Tomb Raider 3 is the hardest of the Tomb Raider series (at least in my opinion). It has a very complicated plot, decent graphics, and a moderate amount of action--although I have not completed it myself. It could use more action and less puzzles, however. The biggest problem with it that I've faced is that it has a lot of bugs and errors throughout. Some errors can be fixed without a lot of hassle, others can be fixed but with a lot of hassle, and some can't be fixed at all. Myself, I don't have a lot of patience, I just play the game because I love challenges. So, unless you have a LOT of patience, or enjoy tough challenges like I do, TR3 is not for you.",4,EXTREMELY challenging!!,1089590400,"07 12, 2004",0.0932
1,AAOMG1YP0VNP9,B00000F1GI,Chris 'raging bill' Burton,"[0, 0]","To this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much. Aside from the odd improvement here and there, the games haven't changed vastly (I think Doom to Quake is vastly) at all. I find controlling Lara very clumsey, the 3rd person view not help. Plus, Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something's head off from a distance is non-existent. I found myself fart around half the time. Where's the fun in climbing up a rock face? I'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious. Oh, and Lara Croft is not fit because she's not real and if she was she'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries. So stop ogling at your screen, you sad people!",1,The most over-rated series ever.,988848000,"05 3, 2001",-0.0466
2,A1MS6Z6K4324DL,B00000F1GI,Darren Simpson,"[0, 0]","Better than TR2 for sure. It has some brain taxing levels filled with puzzles, secrets and some enemies. I'm glad to see they have cut back on the enemies and focused on the puzzles and scenery. They have definatly picked some good locations for the game, with brilliant details that are authentic in style. Unfortunatly that is where the authenticity ends.The level makers should have done some research on these locations and made them more like they are in real life. OK, I know it's an adventure game that is meant to be fantasy, but I do feel they could have checked things out first.Examples; India dosn't have pyrannas(Brazil does), the Ganges dosn't end in a pond, St.Pauls Cathedral looks nothing like that(that must be the worst rendition of it yet), the British Museum is not next to the Lloyds building, and Area 51 is more spacious than that(I saw it on a TV programme, I swear). I won't judge the Pacific levels though, I don't know enough about them. They realy do need to watch their locations more.Enjoyable game though.",4,Great imagination but lacking realism.,1032048000,"09 15, 2002",0.0717
3,AU5M0ZJJOW2JW,B00000F1GI,Matt,"[1, 4]","Have you ever sat for hours playing one particular video game and you can never find out what to do? This is one of those games. Although it does hold a great assortment of fun weapons and great graphics, but it's hard. You don't just go around firing guns at everything. Although I did not like the first Tomb Raider either, only because many of the enviroments looked exactly the same though. They both are good games but if your not willing to put a lot of time into video games and just play for fun like me, your not going to like this one.",3,OK OK......................,949190400,"01 30, 2000",0.1727
4,A3AKRQEIX40VWT,B00000F1GI,Michael B.,"[17, 21]","I've conquered hundreds of video games, but unless you have serious amounts of free time on your hand the tomb raider series is not for you. I especially don't like having to get a hint guide to progress through a game. The first tomb raider was difficult, but not unreasonably so, the puzzles made sense. The second one introduced a troubling trend of hiding the solution to puzzles in nonsensical places, and forcing a player to backtrack and turn up the brightness constantly. In this game it is virtually impossible to figure out swiftly where you need to go or what you have to do. With larger levels come an increasingly frustrating inability to simply figure out what you're trying to do in that particular level. I finally gave up after defeating two areas. I refused to buy the hint guide, but after flipping through it I was enraged at how impossible the programmers made it to find the extra weapons and ammo. The game is tough enough already without having to defeat levels with just your pistols if you don't buy the hint guide.Why the hell can't they just make the game fun? the first one was just about right. I'll never have the amount of free time necessary to enjoy this series, which I actually love. I have more fun just wandering around and jumping then trying to defeat needlessly obtuse puzzles. The only area really up to first tomb raider standards are is the south american levels with the giant statues. ARGH.",3,WAY TOO DIFFICULT.,947548800,"01 11, 2000",-0.0057
5,A14T4WS6YCLETD,B00000F1GI,Olivia Virna,"[0, 0]","Tomb Raider 3 was by far the most difficult Tomb Raider I have ever played. I'll admit, I used every cheat in the book in order to beat the game. But can you really blame me?The game first starts off with an incredibly difficult jungle level, in which you have the option of finding a few secrets and then beginning the level, but regardless, you'll be jumping to a slope and then jumping over a set of spikes, and then (surprise!) jumping over another set of spikes, and finally landing at the bottom with a save crystal and a bunch of different directions to go. Don't go into the sinking sand and watch out for anything that looks dangerous because chances are, it'll be the last dangerous think you look at.Finally, after a period of a week to a year, you've finally beat the jungle levels... WITHOUT CHEATS! Well I bet you were quite tempted! Now choose your destination. The strategy guides all tell you to go to the Nevada Desert, and then to the South Pacific, and then London. If you watch the entire Story So far...&quot; feature, you'll notice that the game plays the scenes with South Pacific first and Nevada Desert last. So nobody cares what order you do it in, it doesn't matter much. And believe me; you WILL get frustrated either way, so go to the one you want to go to first because it will take you FOREVER to finish that section of levels.Finally, after God-knows-how-long, you finished the whole globe, and get this; you did it ALL WITHOUT CHEAT CODES! I congratulate you. NOW WE GET TO GO TO ANTARTICA!!!Yippee.Antarctica is incredibly difficult, and it ends with a big, mumbo-jumbo mother-of-all-spiders human-headed thing. Oh, and one shot with the rocket launcher just won't kill it! And one thing to keep on mind, one-hit K.O. As in, if it hits you once, it will kill you. Good luck!But in spite of all of that, I really enjoyed seeing Lara in new costumes and playing in her new house. It was a lot of fun to get the racetrack key and find the shortcut at the racetrack. I must say, I really did enjoy Tomb Raider 3.If you like challenges, then Tomb Raider 3 is definitely for you. And regardless, the Mansion is definitely worth the 5 dollars that Tomb Raider 3 now cost at Game Crazy. But, if you're anything like me and do not enjoy getting so frustrated over a horribly pixilated British woman in a jungle tomb, then get ready to memorize &quot; Draw a flare, take one step forward, one step back, turn around three times, then jump forward&quot; if you want to beat this game!",3,TOO HARD,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",0.066
6,AL6JIT43D8D4Z,B00000F1GI,unraveler unraveler,"[1, 1]","Yes, I did find this a bit cumbersome. I wanted a more puzzle oridented game. I kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walk-through forum to make progress. One of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level, if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance. Lara is a great character. But in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossible-to-discover secrets to make the game truly enjoyable.",4,Few Tasks Too Many,996192000,"07 27, 2001",0.2226
