0,ABRKIJ6D4V42O,B00000JDFT,Amazon Customer space_hamster,"[11, 11]","To be perfectly frank, the Microsoft Sidewinder is the most underrated joystick ever made. My previous joystick was a Logitech Wingman Extreme. Within six months of purchase, the Wingman was falling apart - calibration was non-existent and the rubber case was disintegrating.So I bought the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro. And what a fantastic joystick it was - it's excellent for flight/space simulators like I-War or X-Wing: Alliance. The precision of this joystick is amazing.So, if you're looking for a high-quality joystick at a reasonable price, get this one. It's still one of the most robust and reliable joysticks on the market.",5,The most underrated joystick ever made,968025600,"09 4, 2000",0.4104
1,AT2BYFEVLVITT,B00000JDFT,D. Wetzel,"[15, 16]","This joystick is great for all kinds of games particularly flight sims. I love its rudder controls. All you have to do is twist the stick left or right. It has tons of buttons, all fully programmable. If you want to buy a joystick, definetly purchase this one, don't get the force feedback, that stick is just plain annoying.",5,"Great for flying games, make that all games.",958262400,"05 14, 2000",0.2319
2,A3BUWWG4PQBPEE,B00000JDFT,Marco Rispoli,"[16, 17]","I'm not a great fun of Microsoft but I have to admit that they did a great job with this joystick, just for once. I bought the Saitek Cyborg 3D. Same price. It was horrible. Unstable. It was cool looking but what's the use a cool joystick when you can't land your plane with it because it sends random signals to your pc? Sidewinder is precise and reliable. Also it's multipurpose. I use it for Falcon 4 and Need for Speed and it's great with both.",5,Excellent performance.,946512000,"12 30, 1999",0.1341
3,A231WM2Z2JL0U3,B00000JDFT,Rheumor,"[9, 9]","I have 'flown' regularly for almost 4 years on AirWarrior, using the same stick (non-USB model). It works as well as it did on day #1. The Microsoft site has an updated Win98 control panel for programming the stick (fast, free and easy download) painlessly. It is bullet-proof.",5,The Gold Standard.,970099200,"09 28, 2000",0.2702
4,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00000JDFT,tropic_of_criticism,"[58, 59]","After having tested several joysticks, this is the one I kept coming back to. I've had a version of this joystick on my system for two years, and have yet to find anything better. I don't at all agree with the ...... editorial review that says it's got stiff joystick movement. Quite to the contrary, it's capable of very subtle movement.Plus, it's got lots of features without being over-engineered. I especially like the fact that it comes with both throttle and rudder control within easy reach. The button cluster on the stick itself is very sensibly designed, with all major buttons a comfortable distance apart. The hat is cleverly devised as well, being both solid and flexible. Most importantly, perhaps, the software, now at least two years old, is very stable, and allows you complete control over each button.Yet, there are some people who might not find this product enjoyable. As others have commented, it is a very right-hand-centric design. Since there are a host of buttons on the left-hand side of the base, you can't hold the joystick in your left hand and access those buttons without crossing your hands. Also, the cluster of buttons on the joystick itself are designed to fit the right hand. If you're a right-handed person, this design is ergonomically perfect. It literally fits in the palm of your (right) hand. But a left-handed person has no business whatever buying this product.Neither does a Mac owner. This product's USB connectivity, though convenient to Windows users, does not extend to the Mac. That's an unfortunate oversight that, one suspects, wouldn't be all that difficult to correct.Still, if you only intend to use this thing on a Windows machine, and if you're right handed, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better joystick.",4,"Fabulous for most, but some users left behind by this design",967161600,"08 25, 2000",0.3054
