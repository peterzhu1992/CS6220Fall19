0,A3JG09K1W72Q5,B000006P0J,Brandon,"[3, 4]","Most Teekns fans carer started with Tekken 3. And if you were an aracde aholic, it started with 2. Had this been the easrly 90's this gamewould have got 5 stars hands down. But over the years, this game is aged. Tekken 1, was not an arcade blokc buster, and really came to age on ome systems. Most fans of later tekkens will notice that this game was left for improvements. Thee characters, while perfect stunnning and apporpiate for the early 90's, are blocky and of little detail. although it was light years beyond Virtua Fighter 1. And the fact that this was one ofthe first 3-dgames without chessy ringouts,and a highly detail, and cue combo system. Most fans of later tekken will notice the cheese factor of the gameplay. You could basically, pumble the computer, or an human oppeonent with little ease on the ground. Which was improved in later Tekkens. And the 8 characters, which again was appropiate for the times. The story of this game, goes back to early Tekken. Heatchi(sp?) was the final Boss.And was pretty hard due tothe fact you could be killed with only 3 moves. I dont remember if Devil Kaazu(sp?) was a secret boss. But he was selectable,only through a very hard unlock process. Anyway, I know that the later Tekkens blowthis game way, but his is a classic. Introdcuing oyung versions, of Tekken legends. Law, Paul, and Kaazu(sp?). This is a personal favorite of mines. But the reason for the low rating is the fact that the gameplay was cheesy. Which, again was greatly imporoved upon in later tekkens.",3,An overlooked classic,1009238400,"12 25, 2001",0.0707

Jongeling slice of heaven,"[0, 0]","While the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles, I can't fault this game because this is where it all started.On its own merit in 1995, it was a smash-box hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics, 3d environments, and the musical score. Back then, we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight. This was something completely different. No one cared about the flaws the game had back then. It was par for the course.Now, in 2012, a whole 17 years later (really? that long ago...), a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay, sound, and playability. Sound effects are lo-fi, almost like comparing a cassette to a CD. The soundtrack is still amazing though, as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format. Playability, there is one overall mode - the 1P Arcade mode (unless you count options and 2P). Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose - the same one you fight in round 8. After that, you have all of the characters and there's not much else to do. There's no team battle, no survival, just...1P Arcade. So it works for 1995. The ending movies are pretty bad, all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI. Of course in retrospect, this WAS 1995.The movies never got better in the series until much later, but they did improve some.Overall, Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection, right next to 2 and 3. You won't play it often because Tekken 2 covers all of those bases and more. So to me, at least, this game is merely a collection piece.",4,The building block of the Tekken series,1339200000,"06 9, 2012",0.0706

The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world. This was all in 1995. Now that tekken2 and tekken3 had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland. Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them. And know that games like tekken2, tekken3 and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue. All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken. If tekken had never come out then I believe with a 100% that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance. Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstation.",4,The game that made namco famous,1022630400,"05 29, 2002",0.1536

The only reason I even got this game is because I loved Tekken 2,3,Tag, and 4. The only reason I don't sell this is I want to have all the tekkens, but if you want to buy it, don't pay more than $2 for it.",2,The start of the best game seris ever,1174435200,"03 21, 2007",0.0833

THE FIGHTS ARE ALL FUN, THE GRAPHICS STILL LOOK FANTASTIC EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS NEARLY A DECADE OLD NOW, AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL GOOD AND THE STORYLINES ARE ALL INTERESTING. TO UNLOCK THE BOSSES [WHICH IS THE MAIN THING], YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL WITH THEIR ALREADY AVAILABLE COUNTERPARTS. THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT HEIHACHI [WHICH IS THE MAIN BOSS FOR THIS GAME], YOU GET HIM UNLOCKED. BUT THE REST OF THEM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS THE COUNTERPARTS TO GET THEIR BOSSES. EVEN WITH THE PLAYSTATION 2 AND X BOX AND STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS LIKE THAT ON THE MARKET, MANY OF THE GAMES THEY PUT OUT TODAY CAN'T COMPARE TO CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS! THIS IS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES EVER AND I DARE SAY THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OF THE TEKKEN SERIES.
