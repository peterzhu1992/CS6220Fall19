0,A1JCAHHSO2BRCI,B00000DMAP,Blueblur1984,"[1, 1]",I was actually thinking about this game a few months ago and it was killing me that I couldn't remember the name. This game was a ton of fun though I'm sure if I played it now I would laugh at how dated it is. If you have a way to play this I recommend it. I blew a lot of hours on this game and would gladly pick it up again if they made it available for download on the PS3.,5,Brings back some memories,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",0.2927
1,A2OVX97R347HXC,B00000DMAP,chiatroll,"[6, 7]","Azure Dreams isn't really like other RPGs. It's actually more of a random dungeon game. Like Chocobo Dungeon and Diablo. These games really seem to fit into there own category these days. Also it has a monster training part to it where you brought you monster in the dungeon to fight for you. Also within the game is a very weird part of plot. You get to sees the faces of the women you have gotten to become your loyal women while you save. If you run the story correctly on all of them in the end your basically the town pimp.As far as game play goes when entering the dungeon you are always brought down to level 1 and only able to take 5 items inside. This is an annoying thing. Your monsters do not loose levels but as they survive they loose magic and leave way to fast. Also to keep your weapons in poor shape early you well have problems with rust traps, which lower their quality. Also there are items they raise the quality of the weapon and shield (only equipment you wear) threw the game called sands. A good thing to remember is gold swords do not rust, neither do diamond or mirror shields. Without knowing that the game can get pretty boring faster. The game is very repetitive. You end up doing the same thing over and over again while you get to the deeper levels of the dungeon again and again. Even though they change every time it does get old to meet the same monsters hoping for a sand so you can get to the next floor again and again and again. I fell asleep while playing this game at least six times.As far as plot goes the plot within 27 hours of playing you well forget the game had a plot and you well only be reminded in the very end.The graphics to this game are sprits. They are not poorly done sprites but I have seen higher quality. There are many different looking monsters and every couple floors the dungeon's floor takes a new appearance. But eventually it does some repeating and none of the pictures are that beautiful.And finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting it depends on how patient you are. This game involves a lot of patience. Even though I fell asleep while playing it many times I enjoyed it all the way until I beat it, but if you are going to play it its defiantly a buy game and not a rent game.Overall this game is not for everyone, but if your very patient and you have a lot of free time to see a weird game that combines monster raising, dungeon exploring, and... RPG style control to dating. Get Azure dreams.",3,Not for those who lack patience,964742400,"07 28, 2000",0.0967
2,A1COB2ZPCP370D,B00000DMAP,Danielle Richard,"[0, 0]","Fans of any oldschool dungeon crawler should snap this game up. In a similar style to other games of the time, you assume the roll of a monster hunter with a mission to climb a mysterious tower following in your father's footsteps.Some may say the graphics are dated. I feel that they are nostalgic. With randomly-generated dungeons, spelunking is always a grand adventure. A must-have for any RPG lover!",5,A classic PS1 game.,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",0.2545

4,A38AXXL7DMVFMQ,B00000DMAP,Vicente Drago Shaun O'Donnell,"[25, 25]","9 out of 10 people will probably see this, and pass it up as another cheap RPG, for one thing you only have 1 dungeon (gasp) when you leve you level back down to 1 (GAsp), and you capture monster just like in Pokemon (GASP). No it's not a compelation of rip off's, this is a classic that is highly addicting, and incredibly fun, if given a chance.The story revolves around a young lad (you name) who on his fifteenth birthday is given the opportunity to become a hunter and explore the depths of the Monster Tower to retrieve riches, however to do so he must not only survive, but grow as a trainer and as a man. In comes the Kewe, the monster you will likely use for a majority of the game. He is a fire type (there are only three types) and he is your brief tutorial, and key to success early on.... YOu also must build up your respect to the townsfolk, to do this you must enlarge certain places (Temple, Hospital) and build new things (Library, Gym, Casino, Race Track, Bowling Alley ect..) and the town will grow to respect you.Now as for the tower it'self, there are 40 floors, everytime you leave you go back down to level 1. No it's not immpossible for two reasons.A) Your monsters level stays the same when you leave, this is due to the fact that they are more like equipment.B) Weapons and armors stay the same, when a red or blue sand is used your weapons and armor grow more powerful, so technically you can easily dominate the first few levels without you monsters assistance.Overall this game is tricky, you will die the first few times (lose all your items except monsters) but once they are strong enough you can succeed. There are 40 randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along. YOu must adjust your mosnters accordingly by class.A)FireB)WindC)WaterFire beats Wind, Water beats Fire, Wind Beats Water.I would buy this for the challenge it possess, guarennteed addiction.",5,"An underrated classic, from the makers of Metal Gear Solid",1015804800,"03 11, 2002",0.2516
