1,A3J8ZMGDTADUN5,B00000IZ8A,Daniel Garcia Montes,"[0, 0]","Boy, this game was a real disappointment. I truly expected better for this game, since it was based on a truly cool, badass movie. The main reason why it wasn't so good is because of its difficulty... this game was incredibly difficult! Even with the Player's Guide it was very difficult to beat! The last time I played it was probably 2 to 3 years ago though, and back then I wasn't as skilled as I am now at video game playing... maybe I'll give it a second chance. Still, its chances of not being sold or something are not really good.After all the reviews that I read, I thought that when I tried my buddy's game Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles on my step-brother's Dreamcast that it would [stink]completely... but in fact it was the exact opposite. All the reviews I read kept saying how Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace was way better thanStar Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles... boy were those reviews experiencing strong cases of irony. Jedi Power Battles was a lot more fun than The Phantom Menace, and it was at a good level of difficulty. Too bad I didn't beat it though, my step-brother doesn't have a Memory Card for his Dreamcast. If you're a HUGE fan of Star Wars, then don't get this game... you'll end up destroying the game after you see how many pointless missions you have to go through and how many impossibly difficult leaders you have to face: 1) Jabba the Hut's champion fighter, 2) a huge and hairy beast, 3) a thief who stole a part from Anakin's podracer, 4) a Coruscant mercenary, 5) and ofcourse the incredibly powerful Darth Maul. Sure, it may SOUND easy, but wait till you hear this... you don't always play as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi; in quite a few levels you are forced to play as Captain Panaka and even...gulp... Queen Amidala! Really, I'm not kidding.",2,"I really expected better, but it may not be too late...",1023235200,"06 5, 2002",-0.1933

You get to play a lot of diffrent characters, like, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Amidala & Captian Panaka. It woyuld be cool if they let you play Jar Jar Binks, but they don't. Oh, weel. Jar jar is one of my Favorite Characters in the film. the best part is you get to battle darth Maul. and it goes along with the movie too. This game rocks. This is a must have game for all star wars fans.If you liked this game then check out all of the other Star wars games",5,May The Force Be With You,1147219200,"05 10, 2006",0.218
3,A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I,B00000IZ8A,GameraRocks captpicardfan,"[6, 7]","I've played this game many, many times. But unfortunately, it's one of those games that you will either love or hate, which you can tell by the reviews here and I love it.This game is pretty lengthly, gives you a choice of things to say in response to questions and is overall fun, especially since you get to play the entire movie. I recommend this game to die hard fans, but like I said, don't be surprised if for some reason you don't like it. Some do, some don't. Simple as that",5,Very Fun Game,1125014400,"08 26, 2005",0.1945
4,A1SF5QI677TQYK,B00000IZ8A,Jason Anderson,"[0, 0]","I loved the game the first time i played it through, but as with MOST (not all) games, it got boring the second time around...:(...It strays far from the movie. It has the basic characters, but is not like the movie. You will recognize a few items and place from the movie...like the palace, of the last part of the game, where you defeat Darth Maul, but it was just kind of a game to sell and make money...It's fun, but doesn't lastJason Anderson",3,"Great Game, but Gets old",980726400,"01 29, 2001",0.0637
5,A3KMEUY129LFLH,B00000IZ8A,Jason,"[0, 0]",Everything was in good shape when it arrived. It arrived in a timely manner. It completed my set of Star Wars games for the PSONE. It went well with my set.,5,PSONE Game,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",0.0391
6,A18251WJ7U5XS9,B00000IZ8A,Matt,"[0, 2]",This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!,1,Awsome Movie Horrible Game,1001894400,"10 1, 2001",-0.1665
7,AGYKGNTF1JGRP,B00000IZ8A,Mr. Espinosa,"[0, 0]",I bought this game because I played it before on my PS2. I know the graphics aren't that great but the storyline follows the movie somewhat closely...I am having a blast reminiscing the old times...,5,Good memories...,1375747200,"08 6, 2013",0.028
8,A3MCS7WC9OD1FF,B00000IZ8A,Zane Hasan,"[0, 0]",Its a great game and really fun but also challenging at time. The game basically follows the movie with some extras here and there. The graphics are not the greatest but that is to be expected since its a Playstatin game. But overall i would say its a fun game and replayable.,4,A Great Game But Graphics Are No So Great,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",0.267
