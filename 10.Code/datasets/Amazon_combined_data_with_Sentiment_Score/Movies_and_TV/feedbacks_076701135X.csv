You won't find a better written, more perfectly cast, gloriously acted, and funnier show anywhere. However, these 8 episodes are by no means the best ones. -They're all waiting to be released. Hopefully &quot;New Video&quot; will put the whole series out. No other sit-com deserves it more, I can assure you. So please, how about it ?. But in the meantime, get this box and wet your appetite.

1,A3K74JJXH3QAFS,076701135X,DPK,"[25, 28]","There are two things that must be said about WKRP in Cincinatti. The first is that it was arguably the best workplace sitcom of the last thirty years. The other is that it deserves better treament for a video release than it's received thus far.For my part, I didn't really notice the absence of particular songs in the set (which has been a prized possession for years). I was too engrossed in the episodes themselves thanks to the excellent scripts and performances.That said, I would probably be willing to pay a few bucks more to pay for having the original music choices reinstated. The notion that the absence of the original songs is somehow a justification for piracy, however, is just madness. Putting aside the fact that it's criminal, it's also illogical as it punishes the people whose work these fans claim to admire so much. If one truly loves and respects the work of the many talented people who made WKRP, then they should realize that buying and selling pirated copies, depriving those artists of fair compensaiton for their work, is simply wrong.I love WKRP and I'll be among the first to pre-order if it finally sees the light of day. Until then, those who really respect the makers of the show (behind and in front of the camera) should be patient. A lot of music-intensive shows (Freaks & Geeks and SCTV being two examples) have managed to get on the market with their original music intact, so there's hope. I'll choose hope over self-centered criminal activity any day.",3,WKRP Deserves Better But Let's Not Be Criminal About It,1109721600,"03 2, 2005",0.3377
2,A1A535W556ROBQ,076701135X,James Ferguson,"[4, 5]","With all the DVD releases of vintage comedies, one has to ask why WKRP remains in VHS only? This was a great comedy, on par with such classic 80's sitcoms as Taxi and Barney Miller, yet it finds itself in video purgatory, along with other great shows of the era such as St. Elsewhere. It took awhile for WKRP to establish an audience. I remember how it got pushed around from one time slot to another, never getting the attention it deserved then. But, it produced such memorable characters, with Loni Anderson, Tim Reid and Howard Hesseman all enjoying success after WKRP, albeit Loni never got as good a role as she had as Jennifer. I suppose it is only a matter of time before we see it on DVD, but it has been an irritatingly long wait.",3,Deserves to be released in DVD,1152576000,"07 11, 2006",0.2156

Unfortunately, it is also the most heavily edited, or as I prefer to call it, censored, ones.Get these tapes while they are still in print if you can swing it, you won't be sorry to have them.I don't look for the studio to pump money into an old show and ever release the full series uncut with original dialogue, minutes, and music on DVD or VHS, and too bad.

I'm talking about FREAKS AND GEEKS.Another brilliant show whose DVD success MORE than made up for it's costs to license the incredible soundtrack.Knowing that WKRP was considerably more successful during it's original tenure on CBS should be proof positive that this would be well worth the investment in releasing it with all original music intact.",3,Why not WKRP???,1150070400,"06 12, 2006",0.9517

Even though it only lasted 3 seasons there has seldom been a sitcom to come along that so successfully satirized pop culture in such a believable manner.Real fans should start a letter writing campaign to whomever owns the release rights to WKRP and demand that it be released on DVD in its entirety as it aired originally, uncut.",1,Very sad.,1063929600,"09 19, 2003",-0.039

It was the right cast at the right time and everything else about it was just...right.The only reason I titled my review, Almost Perfect is because in the versions of the show you see now, all the old rock music has been deleted and replaced with studio recordings of the songs by unknown artists or just bland anonymous music. If you saw the series when it aired in the 70s, it was true to what it was...a rock and roll radio station playing the big artists of the 70s. Thanks to the lawyers and greedy music companies, the original music that was in the series got surgically removed and replaced by what you'll hear now. Don't get me wrong...the show is still HILARIOUS. It's just not as perfect as it was when it originally aired. Hopefully at some point in the future, some smart cookie will release WKRP in its original form as it aired on CBS.This show should be up there with M*A*S*H and All in the Family so far as history goes. It's really THAT GOOD. From hearing Les Nessman describe live turkeys hit the pavement like bags of wet cement to Arthur Carlson slap his foot to wake it up because he thought he was putting on foot powder that turned out to really be cocaine, it's one funny episode after another.Don't bother renting the episodes that aired after they tried to revive the show in the 80s without Andy Travis and much of the original cast. It's like Caddyshack 2: a poor, poor attempt to recapture the magic of the original. The original episodes that aired in the late 70s are GOLDEN though. Rent 'em, buy 'em or whatever. Just be prepared to laugh and laugh a lot if you've never seen WKRP before or if you haven't seen it in a long time.",4,Almost Perfect,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",0.4108

A great idea, as this was a consistently well-written show, and one of the more intelligent ones from its era, but New Video has done the show an injustice by:A. Releasing only eight episodesB. Using masters with the original rock music used during the network run replaced by stock musicC. At times, resorting to substandard and/or edited copies.Now that 20th Century Fox Home Video owns the rights to this and the rest of the MTM Productions library, it is time to beg them for a DVD release of all 90 episodes unedited and with the original music restored!",3,WKRP deserves better treatment,994464000,"07 7, 2001",0.1199
8,A2JFOHC9W629IE,076701135X,scott_from_dallas,"[3, 6]","I loved the series, and I would have put my collection together a little differently, but so would anyone. One myth that has been perpetrated here has to stop: The Consultant was NOT one of the better episodes. Yes, it had a really good 5 minutes or so when the cast assumes Travis' &quot;fake&quot; roles to get his former buddy to sound uncredible. Those 5 minutes were fine; the other 18 minutes or so of the show was boring. And while the Turkey one was a classic, there was 1 episode I would have loved to be one here. The one where Carlson ran for city council against some creep they found out had a drinking problem. This show had probably the greatest Les Nessman line of all time: when they found out the drunk opponent had fallen into his dinner at a convention honoring Armenian Americans (or something like that), Les said &quot;Why are Armenians eating Lasagne?&quot; Anyone who eats lasagne with me for the rest of my life will hear that, regardless of whether they've seen the show or not. Totally irrelevant and off the wall -- just like the entire series.In terms of the tape, the line of the show has to go to Venus. In the pilot, when mamma learns of the format change and the emergence of Dr. Johnny Fever, she is flabbergasted, wondering what next. Venus then walks in shouting, &quot;Andy, my man!&quot; A....Buy the tape, even if you've never seen the show. You will, like me, wonder where good t.v. went.",5,"More Great Shows, Less Nessman",990921600,"05 27, 2001",0.2546

Since then I've been pondering what other TV shows I enjoyed enough to warrant buying episodes on DVD. WKRP tops the very short list (#2 is the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, and the list ends there). Did someone here refer to Jan Smithers (Bailey Quarters) as truly lovely? Amen, brother!I logged onto Amazon tonight specifically to see if a WKRP DVD is available and I had just missed it. No such luck. Interestingly, I see that Gilligan's Island IS out on disc...yeah, that makes sense.Thank you to the folks here who warned of the edits made on the VHS product. I'd have purchased them and been very disappointed. I anxiously await a quality DVD reissue. My credit card is ready.

I'm about as disappoitned as anyone that the original shows aren't being aired with the music that was featured back then. Being in radio myself, I understand the royalty issue that must be dealt with before the show has any chance of seeing the light of day on DVD, but so many people loved this show that it deserves far better than the generic stock music that's in any repeats that show these days unless your local TV station happened to have purchased (and hung onto) one of the older syndication packages from when the show was distributed by Victory television and features the actual songs. The dubbed version just isn't the same, and there were classic storylines throughout the entire four season run of the show. Please Fox, do us all a favor, spend the time and money and do this show right. There's an audience waiting...and finally (and somewhat off-topic): I have to disagree with the reviewer that said M*A*S*H lacked timelessness in its humor. A minor gripe in a review of another show that was a brilliant piece of ensemble work. WKRP was cancelled by CBS, the network claiming low ratings as the reason (it was #7 and had only been moved a dozen times or more)...to bring the shows to DVD (done correctly) would be the ultimate justice done to a show that had so many injustices done to it, and if it's made available, enough people will buy it, trust me!",2,A proper treatment for this show is WAY overdue...,1141862400,"03 9, 2006",0.4625
