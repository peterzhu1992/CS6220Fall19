The footage is pretty good and includes many scenes I have never seen before. If youre a fan of the color film documentaries of WWII, this one should be in your collection.",5,Good documentary,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",0.5816
1,A2V3E9U7IM8EU2,767026977,bruce horner,"[111, 115]","This is an astonishing set of videos. First there is the jaw-dropping, almost hallucinogenic experiance of seeing WWII events in technicolor. It reminds one of how much black-and-white film aestheticizes and abstracts events. Admittedly our eyes don't see in technicolor either, but the color makes you feel far more psychologically &quot;there&quot; so to speak. The second thing is the amazing quality of most of this footage. It hardly seems to have aged at all in 55-60 years! When you consider that film from the 1960's sometimes looks atrociously degraded and washed out, the almost pristine look of this footage is remarkable to say the least. It must have been stored well and never projected. (Of course, the producers could choose the best-looking bits from what was reputedly hundreds of hours of rediscovered film.) Watching this film is a tremendously emotional experiance, sometimes frightening, sometimes grueling, sometimes stomach-turning. The voice-over narration makes heavy use of contemporary letters and diaries of soldiers and civilians, and is often touching. The cumulative impact of all this----the island fighting, Nazi rallies, shipyard workers, civilians hanged by Nazis, radiation victims, Pearl Harbor wreckage, air war footage, death camps, and on and on----is almost overwhelming. Like having your nose shoved into the sheer mess and folly of mass war.Now that I hear that the UK version of this documentary was narrated by the redoubtable John Thaw I'd love to see THAT version, but otherwise I unreservedly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Too many people think of documentaries as boring but this demonstrates how mesmerizing they can be. For anyone too young to have first-hand memories of it (which is most of the population now) this makes WWII far more visceral than you ever thought possible.",5,"Eerie, hypnotic, gut-wrenching",973036800,"11 1, 2000",0.0246

I thought that color film wasn't even invented prior to WW II. Ted Turner can colorize anything these days, even WW I, but this is the real thing and you can tell. Very nice indeed",5,I was amazed when I saw some of this as a child,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",0.2423
3,A39AE1NTFL6YUY,767026977,horoscopy,"[1, 5]","For the price of these documentaries,,,the color footage is definitely worth 5 stars.(if you pay under 7 dollars).The quality of the color footage is very very good..and not seen in other documentaries I have seen (I have seen most of the ones on Amazon).HOWEVER.... the History Channel takes the footage and mixes it with its USUAL propaganda and more propaganda stories than talking obectively about WW2. and what happened in the war. so much of the time you will be watching a propaganda story and footage associated with it..and not hearing about the stages of the war.nice if turn the sound down and just watch what there is interesting only.",2,nice color footage..too bad the History Channel narrated it,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",-0.1087
4,A17JVI15BRY90P,767026977,James T. Wheeler,"[9, 9]","Based on reviews I'd read beforehand, I expected something big with this 2-disc set. To its credit, it runs 2 hours and 51 minutes. But it's on the pricey side and a lot of what's shown here has been on other more recent (and less expensive) DVD's, like Hitler, in Color, which is really outstanding. I also expected this DVD set to be better than World War II in Color, the British Story. On the contrary, the latter costs less than half of this one, ran over an hour longer and had more unique footage and commentary. The British Story is all on a single, collector's edition, digital disc.For those building a DVD library on World War II, especially color features, this 2-volume set belongs in your collection. For those operating on a budget, choose the two DVD's noted above, first. Then, consider Visions of War, Vol. 2--Hitler, in His Own Words, and various pieces on Winston Churchill, for greater value.",4,"Good, not great",1151971200,"07 4, 2006",0.0602
5,A10ODC971MDHV8,767026977,John Farr,"[3, 5]","History and war buffs, rejoice. Just when you thought you'd seen every World War II documentary, from The World At War to Victory At Sea, this set appears. While you may not glean a wealth of new information or insight into the period, the color films imbue the war with an immediacy you've never experienced before- unless of course, you were there. This alone makes the DVD a worthwhile investment of time and money. Bear in mind this is all bona-fide color footage-nothing has been colorized. The effect is spellbinding, almost miraculous- as when Judy Garland as Dorothy first lands in Oz.",5,World War II - The Lost Color Archives,1185753600,"07 30, 2007",-0.2898
6,A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2,767026977,"Lawrence Wegeman, Jr.","[0, 0]","I am adding this set to a DVD collection consisting of: World War II in color Thunderbolt; World War II in color The Fighting Lady; World War II in Color; World War II in HD The Air War; Victory at Sea; and D-Day Remembered (a total of eleven discs). I can frankly say that The Lost Color Archives set does contain new, never before seen footage and in color.No new flying sequences or ground fighting film, but seen here is prisoner of war footage and many striking civilian realities. I never knew that when the Russians took Berlin, every Russian soldier was given three days to enter any home or apartment and take what he or she wanted; a grim reminder of hell.Home movies of Hitler and Eva Brown and others are shown during leisure moments. The walk-through of German citizens ordered by the American authority at the site of a newly liberated concentration camp. Horrific!Many scenes of English life during and after the bombings and I could go on.This set is a worthwhile addition to what I have listed above. All are available at amazon.com.",5,Invaluable Archives,1322870400,"12 3, 2011",-0.332
7,A2IZMNBGU043WW,767026977,M. Anderson,"[13, 13]","Apart from the obvious important issue of color, &quot;Lost Color Archives&quot; is different from many other documentaries dealing with World War II. The emphasis is much less on causes and facts than it is on the impact of the war on society and individuals. Its use of personal observances is remeniscent of the way Ken Burns used eye witness accounts in &quot;The Civil War&quot; to make more of an impact on the viewer.Evenso, from a historical perspective, &quot;Lost Color Archives&quot; does deserve high praise as a solid explanation of the war as a whole. Because it is told largely from the eye witness point of view, the viewer has a sense of the impending conflict, then the endurance through the war, and finally, the exhausted conclusion. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the war was over, but that much of the world had been destroyed and that the effects and rememberance of the war would linger on.Add color to all this and the documentary clearly stands above anything else I've ever seen about the war. Some of the images are average, some are stunning, some are beautiful, some are horrifying, but all are in color.The combination of the color video and the first person narratives often sent chills down my spine.",5,Very Good Documentary Even if it Were Not in Color,1068163200,"11 7, 2003",-0.4237
8,A2R6RA8FRBS608,767026977,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[2, 2]","World War II--The Lost Color Archives gives people a rare opportunity to essentially witness World War II as it actually looked in color. The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white. The quality of the sound is excellent. Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes!The first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King (George) in Great Britain. We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler; Hitler sure had them fooled! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.The first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop the bomb on Japan.In addition, there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die. The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.The second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war. We see D Day, the rescue of France, other countries, and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler's German military machine. The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing, damage from bombing and carnage. It's truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.The DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs. What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color. There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best. We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities--and more. This is excellent bonus footage and it lasts about twenty minutes.Overall, I highly recommend this two DVD package for history buffs, military buffs and veterans of World War II. This color footage is actually quite rare and I believe that it has great historical significance.",5,simply incredible,1197072000,"12 8, 2007",0.0988

As a teacher there are many chapters that can be selectively used in the classroom on a variety of WWII topics and themes. Since it is in color, it is also more appealing to the students.

The colour and quality of these two DVDs brings to life the horror and grim reality of WW2. They give a brief and tragic insight to what it was like to experience the second global war, not only from a soldiers view point but also a civilian's one. The focus is more on the human element of the war rather than strategic or tactical view and makes good use of diary and letter extracts to compliment the unforgetable colour images.The only disappointing feature was that the review on the back of the first DVD suggested there would be combat coverage of the Battle of Staingrad, however this coverage was merely in the form of colour still shots unlike all the other images in this DVD set.Potential buyers from Australia and New Zealand should note that this has viewed on T.V. as &quot;The Color of War&quot; and not to confuse it with something different.Everyone should view this DVD to get a feel and an appreciation for this particular period of time.",4,Essential Viewing,976924800,"12 16, 2000",-0.2222
