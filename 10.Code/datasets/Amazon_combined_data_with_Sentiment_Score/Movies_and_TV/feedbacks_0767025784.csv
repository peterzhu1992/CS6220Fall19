1,A387BW88BNNKF6,767025784,cstr8,"[0, 0]",I own many WWII documentaries and you just never know when you will find a gem or a clunker. This one is a clunker. It was a disappointment because of the loud background music. I don't really need the music to tell me how to react to what is on the screen. I found the music distracting. I didn't learn anything new from this video that I have not seen in others. I would not recommend buying this one.,1,Put me to sleep,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",-0.1546

3,A2SN7NDKDZTLF1,767025784,Joseph B. Cox Jr. Train Jazzman,"[1, 1]","As History Channel videos go this received only favorable marks. I was a bit disappointed with this DVD set. It was very general and vague in the description of &#34;the blunders&#34;. Most of the information contained in this set is covered in much greater detail in other WW II video series; for example &#34;The World at War&#34;. The footage is the typical footage of WW II as found in other series (no surprise) and there is nothing fresh or new. The factual content is on the mark so if one is looking for a series that has decent footage and commentary, then one should consider this set. This set is just OK.",3,Great Blunders of WW II is a Blunder,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",0.0326
4,A3NZVCL9N8CLHB,767025784,"Logical Paradox Irrational, but True","[40, 40]","Great Blunders of WWII is a fabulous 2 disc set from The History Channel portraying some of the most memorable blunders made by both sides during the second world war. These blunders include: The German failure to destroy the allied forces at Dunkirk, Hitler's declaration of war on the U.S., The pilot who bombed London, mistakes of the Luftwaffe, Hitler's blunder at Stalingrad, The failure of the plan to invade Britain, Japan's mistakes at Midway, and a few others.There's 8 roughly half hour episodes, plus an additional four bonus blunders (including the bomb plot to kill hitsler and the mistakes of the battle of the bulge) - a total of 10 episodes for over 5 hours of WWII blunder goodness.The Series is Narrative in nature, using archival footage and occasional graphics for effect. Over-all my impressions are good, I've been a fan of the series for some time. The episodes are entertaining and accurate, however the short episode length means that detail and depth is sometimes lacking. Also another good point is that this series is still on History Channel and History International Channel fairly frequently - so the price seems pretty high for something you could easily watch on tv or record.Also it's worth pointing out that this set was formed from the Great Military Blunders series and is merely a SELECTION of episodes related to wwII from that series. They left out quite a few episodes of the series that both pertain to the second world war and are excellent - that's really sad. An episode on the failure of the Maginot Line, an episode on Hitler's Invasion of the USSR, and an episode on the mistakes of Pearl Harbor come to mind as VERY noteable exclusions from this set. That really disapoints me. Im also sad to see the rest of the series seems to not be available on either DVD or VHS.If you like history channel and are interested in WWII and the colosal blunders made during it's course, then this set will be very enjoyable - though the more you like it the more you'll wish they included the other related episodes and the more you'll wish each episodes was longer and went into more depth and detail about the blunders. But overall it's a great series, in an incomplete package, and it will be up to you to decide whether or not owning it on DVD is worth the pricetage.",4,wonderful but over-priced,1116979200,"05 25, 2005",0.2188
5,A2YHU2LV32CKNO,767025784,Todd Bradley,"[19, 21]","I learned a lot about World War II history by watching this series. The 2 DVD set consists of several programs that were created by the History Channel, and so each segment does have a definite &quot;made for TV&quot; feel to it. But each segment is also a nice easy-to-watch bitesize piece of history. I had hoped Netflix had this for rent, but since they didn't I ended up buying it. Unfortunately, it's the kind of thing I'll probably only watch once. But it's definitely entertaining and educational.",4,Good way to learn WWII history,999043200,"08 29, 2001",0.1873
