Did not really know JB before so i approached it with an open mind. I don't like his overexaggerated singing much, he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan (personal opinion) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best. The other guys look bored and i got the impression the only time they enjoyed themselves was during the heavier songs like 'kick out the jams'. The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah' but even that dragged out too much. A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop.",1,Can't see the hype,1090886400,"07 27, 2004",0.3019

Lane baronl,"[1, 2]",The darkness and romantic elements of Mr. Buckley's stories seem to lead quite fittingly to him drowning at a young age in the mythic Mississippi river. This is a great show from an exceptional talent. Mr. Buckley performs like a man possessed.I had to take back a copy of this DVD because of digital noise aroung Lilac Wine.

2,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,738900672,Christopher Culver,"[9, 21]","LIVE IN CHICAGO is a complete concert from Jeff Buckley's Mystery White Boy tour of 1995, which promoted his first album GRACE. While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with Dream Brother, proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. Mojo Pin, So Real, and Grace were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's Kick Out the Jams, which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song Vancouver (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's Kanga Roo. Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover Kanga Roo after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. So Real and Last Goodbye had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date. Listeners who merely enjoy the magic of GRACE can safely pass this DVD by. It's pleasant, but nothing special.",3,An entertaining - but unessential - concert film,1036368000,"11 4, 2002",0.565

Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art. It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing. That's not a bad thing. Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them. Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be. I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure. I recommend this highly. Just don't expect the greatest sound, and look for the magic in the songs.",4,Jeff's Chicago Gig,1094774400,"09 10, 2004",0.097

6,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,738900672,Marc Cabir Davis,"[6, 7]","As other reviewers have pointed out, this is indeed a stellar concert, but there are two problems that plague it:1. Camera Angles : The entire video recording is very 'amateur', to say the least. Most of Jeff is captured with very bad lighting, sometimes he is obscured in the dark completely. Also, the camera sometimes lingers on the same spot for too long with no other angles to speak of (possibly because there were no other cameras?) and even if you're a huge Jeff fan (as I am), this could be tiresome.2. The Sound : I was not entirely happy with the audio of this recording. Most of it is obscured by the audience screaming and there is a perceptible hiss that runs through the background permanently. This is not a good thing at all. In fact, some songs that require a delicate rendition such as 'Lilac Wine' have possibly been ruined by the weak transfer of audio. I suspect the original recording itself wasn't that clear, which is why.3. Special Features : Now, heres the thing. When Jeff had only one actual studio album in his lifetime, how on earth would a 'Discography' section benefit a true fan of his? It does not make any sense. Of course you get listings of everything he's ever worked on (such as 'Sketches' and his earlier collaboration album) but I would hardly call this a special feature.The good part of this is that this remains the only officially commissioned Jeff Buckley video recording out there. Under Mary, his mother, much more archived video has been promised to us, his fans. As a starter kit, this works fine. Jeff was ON this night, and brought a lot of tenderness to his performance. Watching this more than ten years since his death, its very nostalgic and inspiring. Then you think of whats on the radio these days and miss the time when you could actually listen to Jeff Buckley on radio. Where have those days gone?I consider Jeff Buckley to be the closest thing to a perfect male musician. Apart from his obvious ethereal beauty, his voice remains truly a divine gift that hasn't diminished in its' resonance through the years. I think that had he lived, he would certainly be regarded as some sort of pioneer. Sadly, all we have are remnants such as this DVD release. Get this today. Like I said, its not great, but its all we have of Jeff.Five Stars for the man and his music. Three Stars for the DVD. I'm rounding the rating out to a total of four Stars.",4,The Most Beautiful Voice in the World Deserved Better!,1190851200,"09 27, 2007",0.024

Halpern,"[3, 3]","To anyone who, like me, only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death, this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago. The concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program, giving it a very intimate quality. The ENTIRE show is here, all the banter between songs, the calls from the crowd. The DVD is excellent, two seperate sound mixes, regular CD quality PCM and a remixed Dolby Surround 5.1 mix. Two bonus acoustic songs and a press kit round out the DVD - worth every penny.",5,Missed opportunities...,957916800,"05 10, 2000",0.4455
8,A3GW8RC5RE1W6S,738900672,M. Fantino,"[56, 58]","Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release. It took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in 1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn't?) and also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer. I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena's laugh, to a goldfish burble, to a puma's roar. And his guitar playing can trigger memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I Know It's Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley. He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a certain part of your own life (or at least that's how it feels). Lines like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot; are so intimate and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I can't help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering of Big Star's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You're just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you'd expect at a Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams, featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life, for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl. They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that are equally haunting. Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It's good, get it.",5,Just like St. Joan,965865600,"08 10, 2000",0.4322

Lachance,"[10, 11]","I was a big Jeff Buckley fan before Grace was released, the Live at Sine' EP CD was so great i was primed and ready when Grace hit the shelves. I turned at least several friends on to Jeff and for a while felt I was the only one who had even heard of him. When Last Goodbye hit the radio I was ecstatic. After all this i passed up at least 2 opportunities to see him live during his tours in 1995 and 1996. This DVD made me regret those decisions even more. As has been stated, THIS IS THE WAY A CONCERT DVD SHOULD BE. Live in Chicago blew me away. I thought I knew what to expect. I knew it would be a good concert. I bought the Mystery White Boy CD that was recently released, and thought THAT was an eye opener. This DVD leaves the CD WAY behind. All i can say is if you never saw Jeff in concert, you owe it to yourself to experience something like this. He was not a &quot;star&quot; or an &quot;icon&quot;. Jeff Buckley was a life.

10,A2544TAZJ80RX0,738900672,M. Palmer QFLW,"[3, 3]","this recorded performance might take some getting used to. It was my first experience of either Buckley or his music--sort of a head-first, full-bore dive. Was curious because of how many people I'd heard rave about him (Elton John mentions his Grace album on Rufus Wainwright's All I Want DVD).Something of a head-bending experience; found the performance discomfiting yet likeable. Buckley was obviously quite talented. The music & lyrics are sensitive, astute, impassioned, sometimes beautiful, but his Robert-Plant-in-the-extreme singing (and I love Plant) and the moody, bleak atmosphere of the performance took work getting into, driving some doubt that this was a taste I could acquire. But so far I think I like him enough to try. The sincere but unmalicious way he finally said f--- off, just f--- off to individuals who kept shouting for Hallelujah or making other unintelligible commentary could well have clinched it, lol. By interrupting flow & breaking the mood again and again, the play Hallelujah! crier seemed to get the performance even less than me.

12,A37S3ACL57LN62,738900672,Samantha Glasser Maliejandra,"[1, 1]","Live in Chicago is an excellent release for Jeff Buckley fans who never got to see Buckley in concert. Not only did he come alive on a stage, but he became more human and interesting. Here the imperfections are intact which sometimes make for the best performances. There are spurts of humor, improvised lyrics, and touching spots of Jeff relating to the audience. This isn't a particularly important concert; it isn't his first nor his last. However, it's being average works well to provide insight into what a typical Buckley concert would be. One word describes it: amazing. The extra features are just as good. There are two acoustic tracks of So Real and Last Goodbye as well as an Electronic Press Kit with interviews with Jeff.The camera work is not extremely professional or glamorous. It seems to be recorded on a home video camera with some abilities in effects and use of several angles, but this is no-frills videography. That is not what makes the DVD great; Jeff does that. Buckley is uninhibited and lost in his songs. During Mojo Pin, mid-note he seems startled by the audience's reaction to his singing as if he had forgotten they were there. He often closes his eyes, deep in his own world of memories and thoughts gone by. Though the DVD was recorded years ago, it flows well and still seems spontaneous (although the track list is available on the back cover).The other band mates do not seem as into the music as Jeff, so Buckley is the focus of the show, the obvious front-man. But he does not neglect his friends either.The end of the performance gives us Jeff with his eyes filled with adoration for his fans saying, I love you too. This is perhaps one of the best gifts current Buckley fans could get, the affirmation that with the intense love fans have for Buckley, he had love for them too and extreme love for performing.Jeff could teach us all a thing or two about music.",5,Enthralling,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",0.3675

Yes, that's right - this concert is magical, transcendent, and just absolutely gorgeous.Jeff Buckley had a penchant for writing amazing songs, and they are on display full-force here.
