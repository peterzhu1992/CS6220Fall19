0,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,718000315,Alejandra Vernon artist & illustrator,"[43, 44]","This is a lovingly crafted production of The Gospel According to Matthew, and is a treasure to own for repeated viewing. Filmed in Cape Town, South Africa, it is visually beautiful, with marvelous detail in the costuming and set design; it has a cast of mostly unknown actors, anchored by Richard Kiley and Bruce Marchiano. Notable in the cast is Gerrit Schoonhoven, wonderful as Peter, and Marcel Van Heerden as John the Baptist.Kiley is fabulous as an aging Matthew, who is dictating his gospel to two scribes, and with his resonant voice he narrates portions of the dramatization of Jesus' life.Bruce Marchiano is remarkable in the long and difficult part of Jesus. His portrayal is strong, warm and accessible. It is a Jesus who laughs and hugs people, and the first two tapes are largely in this upbeat mood, with it not getting dark and dramatic until the entering of Jerusalem on the third tape.Marchiano is the only one in the cast with an American accent, which at first sounds odd, especially since his voice has an uncanny resemblance to Kevin Costner's, particularly when speaking with force and emotion (perhaps they both hail from the same area of the country), but this initial reaction is soon forgotten as one gets engrossed in the film.Marchiano is an expressive actor, and so natural; he is hilarious in Ch. 7:3-5 (the speck in your brother's eye), and so moving in the parable of the wedding feast (Ch. 22:7-14), and 23:3-39, when Jesus speaks to the scribes and Pharisees. It's a powerful performance, nuanced and full of insight, and will inspire the mind and feed the soul.Taken from the New International Version, the language is contemporary, and is understandable to all, making it an excellent introduction to the Bible for children.Vol. One, Chapters 1:1-9:1; 58 minutes.Vol. Two, Chapters 9:2-14:36; 58 minutes.Vol. Three, Chapters 15:1-23:39; 70 minutes.Vol. Four, Chapters 24:1-28:20; 64 minutes.",5,the power of The Word,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",0.4023

It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies.

13,A2NA99PH6OPMG3,718000315,D. Dickey,"[0, 0]","Touted as the movie showing the &#34;joyful&#34; Jesus, this does not disappoint. In its novel approach of using only the words of the New International Version's Gospel of Matthew, this movie captures a rarely seen essence of Jesus, that of the caring, loving, charismatic, and encouraging Savior. Bruce Marchiano performs the role of the Christ brilliantly, avoiding the unfortunate stereotypes given by previous actors who showed Jesus as solemn, unsmiling, pious, and even condescending. In the scene of Jesus walking on the water during a storm, he beckens Peter to walk from the boat to him. Peter does, but upon seeing the waves, he becomes scared, begins sinking, and cries out to Jesus. The written text, &#34;Oh, you of little faith! Why did you doubt?&#34;, makes it sound as if Jesus is berating Peter. However, in this portrayal, Jesus (Marchiano) pulls Peter to him, laughs and hugs him as he says this, as he would to a kid brother who fumbled a football. No anger or judgement, just encouragement as he then walks Peter to the boat.The movie is filled with examples of Jesus being human, laughing with his friends, discussing matters of faith and helping those in need, crying with joy over triumphs, and with sadness over loss. Considerably less graphic in its depiction of the crucifixion than The Passion of Christ, this movie conveys the pain and horror in a manner that could leave some viewers a little queasy. It is as realistic portrayal of Jesus and his times as I've seen, and one that truly shows that this was the Son of God. The supporting cast, cinematography and the musical score make this a most engaging production.It is four hours long, and while it can make for a great Saturday afternoon of video, it can be intense enough to want to break it up into two or three viewing sessions. &#34;Matthew&#34; is also well suited to Bible studies for adults and teens.",5,Absolutely the finest motion picture of the life of Jesus ever!,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",0.264

The dialogue and narration are directly from the gospel of Matthew, like an audio Bible, which means that events that Matthew didn't write about aren't shown. The costumes, settings, and actions attempt to give a visual idea of what it all might have looked like.I liked that the actors played Jesus and the disciples like real people would act. The actor played Jesus as laughing and joyful when someone is healed, sad when people reject His message, playful when teaching (as some of his teachings contain humor!), and serious when appropriate. This is the type of Jesus that would draw crowds--the Jesus I know from the Bible. It's not perfect, but I really enjoyed watching it.

18,ASK27JHZK7VHF,718000315,Edward M. Curtis,"[1, 2]","I have both this production and the Campus Crusade for Christ &quot;Jesus&quot; film. I believe this is the superior effort. Bruce Marchiano gives a passionate performance as Jesus, and conveys a variety of moods effectively. He does a good job of showing Jesus' humanity, better I think than the Crusade film.Matthew's one major weakness is also, oddly, one of its strengths - the length. In order to get every verse of the Gospel of Matthew on screen, this film runs for about 4 hours. It is commendable that the producers present the whole Gospel account; this gives a more detailed dramatization than the Crusade 'Jesus' film, which tried to present the entire Gospel of Luke in 2 hours. However this also means that the narrative in 'Matthew' bogs down in places, and it seems like it takes forever to get to the film's emotional payoff, the Crucifixion and Resurrection. Also, there are a couple of montages intercutting between Matthew as an old man and scenes from Jesus' day that don't seem to have much connection to the words that are being spoken by Richard Kiley. (The film's central narrative device is that Kiley, as old Matthew, dictates his Gospel account to scribes, and we see the events he is describing in flashback.)Nevertheless, if you're interested in Biblical epics, this is well worth having.DVD Technical note: On my JVC XV-M555 (3 disc changer), which I purchased in August 2000, disc 2 has picture breakup at the start of chapter 38 (which corresponds to the start of chapter 24 in the Gospel text). This may have to do with some minor scratches I observed on the underside; or it may be an authoring problem.

It is simply acted out word for word, and you can see the reference at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. I have personally watched several hundred people view this video, and I can attest that about a quarter of the audience likes to keep their Bibles open so they can follow along (at least occasionally).

The acting is horrible horrible horrible and awful after that.Bruce Marchiano treats the role of Jesus like Jesus was an entertainer on a stage or a stand up comedian, not actually relating to people. After performing some miracles, he looks as if he is about to yell Ta Da!!!! or maybe thrust his hands in the air and run around the field like he just scored a touchdown or something. When he delivers his lines, he pauses at really awkward moments, as if he is trying to remember his lines, and rapid fire delivers them at other times when he should pause. He whispers to the Jewish authorities 'you brood of vipers' and you hypocrites and smiles when he's chastising the towns for not repenting in which he did his miracles. He actually delivers some sermons with his hand on his hip, and other times dumps water on an onlooker. They have him joyfully smiling to the point of his voice breaking in 16:23 when he says to Peter get behind me Satan and throughout 16:26 - 28 during the What profits a man if he loses his soul speech while his disciples are straightfaced and somber. Ugh. HORRIBLE ACTING.The way the movie cuts between first and 3rd persons in the form of an older Matthew narrating the story to his children and Jesus acting it out...it's just plain awkward timing a lot of the time. The narration during the acting out of Jesus: He said, They said etc is also distracting because it doesn't flow with the scene. The musical soundtrack is really bad too.My conclusion is that this movie did not enhance my understanding of the Gospel in any way. I actually felt repulsed and did not trust the words coming out of this portrayal of Jesus due the horrible acting. I've tried to watch this a couple of times, and each time I just couldn't wait until it was over and I LOVE Matthew's Gospel! This is so different from the Gospel of John video from the same makers. It is way better to read this Gospel than view it here.",2,Horrible acting and direction,1230336000,"12 27, 2008",-0.1248
38,A1SCD2NYTIAQTY,718000315,Mouldy Pilgrim,"[4, 8]","When I first saw this, I had took a double take and wondered if what I was watching was actually a serious production. It turned out to be so.Matthew: The Visual Bible is an attempt to bring the Bible to life by using the script from the NIV translation of Matthew alone. There are no added bits or license taken with the version of the Bible used. What you hear is the NIV translation with some pictures to go with it. Of course, the characters themselves speak the words that are attributed to them, so it is more than just some pastor reading the bible to cute pictures.Probably the first thing to be noticed is the location used. It looks remarkably un-Middle Eastern, right down to the rather Scottish looking disciple, (I believe that was Peter), and the blue eyed Jesus. Sometimes the acting left something to be desired, and there was often a moment when a group of us were literally reduced to tears of laughter.However, in this production's defence, it did manage to bring a more humorous interpretation to the figure of Jesus, making him seem more human and reachable. There are times when you can also see the anger and the frustration that he felt, but the accessible nature of Jesus is always there. This was something I found to be appealing about the whole thing, and compensated somewhat for the el cheapo short-cuts taken in other aspects.The Passion of the Christ this is not, and it does give some depth to the people we read about in the Bible. However, it is certainly not an epic production on the scale of The Ten Commandments. You might have a bit of a fit with a bunch of Americans dressed shabbily as first century Jews in Roman Judea.",3,Words Cannot Express,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",0.0918
39,A3CPX27XQ4BOKX,718000315,moviemusicbuff,"[7, 15]","I watched this Matthew DVD with eager expectation, since I really liked the Acts DVD set.The good points:It is word-for-word from the NIV version, thus the movie is very faithful to the Bible. The actors, for the most part, are fairly decent.The not-so-good points:a) The depiction of JesusI know that Jesus smiled and laughed and probably was not as serious as Robert Powell in Jesus of Nazareth, but Bruce's depiction was a little bit too much. Yes, Jesus was happy but sometimes he was serious, angry, and disappointed. He most likely didn't walk around with a huge grin on his face all the time. Bruce's Jesus was continuously gleefully happy and whenever he talked to people, he always touched them on the face or hugged them. After watching this movie for an hour, I felt somewhat annoyed or irritated at this depiction of Jesus. It was distracting to me.b) Scenes of narration by Matthew which interrupts the flow of the movieRichard Kiel's narration is great but often times, his narration scenes break up the flow of the movie. There would be scenes of Jesus talking to his disciples and then it changes to Richard Kiel playing Matthew as he talks to his family, and then back to Jesus & the disciples. This was also pretty distracting. At other times, I wanted certain scenes to be shown where Jesus would be talking to his disciples (i.e. Matthew 24 -- the Olivet discourse), but what we get instead is Matthew narrating the text in a house to his family members.Some of the background to the scenes didn't make too much sense. When Jesus tells some of his parables, the scenes show Jesus soaking by the river with the disciples. Where did they think of that as a backdrop? It would be much better to have Jesus speak to the disciples sitting down.c) Mary the mother of Jesus at the endWhen Mary cries over Jesus's dead body, she has a sizeable nasal dripping coming out of her nose. This was pretty distracting, to say the least!As you can tell, I was somewhat disappointed by this movie. It could have been much better.I highly recommend The Gospel of John instead of this one. The actor (Henry Ian Cusick) and narrator (Christopher Plummer) are excellent and the movie is expertly directed by Philip Saville; it flows much better as a film than this one of Matthew.",3,Sincere effort but a bit over the top performance by Bruce,1106956800,"01 29, 2005",0.1479

41,A2O9S8NH65S8UM,718000315,open ears,"[17, 18]","This was an experience rather than just a great movie for me....I have very often wished I were There at that time, and have endlessly envied the people who saw and heard Jesus.I did not expect that Matthew would bring me as close as possible to my wish. The director's and Bruce Marchiano's 'vision' and understanding of who Jesus really was, their attention to His words about his joy produced a wonderful movie.I think that for people to follow Jesus leaving their life behind in a moment, He must have been a very warm, friendly, caring man, a young, fit, tanned carpenter who walked miles in the sun to get around. Bruce Marchiano did an incredible job showing us that. We have been so conditioned to avoid affection and touching people, that many of us think that's the way human beings should act with each other.Yet in the Middle East, it is customary to this day for men to walk with their male friends with their arms around each other's shoulders!!!Jesus was Love above all, divine Love in human form; could not have been affected by human norms-he must have been a man with the purest, most genuine behavior, something we, today, have to think HARD in order to imagine (sadly!).On the other hand, Jesus telling off the Pharisees is a gut-wrenching scene, extremely powerful and emotional. I even doubt Bruce Marchiano was acting the sorrow and anger of it. After all, he's devoted his life to working for God after the making of Matthew, which forced him to study the Bible intensely.This movie kept me on the sofa for the entire 4 hours-often in tears, often with an unbearable feeling of being there, then, not as a spectator, but as a participant .For the first time, Jesus was truly the real focus of the movie, and his parables, sharp intellect, dialectic skill worthy of a great lawyer, and teaching, with Bruce Marchiano's excellent delivery, became so easily understood. No Hollywood excesses and distractions here.Beautiful cinematography, incredibly realistic landscapes, costumes, gorgeous-just gorgeous music....nothing was missing from this film. Well....the Hollywood excess was missing, and it was not needed.I have no idea why Jesus has been portrayed as rather aloof and serious, as if always burdened until Matthew, but I just feel it's been inaccurate. Jesus was fully a Jewish man in his time on Earth, who laughed and loved and was not ashamed to cry in public-as it is documented in the gospels. He was dealing with simple, uneducated people-their following Him without food for 2-3 days to hear Him, and loving him, tells me that He related to them on their level.I watch all of the movie or part of it at least once a week, and it never gets old.I know from Bruce Marchiano's website that he wants to fund strictly from donations, not banks, another word-for-word movie,The Gospel according to John, and I hope he -or rather, we- accomplishes it soon-in fact I can't wait. In the years that have passed since Matthew his love, knowledge, and understanding of Jesus has grown a lot, so I think he'll bring us an even more inspired movie.",5,The best of all movies about Jesus so far,1144368000,"04 7, 2006",0.4872

44,A2SJ58PICEF67,718000315,Robert K. Fries,"[2, 5]","My wife and I both watched this new version of the gospel of Jesus Christ according to Matthew. We've watched many professional productions of Biblical stories and they cannot be seriously commented on without deep consideration. A simple review in my opinion, is based on a person's visual and emotional perceptions of the presentation, kind of how we rate everyday movies and TV shows. We watch it once, with a possibility of watching it again IF, we liked it. If we don't like it, my wife and/or I will often shut it off and send it back to the rental service unwatched. If we DO like, a lot, we will rent it again and again or, buy 1 or more copies for ourselves and others. When it comes to SERIOUS productions that AFFECT OUR LIVES like Biblical presentations there is a great deal more involved than if we simply LIKE IT or not.Do the actors fit the part as we expect, and/or the Bible clearly portrays them?Is there a lot of un-Biblical filler where the Bible has been silent, in either WORDS or ACTIVITIES?Do we detect an overshadowing influence or tendency to modify the clear teachings of Biblical scripture?To my mind, anything that we take as seriously as Biblical FACT in life MUST pass rigorous tests as compared with Biblical content before any judgement involving sharing the presentation is concerned.Concerning This version of THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW, I would have to say that my wife and I both had immediate and similar responses to both the actor portraying Jesus AND those portraying His disciples. This version is certainly a DEPARTURE from the NORM. I recommend a serious viewing of the presentation as I might JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR or GODSPELL. There is much that can be learned by a well read Bible student from viewing a presentation of Jesus which is DIFFERENT THAN THE TRADITIONAL PORTRAYAL. The downside is that this portrayal is different enough that it could actually end up being a BE TRAYAL to viewers who are not already grounded by KNOWING the voice of the CHIEF SHEPHERD.So, I would NOT recomment it to unbelievers or people seeking the ONE WHO HOLDS THE KEYS OF LIFE AN DEATH, Jesus Christ.RK Fries",3,Another view's Impact,1258934400,"11 23, 2009",0.1709
