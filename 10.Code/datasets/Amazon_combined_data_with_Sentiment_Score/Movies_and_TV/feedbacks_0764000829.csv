However the blowtorch isn't that big a player in the movie. This is your typical Vietnam vet revenge story ad nauseum. Vet Ginty seeks revenge on the creeps who ripped up his best friend with a clawhammer (Steve James- who briefly adds &quot;life&quot; to the movie). There are some hilariously bad gore scenes, including the decapitation in the opening scene which has to be seen to be believed, and how could I forget the sequence with the meat grinder? I'd advise you not to eat a hamburger while watching this movie. Worst of all though is the godawful country-western song which plays during the opening credits.

2,A3LQU8CWUYFMJH,764000829,Blu Review Obscura,"[26, 26]","The Exterminator Blu-ray ReviewDistributor : Synapse Films (US)For a movie that contains such visual delights as beatings, burning, beheading, forced prostitution and the painfully slow decent of another unfortunate victim into a working meat grinder, it is no wonder that the The Exterminator has had its share of controversy over the years.Robert Ginty plays an ordinary every day guy who after a particularly nasty attack on his best friend, sets about dispatching the criminal element of 1980's New York in ways which would give even Jigsaw nightmares. Highlights of vengeance include extreme facial surgery involving a group of hungry rats, poison tipped bullets and the previous mentioned incident where the local gangster is quite literally turned into a string of sausages. Even the family dog doesn't escape unharmed in this one folks!With the varying amounts of violence on display, it is no wonder that the film has suffered numerous cuts over the years, however it is the gritty realism of the film itself rather than any one particular gore scene which ultimately unnerves the viewer and actually makes for a pretty good story beneath all of the carnage.Released on Blu-ray by Synapse Films on a region free disc, the film is presented in its fully uncut directors print which features all of the gore excised from previous releases. Synapse have gone to town on this release and have invested in a brand new 2k scan from the original materials which has produced a quality 1080p 1.78:1 transfer of the film that put simply is stunning. Detail is sharper than ever before with colours and black levels appearing really well defined. Film grain is rightfully present throughout the picture which only enhances the overall atmosphere and for anyone who is used to watching previous versions of the movie, this new print will be a revelation.Audio tracks are available in a choice of DTS Mono and original restored Stereo mixes, both of which are trouble free and sound clear and well balanced. Admittedly the low budget roots of the film will ensure that the soundtrack will never compete with the latest modern day blockbusters, however there really is nothing to complain about here, with both dialogue and action scenes being clean and well represented.Extras wise there is not a great deal available in this package, however what is here is largely very good. Firstly there is an informative commentary track by the films director which covers every conceivable angle relating to the films production, locations, release and even his personal views on the films sequel. As far as commentaries go this really is one of the better ones and fans of the film will find plenty of interest. Rounding this off, there are the usual theatrical trailers and some TV spots which also make a nice addition. Although a couple of extra documentaries would have been most welcome, the excellent commentary track more than makes up for any shortfall.All things considered, this Blu-ray release should be considered as a must buy purchase for fans of the film. Casual viewers will also find plenty to like and as a classic example of 1980's exploitation movie making, the film still has plenty to offer. With a UK Blu-ray release coming soon from Arrow Video which is said to use the same quality transfer and contain additional extra features, there is a clear choice to import this US release or wait until November for the UK disc. Worth noting however is that the Arrow release contains an altogether different audio commentary track with the films producer and at this time it remains unconfirmed whether the original Stereo soundtrack option will be present on their release. For real fans of the film or for people who remain undecided there is of course always the option of a double purchase.One things for certain The Exterminator has never looked or sounded better, further proving that older low budget films really can have a new lease of life on Blu-ray.If You're Lying.....I'll Be Back!BLU REVIEW OBSCURA - for reviews of the less mainstream releases find us on Facebook or at blureviewobscura .yolasite .com",4,Blu Review 46 - The Exterminator,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",0.2861

There are several scratches or lines that go across the whole picture during a couple of frames that last a good while before clearing up. There is grain and fuzziness throughout the movie, but does look better than previous releases of this movie.Overall this release is a little disappointing.

It has all the ingredients one would expect for film of this nature: ultra-violence,sleaze,lack of and disregard for political correctness,raw,independent guerrilla film-making feel, evocative locations of an era long extinct etc.Fast-paced, despite some shoddy editing and a pointless romantic sub-plot with a detective and his GF(the film's only real flaws IMO). Big on action,just the opening sequence alone will have the viewer hooked. Some very creative kills, including a kill with a meat-grinder and when a prostitute gets tortured with a soldering-iron(mostly off-camera, but implied enough that you get the point and disturbing). Some great explosions despite the budgetary constraints. An authentic realism and feel to the story. Very un-P.C.(a big plus for some), back in the day when you could make a movie without social and political pressure to tow a certain ideological party line. And no preaching or social redeeming crap. Love it! Enough brutal violence and some excellent bloodshed to satisfy genre fans.In the past, most copies were the censored theatrical version. Now,the cuts only amount to about 40 seconds or so(mostly the decaptation at the opening Vietnam sequence and the meat-grinder kill), but it's still nice to have it uncut,just out of principle alone. When Anchor bay got it, they released it uncut for the first time, on VHS and DVD,not a great transfer. Then came the awful Tango DVD,still uncut,and widescreen,but non-anamorphic,audio problems,shoddy transfer and no menu!! Now we can toss that copy away and forget it existed because....Synapse has done an excellent job here. The picture has never looked better, grain where there should be but crisp,clean sharp fully remastered picture, better even than the theatrical run probably!! In glorious anamorphic 1.78, with original mono and stereo tracks. Never looked better, as far as I'm concerned.Extras are very light, but the audio commentary is excellent. Very informative and fun to listen to. A lot of good info and detail presented, everything from shooting to MPAA problems to the film's cult classic status. One of the best commentaries of it's kind.

13,A1OYNQNK3ZM5QB,764000829,J. Meeley,"[0, 0]","Something that can be found in all the best grindhouse films, is their ability to tap into the most primal of human emotions. The rawness of the film style brings a gritty realism to the proceeding. That is certainly true in the case of the vengeance-fueled fantasy that is &#34;The Exterminator!&#34; Former vet, John Eastland (played very effectively by Robert Ginty), finds life in New York City is even more savage than the jungles of Vietnam, after the near-fatal assault of his best friend causes him to wage his own personal war on the criminal element of the city. Of course, such actions will not go unnoticed.Right from the start, writer/director James Glickenhaus lets you know just what you are in for with this film, as it begins with a horrific flashback to Eastland's time in 'Nam and sets the tone of the violent displays that will soon follow it. While the special effects are not what one would call &#34;high quality,&#34; the sheer brutality of what is shown (and often what is not shown) adds a degree of realism that most big budget special effects extravaganzas never could hope to achieve. The beheading scene during the wartime flashback (done masterfully by special effect artist Stan Winston), for example, perfectly illustrates what I mean. It's a gripping moment, due to the harshness and savage way it is presented. Most of the violence is presented in this fashion and it gives the film an edge over many of the like-minded ones that were being produced at the time. They also did a very good job of portraying New York City in the late 70's. The feeling of urban decay, filth, and human misery is almost palpable. Quite simply, you might almost feel the need to bathe after watching this film.As far as the story goes, it's pretty straight-forward. Just your typical revenge style fantasy stuff, which was like a cottage industry back then. There are some bits about the political climate of the time woven into things, as Eastland's actions are not taken well by political figures, who feel his war on crime makes them look inept and weak. But while the politics are in the background, they never really dominate the story. Instead, the focus is kept on Eastland's private war. Most of the performances range from adequate to banal, but then one doesn't watch this kind of cinema expecting Oscar-worthy acting. Robert Ginty was never really a great actor, with this film being his biggest claim to fame, but he truly brought out a great performance here. You can understand and relate to him and why he's doing what he is. I also liked the role of the cop out to stop him (played solidly by Christopher George). However, the romance he strikes up with a nurse (played by Samantha Eggar) doesn't really fit in with the rest of the tone of the film. As a result, it feels tacked on and unnecessary, only serving to take time away from getting more insights into Ginty's character. The ending of the film is, without question, not your typical Hollywood kind and the film only benefits from that.While many might see &#34;The Exterminator&#34; as just a fairly typical entry into this sub-genre of film, I think some of the smaller bits within it shine through enough that it stands out from most fare of this nature. Within the realm of grindhouse flicks, this one is certainly one of the better ones out there. The rawness and grit of the setting and the downtroddened feeling in the performances, gives the film a legitimacy few others of it's kind ever have.

I will say The Exterminator was, and is a blueprint for all hollywood vigilante type films after 1980, that even Titanic 1997 director James Cameron has seen and took notice of. People have complained about a properer release of The Exterminator. I agree, I wish this 1998 Anchor Bay release had some extra features, interviews, Director comments and of course Exterminator Trailers. This film is presented in its original widescreen 1:85:1. I think the film transfer of this film to dvd is excellent and again another fine Anchor Bay release. The roof scene with the pigeons you do see some dust lines, but that was because the of this films low budget. Anchor Bay did the best film tranfer of this limited film quality. Yeah!! I know this is a Death Wish ripoff,(Death Wish,Death Wish 2, but beleive me The Exterminator has its shining moments. The music by Joe Renzetti is very realistically inspiring and captures the mood of the film well. The most realistic part was when The Exterminator John Eastland picks up a prostitute and brings her to a hotel. As the prostitute removes her blouse John notices that her breasts have been burned. When John questions her about what happened to her, she is very defensive at first, than as she explains to John that she was burned with a soddering iron, Joe Renzettis somber music score plays in the background, you really feel the womans pain, This scene with the acting, along with the music score really got to my heart. The Exterminator gets ripped for being a cheap Death Wish knock off but to me with its brutal scenes capture the crime ridden streets of New York in 1979-1980. Director James Glickenhause saw this problem and put this into The Exterminator. Terms like Chicken House were real and did exists at that time and unfortunatly still do into the 21st century. Glickenhause did not sugar coat anything and laid reality all out in The Exterminator. Glickenhause's message was If the authorities can't control these sadistic criminals, than maybe a vietnam veteran that is somewhat off keel, can rid the New York streets of these animals. Exterminator John Eastland even undermineded the Goverment and all the corrupt New York Politicians, another Glickenhause message about corrupted politicians just letting these criminals ruin and control the honest persons lifestyle. The Exterminator might be dated and considered a Death Wish ripoff, to me I think The Exterminator is a very realistic film that captures the seedy crime ridden streets of a 1979-1980 New York. The acting is brilliant for a film of this genre. I really began to like this guy John Eastland, and how he beleived one man can make a difference even though it was illegal. Actor Robert Ginty who plays Eastland was not a georgeous Chippendale model but an average looking joe like anybody else, I guess that is why this guy Eastland appealed to me. James Glickenhause clearly researched this film as far as criminal activity in the streets of New York at this time. The Exterminator is a true all around great vigilante film, in my opinion the best of all of them, Yes! even the Death Wish Films, which I do like. People will knock The Exterminator believe me it is a well thought out film by director James Glickenhause. You may rip The Exterminator for being a Death Wish ripoff or its really low budget, but I will say it definintly is a blueprint for all vigilante type films after 1980. Again a nice remastered film transfer by the people at Anchor Bay...........",5,THE CRIME RIDDEN STREETS OF NEW YORK CITY CIRCA 1979-1980.

23,A3A81ZZ4ANLZ8G,764000829,The Critic Movie Maniac,"[2, 2]","The 2005 video release of The Exterminator the Digitally Remastered Director's Cut from Tango Entertainment is probably the best this film will ever look unless a major studio re-release's it. The print from Tango is decent but still contains debris, scratches and other imperfections despite other reviewers claiming its near perfect. They could have done a little more with the sound levels because the sound does fluctuate up and down throughout the movie.This version is a bare bones release from Tango Entertainment. There aren't any bonus features, commentaries or extras at all. Overall this film is four star entertainment for fans of the genre and hopefully one of the big studios will give this film the DVD release it truly deserves. I'd love to see a two disc 30th Anniversary release filled with tons of extras. Having said that, I haven't seen the Exterminator since I was a teenager and somehow the opening scene has stuck with me for 28 years.The Exterminator is a low budget action film filled with scenes of pure brutality and violence. Fans of this 1980 classic revenge film will be sad to learn that the Director's Cut DVD is the rated (R) version and not the uncensored version with all the blood and violence that made this film so memorable. Former Vietnam vet John Eastland played by (Robert Ginty) is driven to revenge when his best friend and Vietnam buddy is brutally beaten by a New York street gang and left to die. After seeing his friend lying helpless in the hospital Eastland declares war on the gang who savagely beat his friend and any other lowlife street punk or criminal he can get his hands on. Soon the revenge and killing become so easy for John Eastland he realizes that the Gangs of New York, its Police force as well as the C.I.A are all out to get him.Can John Eastland continue to carry out his one man brand of justice or will the Exterminator's flame finally be snuffed out? You'll have to buy you're own copy to see how it ends. All we need now is a DVD release of the Exterminator 2 and John Eastland's Flamethrowing vigilante justice will finally be complete.",4,"IF YOU'RE LYING TO ME, I'LL BE BACK!",1210377600,"05 10, 2008",-0.001

He doesn't get top billing, but Robert Ginty is clearly the center of attention, in this tale of revenge, as a former soldier employs his fighting skills in a new arena. Not the toughest or most charismatic guy around, Ginty might appear an unlikely choice for such a gritty tale, but he brings a certain sense of realism to the role, and is just a fun guy to watch in action.After having served together in Viet Nam, army buddies John Eastland (Ginty) and Michael Jefferson (Steve James), return to civilian life. Working at a food warehouse in NYC, they have a fight with three men trying to steal beer. The punks, who are members of a gang called the Ghetto Ghouls, later ambush Jefferson, and do permanent damage to his spine.Without any hesitation, Eastland is on a quest for retribution. He tracks down the men, blasts one with an M-16, and leaves the other two to be ravaged by rats. Looking to get some money for Jefferson's family, Eastland next targets a mob leader, who has extorted money from workers like Jefferson. The sensational crimes, are investigated by a police detective named Dalton (Christopher George,The Rat Patrol), who tries to find a clue, in the carnage that The Exterminator leaves behind. The CIA is also involved, and have their own twisted agenda. When Dalton closes in on Eastland, the Government steps in to close the books on the Exterminator.At the time, Robert Ginty (1948-2009) was mostly known for his work in TV, likeThe Black Sheep Squadron, and The Paper Chase, but he's quite good here, playing a man that is compassionate, yet hardened to violence. The Exterminator works efficiently, without a lot of emotion, as events play out without a lot of pretense. The story doesn't always flow smoothly, the production is a little unpolished, and the ending somewhat forced, but The Exterminator is still a very enjoyable revenge flick.Most of the material restored in the 104 minute unrated director's cut, are apparently action or gore related. A gruesome burned corpse that appears briefly, is really nicely done. As is the war footage that opens the film, which features a decapitation, and a spectacular fall. Although the Bluray is probably the best the film will ever look, it is pretty grainy in a number of places. Robert Ginty has unfortunately passed away, but director James Glickenhaus provides a thoughtful and informative commentary, that puts the film in some context.The success of The Exterminator would result in a sequel, The Exterminator 2 (1984) with Ginty reprising his role. The film is included in theAction Packed Marathona four film collection. The sequel has some strange aspects, but the level of violence is amplified, and the flame thrower that is a part of the Exterminator's promotional campaign, is more prominently featured.",4,"robert ginty battles the ghetto ghouls, in the exterminator...",1376784000,"08 18, 2013",0.0383
