Soon after it begins, the unsuspecting moviegoers, like the characters in the film, start turning into flesh-hungry zombies. It all sounds promising enough, but that's where the originality ends. The audience inexplicably finds itself trapped inside the theater and the rest of the movie is pure formula: a group of anonymous, one-dimensional characters is picked off one by one by the zombies, only to become zombies themselves, who (you guessed it) pick off the remaining anonymous, one-dimensional characters. Of course, Bava knows that it's all about the gore and, on that score at least, Demons really delivers. There's enough gut munching, eye gouging and scalp tearing to satisfy even the most hardened gorehound, and the special effects (courtesy of Argento regular Sergio Stivaletti) are about as good as they come. Thirty-something types will also appreciate the early `80s heavy-metal soundtrack, which features M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e (Save Our Souls) and Accept (Fast as a Shark), among others.Two and a half stars out of five.",2,"Great gore effects, but otherwise unremarkable zombie fare",1081036800,"04 4, 2004",0.2345

Fueled by grotesque make-up, shocking special effects, and a super-charged soundtrack by Italian rockers Goblin, DEMONS is a fast-paced thrill ride that is jam-packed with flesh-eating ghouls and mindless madness! The demons are unleashed upon an unsuspecting theater audience when the events occurring on-screen bleed into reality and possess the movie-goers. Much of the film's success can be attributed to Sergio Stivaletti's terrifying monster designs, which come complete with glowing yellow eyes, razor-sharp claws and fangs, and festering boils. As if the creatures were not enough, DEMONS also offers tons of gooey splatter effects, drowning the theater floor in popcorn, blood, and guts. With Italian master Dario Argento on hand to oversee the production and Bava behind the camera, DEMONS proves to be much more than just another exploitative gore shocker. It is shot with an intelligent structure and composition to maximize the scares, and while it may be light on character and dialog, the people appearing on screen are always entertaining and never incompetent.

11,A37OOQQLMMKYR8,764005707,Dave. K,"[0, 0]","By the time Demons was released Italian horror cinema was heading towards the end of its amazing run. While there were still classics coming out of Italy it seemed to be less frequent as it once was. I enjoyed Demons, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed by it simply for the talent that was involved. By no means would I say Demons is a bad movie. It's a splatter flick and nothing more. It does deliver in some areas, but lacks in others.The screenplay was written by Dario Argento, Lamberto Bava, Franco Ferrini and Dardano Sacchetti as well as also being produced by Dario Argento. The script lacks and none of the characters have much depth. Simply put almost all of them serve to purpose, but to add to the body count. That is very common in the horror genre, but I think they over-did it with all the characters. There were just too many to keep track of. With Dario Argento and Dardano Sacchetti involved I guess I just expected a lot more. Sacchetti wrote or co-wrote many cult classics in the 70s and 80s with his most notable movies being made with Lucio Fulci.Personally I was never really the biggest fan of Lamberto Bava; while he has made some enjoyable flicks he has also made some bad flicks. His career seems to be very hit or miss and with Demons it's a little bit of both. Demons takes a little while to get going, but once it does Demons does have a pretty good run before running out of gas despite only being about 90-minutes. The biggest problem as I stated earlier is just too many characters. After a while seeing them run away from Demons gets a little tiring.People often confuse demonic flicks with zombie flicks; while they might follow a similar structure they are also very different as well. Even though Demons is a demonic flick it does follow the basic concept of a zombie movie. It seems to me to almost be sort of a demon version of Night of the Living Dead structure wise. I always like movies where the characters are isolated and have no way of getting to safety. The main characters are trapped in a movie theater with no way out.Problem is despite that Demons lacks any real tension. I never really felt that there was any suspense or tension. Maybe that wasn't the point, but running away from demons just becomes tiring. The setting was perfect, but I just never felt the isolation. Lamberto Bava is able though to create some really excellent murder scenes, but unable to bring much suspense or tension. The first half of Demons can be quite gory. We have throats being ripped a part, eyes being pulled out; some really great stuff to be found.The 2nd half though begins to slump at times; it's pretty much a repeat of the first half only this time less gore. We might see the demons lunge, but there is a cutaway. Demons ripping at people, but we don't get to see the good stuff. The final act has a guy on a motorcycle with a sword and surrounded by demons and I was expecting some major carnage, but while there is action there obviously, it didn't really deliver the gore. Demons is a splatter flick and I just felt there wasn't enough splatter.Despite the flaws Demons was a fun movie and something I would watch again, but I just felt the movie could have been a little better.

So here it is horror fans!!!, one of the true real classic of horror!!! Just as good as ANGUISH !!..maybe a bit more.....Cheryl and Kathy decides they wanna do something different for a change, instead of going to class they decide to go see this new movie at a local theatre, Cheryl was given 2 tickets earlier in the subway by a strange masked man (which is none other than director Michele Soavi!!!) So Cheryl and Kathy makes their way to the theatre and get ready for the movie, they are soon join by 2 other guys who think they can maybe be useful in case the girls get scared and decide to sit besides them.The movie that starts on the screen is about a group of teenagers having nothing better to do than inspect an old catacombs where they soon discover, has the actual remains (or what's left of it) of NOSTRADAMUS, they find a mask and a book...in the books it says that one of Nostradamus predictions was that the demons would walk the earth again someday.....then someone actually tries the mask to scare the other girls inside and get scratched by it as he's removing it.....that triggers something in the audience in the theatre as one of the girl watching the movie with friends did the exact same thing with a similar mask and also got cut!.........i really can't say more....sorry....At this point in the movie, you are in for a hell of a ride!!!! Without wanting to give away the punch here, you'll find out that there is a lot of similarity between the movie the audience is watching and whats actually really happening in the theatre....... Dario is really at his best here with gruesome effects, lots of gore, awesome special effects and his usual signature : strong use of colour with perfect cinematography and heavy metal music!!!! The acting is good, some would maybe say a little cheesy sometimes but nothing scary..... there's lots of surprises in this movie too!!!So overall if you like horror, more specifically Italian horror, you should give this one a try!!! You won't be dispointed!! I Also have to add that if you like the concept of this film you should definitely try ANGUISH as well!!!

I will avoid re-telling the plot, that won't help you (read the amazon synopsis). Here's a list of the good, the bad and the so-so that I found in DemonsGOOD-Clever premise. The idea of starting a Demon plague with a free movie showing is pretty unique. I had no trouble buying into this idea and the way it was set up was pretty convincing.-Some good special effects. Given it's pre-CG technology, several of the effects were actually ambitious and well executed.-Some pretty disgusting gore and spew. Enough said.-Cinematography, editing, lighting, etc. are often very proffesional.-The actors did a fair job with the script. This is an Italien horror film from the 80s after all. This film was actually shot in english (and then dubbed). Strangely, the guy who plays the mack-daddy was one of the few who spoke no english at all.-Plenty of surprizes and unexpected events. I own about 70 horror films yet I can't believe some of the stuff I fell for.BAD-Some bad special effects. For every good animatronic, there are 5 bad, rubbery looking fake skin effects.-Some really overdone gore. I like clever gore in all the right places. This had gore that was done too slowly and too exploitative to be convincing. I guess they were going for the big grossout. Do you like bright green spew(you'd better)? It was not that fun sometimes.-Many killings by grabbing of the throat and shaking. Wow.-The film shown in the theater was far more disturbing than Demons itself. I am actually thankful for that because the violence in the fake movie was too much for even me.-Some really poor editing and camera work. Yea, I said this work was often very professional. Problem is, many times it was not. Rather clunky and tacky in spots.-A lot of really bad acting/voice-overs. Yea, I know; fair job with the script. Unfortunately the script had some very stupid moments. Also not all the actors were good.SO-SO-They didn't want to make another zombie film... ...so they made something just like one but with glowing eyes, claws and huge fangs. Other than that, it's a lot like a zombie film.-The settings of this film were not so creepy. It's actually a pretty nice theater and exudes little sense of dread. Still ok though.-Some of the better sequences are hard to swallow. Though fun or enjoyable, they could have had better execution.-Goofy 80s music (mostly American). From Billy Idol to Rick Springfield and the Scorpions, you get a dated cross section of tracks.-The over-all product. When you add it all up, it's an entertaining but uneven film.THE DVD-Good quality picture and sound (under the circumstances).-Little extras: one Trailer, very short behind the scenes film, and some pretty good commentary which is at worst, translated to english by a journalist (who asked good questions) who sat with Bava and his special effects guy.-printed insert (rare these days) and an image on the disk.So, given all of the above, you really should be a gore/horror fan if you want to see or buy this. There are few other qualities (i.e. funny moments, deep plot, clever characters) that would make this film fun for you. I might watch this once a year around Halloween.

Valero Eterno,"[7, 11]","Being a big fan of Italian horror- Argento, Soavi, Fulci, I decided to give the Demons series a try due to the fact that Argento's name is stamped on it. First things first, Argento did not direct this, Lamberto Bava did. Which helps in explaining the below average standard of this film.The story deals with several people attending a free screening of a horror film in some mysterious theatre in Germany. One of the patrons foolishly tries on a mask that's on display inside the theatre and is accidentally wounded by it - it gives her a tiny scratch. She soon discovers that the wound becomes infected with puss and before you know it she becomes a murderous demon. The theatre patrons- who are somehow unexpectedly locked in, are soon infected, one by one. Chaos and bloodshed follow as the few remaining survivors scramble to try to escape the slimy green monsters.I have to frankly admit that I originally liked the idea of this film. Since zombie-living dead movies have been done to death, this demons premise is rather original and a refreshing change or should I say it would have been if it was better done. The entire film is a sloppy mess. You do get some interesting transformation scenes but for the most part the whole film makes no sense, has no scare logic, is very poorly constructed and executed. It's an incoherent mess. At least the zombies in zombie flicks kill for a reason, they need to eat and us humans are what they like best. The mosters here just go around scratching, biting and pulling the hair off people for no apparent reason. There is no reason for their madness. They're just annoying, unintelligent killing machines with green faces and very long nails. Despite the tremendous amount of slaughter displayed, it's all done jokingly. The demons themselves have a constant grin on their slimy faces which renders them laughable and pathetic. There is a rather amusing scene involving a demon scratching it's way out of a woman's back and as mentioned previously, some transformation scenes are interesting enough but unfortunately, not interesting enough to raise the level of this below average horror film.If you can put up with 90 minutes of this type of brainlessness than go ahead and purchase this movie and judging by some of the rave reviews here, it has a lot of fans. For those who want something that's actually scary, well done and intelligent- look elsewhere. It's a shame Argento's name is forever linked to this mess.",1,"A Good/Bad movie?

The movie is dubbed, the acting is bad and there are continuity problems that are pretty funny. One scene, a girl has a pony tail and a second later she doesn't. There is another scene where a dead person has their eyes open and then the next time you see the person a moment later, the eyes have closed (not because they were supposed to, but an obvious blooper). The dub acting was so bad, whoever was talking for the black guy reminded me a lot of Robert Downey Jr.'s character on Tropic Thunder. Maybe it was him! The gore itself is not a splatter fest like the comment on the cover of the movie suggests. It is basically typical of what you would see on a zombie movie like Night of the Living Dead.

I'd say that the movie is overall ok, it is enjoyable and the demons look cool, but that is about as best as it gets.",3,"Kind of a let down, but still ok",1219363200,"08 22, 2008",-0.1078
22,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,764005707,General Zombie,"[1, 4]","Lamberto Bava's 'Demons' is a pretty amusing film, if certainly not a good one. It has two major flaws 1- It is heavily padded even at only 88 minutes 2- The demons aren't really very cool. Zombies are almost invariably cool, even if they aren't necessarily scary or whatever. The demons are just 'Evil Dead' demon knockoffs, but they lack their playfully sadistic personalities, which are largely what made them work. That, and they try and attack people with elongated fingernail-claws, which is also kinda lame, I think. They ain't too bad, but you need a really cool monster for a monster movie to totally work.Still, the bigger problem with the film is the padding. For those who don't know, this film involves an outbreak of demonic horror in a movie theater. Prior to the outbreak however, we are forced to watch a surprisingly large amount of the film they are viewing. This film is extremely tedious, involving demonic possession and wandering around Nostradamus' tomb or something like that. Whatever it is, it's very boring, and startlingly repetitious.(One guys turns into a demon, and stabs one chick like 12 times, and then is ripping through a tent which also requires a good dozen slashes) Even worse, there is a subplot involving a number of, um, `punks', who just drive around in circles, snorting coke, for a number of scenes, until they eventually show up in the theater itself. This is especially senseless, as the punks don't do anything particularly interesting once they show up at the theater, and it's not as if there was a shortage victims within the theater.(They are used to show how the demons get out of the theater, but they coulda done that some other way, or just not explained it, as with most everything else that happens in this movie.) That, and there are a few too many scenes of people just standing around the theater, waiting to be ripped apart by demons.Still, there is a fair bit of demon action, and it's quite amusing. This film is plenty gory, though it isn't quite the gorefest I had been led to believe it was. Still, it delivers pretty well, with some plenty ripping and gouging and biting and all that. The grossest stuff would definitely be the demons transformations, as we are treated to large pustules which burst in a gout of neon pus, and a nice scene of some demon teeth growing in while forcing out some human teeth. There's also some sword action towards the end, as the demons get there comeuppance, though it's not as not delicious as one would hope or anticipate.There is no real characterization in this film, the acting/dubbing is about what you'd expect, and very little that happens is explained or makes any real sense. None of that matter all that much, but it deserves mentioning. There is a badass pimp dude, however. He's cool, and the only character of any interest. Visually, it has it's moments, but a movie theater is such a dull setting that they can't do all that much. They use lots of colored lighting, mostly red and blue, which is occasionally effective. Most of the time it just isn't all that interesting looking, however.Lotsa people like to whine about the music, but I think it fits the film pretty well. The actual score, by Simonetti from Goblin, is actually pretty weak, and easily the worst thing I've heard from him or Goblin as a whole. Too techno-y, and kinda annoying some of the time. The 80's pop/rock music they use is quite amusing, I think, particularly the old-school speed metal from Saxon and Accept, and Billy Idol's 'White Wedding'.(the only highlight of the time-wasting punk subplot) Some people complain that the music dates the film, but you know what other aspects of the film date it? All of them. So come up with another complaint, cause that one isn't valid.Yes, a fun movie. Check it out. If you like this you'll wanna check out `The Church', directed by Michele Soavi, who plays the mask dude in this film. Same basic setup, but in a church instead of a movie theater, naturally. Not as gory, but the effects are of much higher quality, the demons look better, and it's a lot more stylish overall, with better music and atmosphere. But, everyone else seems to like `Demons' more, so what do I know?",3,Amusing,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",0.1073

Better directed than any of Bava's other efforts and not so obtuse as many of Argento's films, DEMONS is a tight film, simple in concept, and genuinely terrifying.DEMONS revolves around a simple, standard zombie film plot; a group of people are trapped in an enclosed space with one who has become a zombie (or demon) and fight to stay alive as more and more of them are infected. This film effectively marries surprise scares (you know - when someone jumps out when you least expect it) and pure gore. There's plenty of the latter, being an Argento production, but the whole thing is so over the top that it's all in good fun.The film comes dangerously close to camp toward the end as the protagonists are blessed with a ridiculous turn of events that help them to avoid certain death, and it's hard for the viewer to keep from asking obvious questions like &quot;how did that helicopter crash through the roof intact?&quot; and &quot;how does he know how that helicopter operates?&quot; and &quot;where did the grappling hook and climbing gear come from?&quot;The end of the film, however, redeems any of its weaknesses as it keeps with the zombie film tradition of genuine hopelessness.

Bala Me Too Can Read,"[3, 4]","Nowadays Demons might be looked upon as merely an Italian cinematic curio or maybe just a typical - even derivative - example of the horror flicks that saturated the 1980s. But when it was first released in 1986, Demons upped the ante in the genre of the macabre, in terms of shock and gore. Unlike the slow zombies of George Romero's, these creatures were quick, but just as relentless. The sheer abandonment with which the demons went after their prey was stupefying to watch for a teenager like I was. There was an atmosphere of impending doom that was palpable throughout the film. I just saw Demons again for the first time in almost a decade, and while it's lost a bit of its luster for me, I still found it vastly entertaining. In my viewing of horror flicks, I don't look for detailed explanations, just a modicum of logic in an illogical genre. This film fits the bill. Demons is a mishmash of cheesy exposition, stilted acting, moist and grisly demonic transformations, and prerequisite monster chases and graphic disfigurements. Not too shabby. In fact, it's the perfect dvd to throw in when you have sarcastic friends over.The skimpy plot goes something like this: Complimentary tickets for a film screening are being passed out by a sinister man sporting a metallic half mask. Cut then to the dilapidated movie palace The Metropol and its smattering of movie goers. The screening begins and the movie being shown turns out to be a creepy horror flick about demons being raised and overrunning the world. As the movie unreels, scenes in the picture begin to parallel the goings-on in the audience. Soon enough, demons are ravaging and rending their frantic victims both on the screen and in the panic-filled theatre, which instantly becomes an abattoir.As I've said, in a by-the-number gorefest such as this, I tend to tolerate quite a bit. However, I do think the dead-end subplot of the coke-snorting hooligans who come in late to the picture is unnecessary. But it's a minor quibble. Demons was the first collaboration between director Lamberto Bava and producer Dario Argento, and their combined expertise in the genre turns Demons into a slick, sanguinary monster classic, laden with moments of sheer blood and guts carnage. The professionally-done monster effects, while not up to snuff with our current CGI stuff, were state of the art back then. The hard rock/heavy metal soundtrack also adds to the effluvium of menace and immediacy. For a horrificly good time, this film is wildly recommended!By the way, the special features offer a pretty interesting film audio commentary done in part by director Lamberto Bava, who speaks in both English and Italian.

Three demons on the front and the lighting make this look like it's going to be a really great overall package. No inlay though inside, only the disc itself was a bit of a letdown. The DVD has some nice extras on it and it has the trailer for the film which is always nice to see. The DVD is easy to pop out and also stays in place when put back inside the holder very well.Spook Meter: 2 Stars. This is one of those horror films that could have been so much more then what it was. I really wanted to love this film but sadly it falls pretty short. I have no complaints with the demons themselves, as I think they look pretty cool although they don't sound so good. I thought the demons sound like some guy or woman growling, like you would find playing I'll scare this kid at a halloween party or something They looked good, sounded bad. Where this film really losses it though comes down to a few main things. First the soundtrack for the film is about the worst that anyone could use for a film that is supposed to set a creepy mood with demons wandering around and attacking people. What you get is some heavy metal songs that play throughout and it makes the movie seem more like a near comedy then anything scary. Don't get me wrong, I love heavy metal music, but for a something like this, it really spoiled the whole mood of the film. A few times, the music would stop and there was the sound of a few errie effects/music that would play for a short time which was great! However that only lasted a few moments and then back to some heavy music again that spoiled the whole mood once again. Next is the acting. I realize this is a B rated film and I don't expect top notch actors but this is so bad that it took the spook right out of the film. If I'm watching a actor and I feel like they going through the words and not really feeling anything themselves then I don't feel the fear either.There were only a couple scenes that one demon kind of gave the film some hope here and there. However overall the soundtrack and acting is what really destroyed this film.Gore Meter: 4 Stars. This is the only thing that helped this film in some areas and gave it hope. Some of the kills are pretty cool and I thought the gore worked well.Profanity Meter: 3 Strikes. There is some language here and there.Sexual Meter: 3 Strikes.

The guys says to the women that some of the cocaine may have dropped down between her breasts. He takes a razor blade and slides her bra over slightly which exposes her nipple slightly. After that he cuts her on her skin slightly with the razor blade, she gets mad and the scene is over. Other then that, there is some makeup scenes but nothing too over the top. I give the sexual meter 3 stars for the fact that there is that scene of nudity involved and wanted to warn some viewers.Final thoughts: Gosh I really hate giving this film 2 stars. Honestly as I watched this I was mad because it had SO MUCH potential and the idea of being trapped in a theater with demons chasing you was so cool! Sadly, a idea alone though can't make a film work if it's spoiled from some other ideas that were VERY bad choices.

Not only is this movie poorly paced and BORING as hell, but the music was poorly concieved and does not fit in at all with the subject matter. Contrary to what everyone says, Demons is rather light on gore and what gore there is is so badly done that it really doesnt even count. The plot was moronic as were about 90% of the casting decisions. Lamberto Bava's only decent efforts I've seen are Blastfighter and Blade in the Dark. Other than that, he's just a hack. A pale imitation of the great man his father was. Bobby Rhodes was cool in this movie though, so I give it stars for that.

One of them, who slightly reminds me of Neve Campbell (the hottie she is!), is on a train and has a slightly disturbing experience when she is followed by a masked man, but he only wants to offer her a ticket to a free movie (but he's not what you think towards the end). They proceed to go to a cathedral-like theater where we are introduced to the other audience members (Urbano is the man in his role!) who are mostly doomed to a grim fate that starts when of the ladies with Urbano's character is scratched by a mask, ultimately leading to her turning into a hideous demon. From there, the demon plague spreads like wildfire and, in turn, many of the non-demons are left to fight against the horde of demons in the theater. The movie is downright disturbing but very campy and kinda silly, but it adds to the movie-within-a-movie premise. The ending did leave the film open, but DEMONS 2 would take the same premise in a different setting with just as gory results and some kind of neat special effects.While very derivative of its time (Dawn of the Dead is better), DEMONS nonetheless is a good Italian horror film, very entertaining, sometimes scary, and downright gory.

Demons is more adventure and suspense with gory horror elements and plenty of goofy characters. It could be the Love Boat of gorefests (though set in a weird Germanic theater and redhead replacing hostess Julie).As with most classic Italian scream fests, the colors and lighting and general style stand out over the plot. You want acting? Forget it, between the dubbing and cartoony characters there's nary a fine actor in sight but that's another element that gives Demons it's comic book/giallo charm.

And kudos to the community because the average number of stars for most films is usually a bulls-eye. Not for this one though! 4 stars for this goofy movie with awful audio is about two too many.The average rating for Demons at the time of my purchase was about 4 stars. Well the story premise might be worth that, but the ultimate plot execution, the acting and especially the sound were absolutely atrocious. Here's the breakdown:Story Premise: Kind of cool actually. A group of movie-goers are lured to a theatre and find that the horror movie that they are being subjected to becomes the group's reality. After one person in the group tries on a possessed mask displayed in the lobby, she becomes possessed herself, starts attacking the others and, similar to zombies that bite, the result is a one by one transition by all into ravenous demons. There is no escape because some malevolent entity has locked and sealed all the exits.Plot Execution: I had the impression that the director must have been age 14 at the time of making this movie. The decisions that the cast made to fight the demons were childish and some of the situations were equally ridiculous (the house of cards collapsed for me even before a helicopter crashes completely intact through the roof of the theatre). The movie's anticlimax is unrealistic and has serious continuity issues.The acting and audio are on par with a 1960s Godzilla movie. This actual quote by of one of the characters, Tony, sums the whole thing up: ...she put on that mask and scratched herself, get it? Because of that scratch she became an instrument of evil, you heard it, we got to stop it I tell you, we got to stop the movie.Yes. Please.

Just kidding. And as an Argento protege (assistant director on TENEBRAE), ol' Lamberto STILL couldn't make a great film if he tried. While A BLADE IN THE DARK and MACABRE were okay offerings, Lamberto put on a different hat and took a shot at this weird take on zombies. Since zombies were old news, they are substituted for demons that look like them and threw in some nonsense by making their existance relevant. Not too many people have read Nostrodamus' book 'Centuries' but I have a good idea that Nostrodamus wouldn't have predicted that a Bava would make a movie this hilarious. The effects are decent and the 'demon' mask was an inventive touch but I couldn't take this movie as seriously as it was intended to be. Goblin returned to add a film score (due to Dario Argento's connections, no doubt) but also in the soundtrack are popular 80's metal bands like Accept. 'Fast as a Shark' is a good song but listenting to it while watching DEMONS just makes for a few laughs.
