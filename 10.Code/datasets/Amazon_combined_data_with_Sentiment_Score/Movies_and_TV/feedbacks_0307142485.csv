The best part about The Little Drummer Boy is its wholesome simplicity. The fact that it is so unabashedly religious is its strongest point in my opinion. Chasing the hate out of your heart and replacing it with love is a valuable lesson for all children, so I agree with another reviewer about its being a timeless family classic. It begins rather slowly but the last five minutes are absolutely outstanding and worth scanning back to watch a second time. The quotations from scripture give it its oomph but this also means that it would never be televised today on any of the big three networks.

16,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,307142485,flickjunkie,"[17, 40]","This 1968 stop-motion animated short adapted from the song of the same name has positive and negative points. On the plus side, we have the beautiful music of the Vienna Boys Choir and a story that draws clear lines between good and evil. On the minus side, the presentation was excessively heavy handed and preachy, especially for very young children. For a young boy to proclaim repeatedly that he HATES all people is a portrayal of psychologically disturbed behavior. Going on to explain his motives by illustrating that his parents were murdered does not put this film in the category of festive holiday videos suitable for young children in my view.Regardless of the outcome and moral of the story (that love conquers hate), many of the scenes presented here require mastery of complex emotional concepts that are beyond the sway of most kids younger than about eight to ten years. Showing scenes of the forceful abduction of a little boy and murder of his parents, animated or not, has great potential to frighten young children who will not fully comprehend that this is intended to be allegorical.Unlike many, I don?t object to the Christian theme. Religion is a pervasive part of the human condition and it needn?t be censored or excoriated just because it makes certain people uncomfortable. However, the film is liberal in its use of name-calling and makes numerous highly intolerant value judgments (perhaps we weren?t so enlightened in 1968, but it was abrasive by any standard).Another thing that struck me as wrongheaded is the way giving is presented as a bargaining tool. The drummer boy doesn?t play his drum as a selfless gift to the baby in the manger; he plays because he wants the baby to heal his lamb. This turns giving into a transaction, giving only to get something in return. I will grant that his motives were good, but is transactional love a message we want to send to our kids?Overall, I would rate this film a 5/10. It is good and instructive for older children and adults, but I would strongly urge parents of children under ten years old to view it before showing it to their children to determine if its themes are suitable for their maturity level.",3,Too heavy handed for young children,976665600,"12 13, 2000",0.1963

47,A36ZCBPPL2MSRG,307142485,The Christmas Boy Tinkle Dinkle!,"[37, 41]","This is a FINE example of what Christmas is ALL ABOUT and not being too preachy. This is the story about Aaron, the Little Drummer Boy, who hates all people because his family was murdered by a group of Desert Thieves. Aaron is kidnapped by Ben Harmed, the greedy and crooked, self proclaimed &quot;Kin of the Desert Showmen&quot;. (played superbly by Hosse' Ferrer) and his bubling assistant, Ollie. The story is told by Greer Garason, with a great air of dignanty. I cry every time I watch this story and there is good reason why (not tears of sadness, but tears of joy over the words of the African King about the Christ Child, because he is SO right!) This story was created by the GREAT Romeo Muller, who is the FINEST children's writer who EVER lived! You can't go wrong with a story writen by Romeo Muller. This one, in fact was his most favorite story that he ever wrote for Rankin/Bass Productions (his most favorite he EVER wrote was NOEL, which is also on video.) But I would HIGHLY recomend this film to anyone and everyone. It's VERY enjoyable and you and your family will love it.",5,One of the BEST Family Oriented Films EVER MADE!,958435200,"05 16, 2000",0.2988

I had it on VCR but had to switch over to DVD (probably have to switch again a decade or two from now). I am in my 40's and still love to watch this very short movie at Christmas time. With all of the advancements in animation these days, it is hard to convince my daughters that this is worth watching but it is the STORY that gets me every time.

49,A2YP1HYB6Q0JEQ,307142485,Todd7,"[1, 1]","Wow, I must say that I was probably the drummer boy's age when I last saw this wonderful Christmas special by Rankin and Bass. If one wants to know the true meaning of Christmas, this is essential viewing. I must say that nowadays gems like this one get shelved, or at least put into obscurity from the big networks, and them not wanting to show anything that depicts religion (aka political correctness). This upsets me, because this special is magnificent, and carries a message of love and forgiveness. In fact, this special is very powerful and emotional, and so different than the other Rankin and Bass classics that highlight Santa, toys, reindeer, and the other stuff that's just supplementary to Christmas. But The Little Drummer Boy gets to the root and core of Christmas, which in the late 1960s was way more socially acceptable. I love this special for its boldness, animation, message, and overall presence. It may seem strange to some, but I find the dated film with raw animation, coupled with darkness, very appealing. This special is just that: it's special, because it has its own identity amongst the many animated Christmas specials out there. I give this the highest rating possible. Refreshing, delightful, powerful, and just right.",5,Oh Boy,1386633600,"12 10, 2013",0.5282
50,A2LR7X3S8DLGBB,307142485,TonyCoach,"[2, 3]","This is the 1968 by Rankin/Bass television special. The story is based on the Christmas song. The young boy Aaron, left orphaned when thieves invade his home, lives a life away from people. He has three dancing animal friends, the drum his parents gave him, and not much else. A greedy traveling showman exploits Aaron and his animals as a musical act. This dark story eventually turns and leads Aaron to the Three Wise Men and the journey to Bethlehem. Voice talent includes Greer Garson who narrates, Jose Ferrer as the showman (he sings too), Paul Frees as all three Wise Men, and the Vienna Boys' Choir singing the title song, one the best versions I've heard. I think with all the Frosty, Rudolph and Heat Miser your kids can watch, this would give them spiritual balance during the holiday.",4,Good Christmas story rarely seen today,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",0.1442

The story is inspired by the evergreen Christmas song and the central character here is a little boy, an orphan who has lost his family in the most horrible way. This has resulted in his hatred and resentment toward others, and it is only through his musical abilities and his experience with the baby Jesus that his life changes for the better. The Little Drummer Boy learns that he does have something to give after all, in spite of his poverty. Greer Garson's narration is serious for the most part, yet also gentle, and Jose Ferrer also does a commendable job. This is a short animated feature and though its old-school animation may be out of date, the story remains a classic that is worthy of being shared with children and adults.",5,A wonderful Christmas story for the entire family.,1292716800,"12 19, 2010",-0.039
