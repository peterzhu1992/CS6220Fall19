The music is infectious, the characters all play memorable parts, the guest actors are WONDERFUL in their roles as Fairy Godfather (Oliver Platt), The Evil StepMom (Kathy Najimy) and Princess (Keri Russell). I play this movie several times per week for our two year old because she just adores watching the scenery and singing along with all the catchy and original songs.

7,A1GX0RFRS0GWRA,738921475,M. Kohary,"[21, 21]","A postively delightful treat for the youngsters, with plenty of jibes thrown in that only the adults will get. Keri Russel is friendly on the eyes and Oliver Platt has a blast. No one is too mean, but nothing is too sappy. The humor is reverant, but kid-friendly. How do the Henson folks do it so consistently? Buy this; your toddler will love it, and it won't drive you insane.",5,Henson Productions do it again,950745600,"02 17, 2000",0.3797
8,A307YFSORUAXSQ,738921475,NYCPickyMom,"[15, 15]","My daughter, who just turned 1, has been an Elmo fan for a little while now. This is the only thing with Elmo that she doesn't like. She wouldn't watch more than 5 minutes of it. It's much different from other of his videos. It's more scripted and less animated than his normal segments. I think it would be more popular with 2 or 3 year olds, especially if they're familiar with Cinderella. I loved it and am saving it. I'm sure my daughter will warm to it in the upcoming months.",3,Not for my 1 year old....YET!,1068768000,"11 14, 2003",0.2014

10,A3S3R88HA0HZG3,738921475,PT Cruiser,"[0, 0]","This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots. They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo. They actually talk back to him when he says, Hello. I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like. He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast. The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour. And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie. So longer is better. This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story. The people actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults. They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable. It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too. It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story. I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys. With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always. Two thumbs up!",5,5 stars for cuteness!,1256688000,"10 28, 2009",0.4421

There's an excellent message from the fairy godfather (godperson) about going out and making something happen vs. waiting around for someone to magically fix everything for you.",5,Good message,981417600,"02 6, 2001",0.6667
