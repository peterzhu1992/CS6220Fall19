This is annoying...especially when you want to go to a number and you have to sit thru the end of the previous chapter and all the while La Petite Prince is chanting 3 3 3 3 3 3 3.I have noticed that the SS DVD's (like Follow that Bird for example) don't have logical clean chapters....why?

Much better choice, I think, for toddlers. Only weakness is that they give short shrift or even skip over certain numbers between 1-20.

We liked it so much, and I was so tired of having to return it after maxing out the renewals just to check it out again, that we decided to buy it. The kids (2 and almost 4 years old) ask for it all the time. I thought they'd be tired of it after a few months, but it still holds their interest. The songs are a great compliation of really great Sesame Street production numbers. We all sing along and, quite frankly, I can't get the songs for the numbers 3, 5, and 10 out of my head. The kids also like the bits with Ernie and Benny (don't call him bunny) between the songs which is usually when the kid's lose interest in this type of DVD.",5,Learn your numbers quickly while having fun!!,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",0.2463

She loves Ernie and Elmo, both of whom appear regularly in the show, and while she still isn't saying her numbers, I'm pretty sure she's getting the concepts figured out. I also make sure to interact with her to help reinforce the concepts and help keep her focused.Even though I've watched it with her for at least half of those viewings, I generally enjoy watching it with her. Part of the reason is the different segments are well-done and actually have the occassional bit of adult humor (e.g., the counting crows who sing about 3 -- supposedly the source for the band's name), and also for the things that happen in the background as Ernie interacts with Benny and the Dinger (for instance, when Ernie dings the Dinger for the first time, watch the action in the background -- it's quite funny, and definitely targeted for the adults who are watching along!).",4,"Good, entertaining, educational video",1012780800,"02 4, 2002",0.508

Lots of the songs are pretty good, and definitely stick in your head. The great thing(imo) is that Elmo has only a small bit, and this video has firmly lodged Ernie as his absolute favorite Sesame Street Character!!!

20,AOG85D9VOHB07,738920762,Michele S. Hays,"[2, 2]","I have to say I had higher hopes for this video; Sesame Street has such a wonderful stable of number clips, and I was hoping to see better ones.So, for the first time, I'm recommending the between-clip footage over the clips! The opening song That's How The Numbers Go could easily become the numerical version of the ABC song; its jazzy and singable and goes all the way to twenty. The setup is that Ernie stops by the Furry Arms Hotel to return a lost room key, where he shows bumbling hotel owners Humphrey and Ingrid that things (like room keys) can be organized with numbers. I also like that this video isn't scrubbed clean of any conflict - the much-maligned bellhop, Benny the Bunny, is one of Kevin Clash's best characters, and he's terrific in this video; he and Ernie show how to return a sour face with a smile (and some innocent teasing!)Although there is one good clip - Martian Beauty #9, unfortunately, this doesn't include some of the ingenious and artistic number clips from Sesame Street past: no bakers falling down stairs, no pinball machine, no counting marble machines. Instead, you get the lukewarm #11 rap, which shows pictures of 11 things, and Five Jive with Elmo Hammer, which is already on too many Sesame Street videos as it is.

She found the rabbit/bellhop character annoying and a little scary. He's kind of ugly and mean, and unfortunately he's the main character after Ernie.

It begins with Ernie finding a room key from the Furry Arms Hotel and he proceeds there to return it. Once there, he engages in some banter with Benny the Bunny, the hotel owner and some hotel staff. This goes on for several minutes and becomes tedious before some short Sesame Street segments are able to offer a brief respite. Some of these are good, though the song with three blackbirds is not very good and lasts too long. Also, the MC Elmo song about the Number Five is also on The Best of Elmo DVD; so, if you are looking for exclusive Elmo material for your child, this is not your best bet. Now, I like Ernie as much as the next person, but I'm not certain what they were thinking when they decided to feature so much interaction with other, practically unknown characters. He ends up dinging the bellhop bell fifteen times, which is way too repetitious for even the youngest viewer.
