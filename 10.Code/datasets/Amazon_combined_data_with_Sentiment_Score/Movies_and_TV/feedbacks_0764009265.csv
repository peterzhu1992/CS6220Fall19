Little does the audience know someone is actually emulating the same crime in their theater! Stylishly directed entertainment, Anguish's high point is its middle half-hour segment, a long, superbly directed sequence that cuts back and forth between the theater's bathrooms, the lobby, the audience and the movie they're watching. Loses some momentum in the last ten minutes, and the final scenes, while pretty scary, are still a little cheap.

Its in those years that the best horror movies were released, real horror movies with elements of magic , fantasy and sex as well as gore, not just violent slasher films that we have today like Saw or Hostel, not that i hate them or anything, i still have respect for the whole horror genre but they don't even come close to the quality and level of entertainment of those awesome 80's films. Directors like Dario Argento, Lamberto Bava, Wes Craven and George Romero pushed the limits of horror and fantastic by releasing some of their best work in career with movies like OPERA, DEMONS,NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD and so on......Anguish always been an underrated movie since the director, Bigas Luna, was not very known at that time and that movie was probably his first attempt at horror movies. The result was an astonishing 86 minutes flick with unique special effects and hypnotic suggestion that were never tried since by other directors in the genre. NO JOKE, THIS IS A HELL OF A RIDE!!!!......very similar to DEMONS by Lamberto BavaWe also have a real special warning on this DVD before the film starts, explaining what we are about to experience, hypnotic suggestions, some strobing and very intense special effects. The warning also says that they, (the movie producers) had provided real medical service which was free of charge upon presenting your ticket, OXYGEN MASKS WERE AVAILABLE!!!! (no joke, serious stuff!!) as well as medical personal. While this crazy warning is going on, you can see another one that's actually written on the screen and basically says that yes, if you get dizzy, scared, if you start panicking, if you start feeling out of place, YOU MUST LEAVE THE AUDITORIUM RIGHT AWAY!!!. And yes, its true, having seeing it myself, there is really a moment in the movie where you actually lose your sense of balance and perception to a point where you may actually turn around to make sure your still in your living room watching a movie.......sounds freaky doesn't it???....but its true!! It is extremely well done!!!The photography (director of photography) is really good!!! They used some techniques here that you probably never seen before. Without giving away one of the important surprise effect here, i would say that at some point, you will really feel that other people are joining you to watch the movie (yes, despite the fact that your in your living room alone..lol..).....hhhmmmm.....curious?..............As for the story, it is a good and original plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat!!. Michael Lerner is an eye clinic physician who's work doesn't seem to be appreciated by some of his clients and co-workers, After being hypnotized by his mother, who's completely on her sons side, he goes on a crazy mission to get all the eyes of the city in order to get revenge....i know it sounds weird for a movie plot but trust me.... this one deserves a try!

Wilson SonRisedInTheEast,"[1, 1]","Malformed, distorted, misshapen, deformed... all words that could be used to describe the plot and delivery of this (as well as starring actress Zelda Rubinstein... I know, I shouldn't have gone there), 1989's little known horror film Anguish. A somewhat interesting premise that features a movie inside of a movie angle, where the film that we initially are watching turns into the background of a second story taking place within a movie theater (think 1985's Italian splatterfest Demons for a good example of this), ultimately gets bogged down by an unintelligible script filled with unapealing characters (to downright obnoxious... Zelda, I'm talking to you again). In the first film, Michael Lerner (Barton Fink, Maniac Cop 2, Elf) stars as an unstable eye doctor who is hypnotized by his mother (Zelda)to kill... and also to remove the eyes of the victims. Some decent scenes of grue take place but more time is wasted on the scenes of hynotization which try REALLY hard to be unique and artistic but David Lynch this ain't (with Zelda spewing lines of psychobabble such as, you once where like a snail... hidden... happy). The second part involves a man obsessed with the movie loosing it inside the theater while the first film plays on in the background. Fairly tame from this point forward as our new antagonist's weapon of choice is a silenced pistol (and he has no interest in removing the victims eyes... bah!). Maybe the director was attempting to make a visionary piece of filmaking about how life can imitate art? Maybe... but this is schlock through and through (the twist ending solidifies this statement), whether you want to put a fancey bow on top of it or not (at least movies like Friday The 13th know exactly what they are). Looking at the other reviews on here, Anguish has a following that feel it's a really good film (although so does Boogeyman...)so there may be something I'm missing, but if you are on the hunt for anything mildly scary or disturbing I'd look elsewhere... though those looking for something with a little originality, or in the need of a Zelda Rubinstein fix, could certainly do worse (you could just watch Poltergeist again though?).",2,"Anguish?

10,A3L2U581LL17EB,764009265,Eric,"[3, 9]","Anguish begins by introducing us to Michael Lerner as John, an eye doctor, and Zelda Rubenstein as his overprotective mother. It turns out Lerner has an obsession with cutting out people's eyes, possibly because he's losing his own eyesight, and he also happens to have some kind of telepathic bond with his mother.But wait, the camera pans back to reveal all this to be a movie that an audience is watching. The main focus is now on two girls in this crowd, one of which happens to be frightened out of her mind by the picture. When she sees Lerner on-screen enter a movie theater and kill off the audience, she begins to believe someone amid her own crowd is about to do the same. What do you know, she's right.Anguish has a good premise, doesn't it? Too bad it fails to gel. First off, there are the hypnosis scenes in the first twenty or so minutes. Rather than being disturbing or visually entrancing, it's just hilarious. Watching Lerner wave his hands in front of the screen while he spins over and over is a pretty funny sight. The yellow-tint cinematography is more annoying than atmospheric, making the film look as if though it were covered in butter.Once the twist reveals itself to be movie-within-a-movie, things don't get better. Our protagonist, named Patty, happens to be a terrible actress who isn't the slightest bit convincing. Sure, many slashers star actresses who aren't particularly talented, but they can usually get by with good looks and gratuitous nudity. Admittedly, around the forty minute mark, things do get slightly suspenseful once the killer in the real audience starts knocking people off one-by-one, but it's pretty disappointing to see him use a gun rather than a knife, and the theater is too crowded to gain maximum creepiness. Almost as detrimental is the fact the film is set during daytime, which destroys the chance for inescapable atmosphere.The last fifteen minutes degenerate rapidly, not making much sense at all, though I gather that was director Bigas Lunas' intent. The final scene is a big shaggy-dog joke and you get the feeling Lunas is trying to make some kind of commentary on how blurred fiction and reality can get, but it's all muddled nonsense. As I recall, only one horror film ever accomplished such a task, John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness, a fun, unique rollercoaster ride that was genuinely frightening not only with its explicit frights, but the implications of them. That film also managed to develop a sense of chaos while following a srange form of logic. On the other hand, Anguish is an entirely forgettable slasher that's no better (and less enjoyable) than some of its more low-rent cousins (such as the Friday the 13th and Slumber Party Massacre series).",2,Good premise goes to waste.,1031443200,"09 8, 2002",-0.2152

15,A1J1163Q56YIVZ,764009265,Shaun Anderson,"[3, 4]","The horror and science-fiction genres one could argue are inherently post-modern, the ease with which they interchange, and their long standing propensity for pastiche and homage, mark them out as particularly appropriate forms for directors with post-modern sensibilities. But post-modernism as a critical tool is very different to what has been termed the `post-modern' horror film. The distinction here is films that are weighed down by a knowing self-awareness and self-reflexivity and a need to quote from a myriad of sources. As we know histories are written by the winners, and in the case of the post-modern horror film the major figure is Wes Craven. His two key contributions; A New Nightmare and Scream sent the horror genre down a path which unfortunately turned into a creative cul-de-sac. Fortunately for Craven, the excellent Spanish horror film Anguish directed by Bigas Luna became an instant obscurity on its release in 1987. I say fortunate because this film could arguably be seen as the first truly self-conscious post-modern horror film.Luna is perhaps best know to audiences who frequent the art cinema circuit, but Anguish nestles neatly and quietly in a filmography that is better know for the arty eroticism of The Ages of Lulu and The Tit and the Moon. Perhaps the fact that Lunas had not worked within the horror genre before or after gave him a certain critical distance, and one which was able to utilise the predictable clich&eacute;s of the slasher movie, and then to essentially satirise them. Naturally with exercises like this, the film comes perilously close to becoming a little too clever for its own good, but Lunas is not afraid to get his hands dirty and the film is decorated with a number of gruesome and violent moments.It is very difficult to talk about this film without giving it away, but its sufficient to say that the film within a film structure, which is then tripled by the audiences own experience of watching two films unfolding makes for a radical departure from 1980's norms. The films emphasis on eyes and vision makes the critique of spectatorship a little too obvious perhaps, but other themes such as matriarchal dominance, and the question of whether films of this type can have a real and substantial influence on people gives it an added layer of value. Watching it now, the film seems ripe for academic re-assessment. I say this because as well as self-consciously satirising slasher conventions, Lunas also self-consciously created a film that appeals to such theoretical approaches as psychoanalysis. In its coveting of high cultural critical approaches, Anguish becomes a pretty arty movie in its own right, suggesting this is far from an aberration in the Spaniards filmography. This review has purposefully avoided going into plot details, I understand due to the obscurity of the film that many readers may not have seen it, and this is a film that can be spoiled all to easily by a single clumsy review.",4,Excellent Self-Reflexive Horror Film,1214265600,"06 24, 2008",-0.2184

I am also aware that this very special film is not for everyone. But unless the DVD is incrediby botched, my 5 stars stand proudly.It's difficult to review this film because I don't want to spoil the experience of watching such a slippery, convoluted experiment in cinematic narrative. Let me just say that this film's narrative structure is highly unusual, and the frequent sudden shifts of reference could cause a bit of vertigo in the viewer as they try to figure out just what the heck is going on, only to have their hypothisis shattered (or at least tightly twisted) a few minutes later. This twisting, shifting narrative is fascinating to me, even though others may find it annoying. It's like living in a chinese box puzzle.Perhaps I am especially partial to the film because I saw it in its original theatrical release. The theatre in which I watched it apparently had a very cool manager. During the last scenes of the film, when all the temporal and spatial references collapse, this theatre staged yet another plot twist by presenting yet another twist to the plot, enacted by a live cast, sort of like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The effect was startling and disorienting.SPOILER ALERT!!!! Do not read any farther if you haven't seen the film before.Imagine This: There is a movie, a silent movie, playing on a theatre screen. In the theatre, there is a murderer holding a person hostage in front of the screen, but this, too, is a movie . . . and in the theatre in which it is playing, there is a murderer holding a person hostage in front of the screen . . . but this, too, is a movie . . . and in thetheatre in which it is playing there is a murderer holding a person hostage in front of the screen . . . but this, too, is a movie . . . and in the theatre in which it is playing -- the theatre where YOU are sitting . . . there is a murderer holding a hostage in front of the screen. Yes, this murderer and his hostage are in the theatre with you, and the hostage was sitting on the same row you are sitting on. Then the police break in to all four theatres (yes, even the one where you are sitting) and shots are fired, and the movie ends. On the screen is the interior of Theatre number 3, and the credits unfold on that screen, as people in the MOVIE begin to file out of the theatre where they were sitting, amd apparently somehow find themselves in the theatre where You are sitting, because people are also exiting from THIS theatre.Now, of course, unless you really work on it, the live show in the theatre where you are sitting, will not happen. Police will probably not break down your door and shoot the villian holding a friend of yours hostage in front of your tv, but when you actually watch ANGUISH, why not imagine this 4th theatre, this is actually your TV room, and that this fourth layer of the plot is actually taking place in your home.PS: As long as we're spilling spoilers, let me invite you to be sure you have your surrounds run up all the way when watching the film. There is an extremely disorienting disconnect between layers early in the movie, as we assume we are watching one movie, but then begin to hear conversation and popcorn crunching all about us. Then the image is reframed and you realize that you have been watching a movie within a movie.Watch With: The 1,000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse, Memento, Identity, The Tingler, and any film that has an experimental narrative structure, such as Last Year at Marienbad, Intolerance, Time Code, etc.",5,Fascinating Film,1210118400,"05 7, 2008",-0.0584

What is Real, what is illusion, and in the final analysis, does it matter?Throughout the film the address of the eye is undercut by other sensory cues, most memorably in the scene when audio surround information suddenly reframes our &quot;reality&quot; as part of a movie in a movie - a moment which somehow relaxes our tension and increases it at the same time. I'm reminded here of the astonishing scene in Fritz Lang's 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse when the audience discovers an entire frame of reference beyond the surface reality it had assumed was in place.
