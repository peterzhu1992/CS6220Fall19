I loved this special when I was a kid, liked the story. the jokes and the one liners , gags, music and good lessons that were in this show,also it got me interested in history, art and things that had to with Egypt history and culture and you saw that people aren't really that different. only in ethic background and upbringing, but that each one of us can be friends and share things in common as a whole, that's what I took away from it anyway.I Do wish that this special gets a proper release soon from CTW, this is quite shameful guys because Big Bird In China is available so are all the others including the classic Christmas Eve on Sesame Street. So what's up with the hold up on this one? This one is a milestone along with the Christmas Eve special, so let Don't Eat the Pictures see the light of day okay! I'd like to purchase this title someday.I've been searching for this for quite sometime, only remember the story and not the title and ran across this in my search of the Christmas eve special thank goodness for that. :) I actually bought the Christmas eve special and again i plan on buying this title when it is available for purchase,just a reminder CTW.I laugh at people that think this special is evil , far from it. Only total morons would believe that ,it's a great special for kids as I have said before above in my comments. I hope someday CTW will see the follies of they're ways and release this classic title Long Live Don't Eat the Pictures.Highly Recommended Title For Kids.",5,A Sesame Street Classic Not On DVD?

I remember when it first premiered on PBS (Channel 11 in Chicago, where I grew up). My sister and I were allowed to stay up late on a Sunday night just to watch it. Then I didn't see it again for many years until I found it for sale on Amazon.It's such a cute video. The adults of Sesame Street take Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Grover, and some of the kids to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Just as the museum is about to close, Big Bird says that Snuffy was supposed to meet him. Of course this draws a lot of moans and groans from the adults, as Snuffy wouldn't make his debut for two more years. Big Bird sneaks away to find Snuffy just as the museum is closing! It becomes a game of cat and mouse as the night guard is sure that something weird is going on and the gang just slips by him. But the biggest story is that Snuffy and Big Bird meet an ancient Egyptian prince named Sahou. Sahou has been trying to get into Heaven for 3,000 years but he can't because he can't answer a riddle. Big Bird and Snuffy come to the rescue to come up with the answer.There are also some cute little songs in here, like Mothers and Children, sung by Olivia, Don't eat the Pictures, done by Cookie Monster and the Girls, and You'll get Home Soon, by Big Bird and Sahou. I liked this video and I plan to share it with my own children someday because it opens up the world of art appreciation to them. Very well done. And no Elmo!",5,"A night at the museum, Sesame Street style!",1181433600,"06 10, 2007",0.1476
2,A1JZRUC7GUYFO3,738921467,L. McCracken careful shopper,"[1, 1]","This one should be reissued in DVD. I am a grandmother and remembered how much my children, one of which is now a professional artist, loved this. I was not wrong. My three year old granddaughter requests to see it everyday over many other choices when she comes to visit. She is frightened by the wizard and cried when Sahu goes to his parents; she didn't understand why he went away, but would just come get us to sit with her for that part. She is still requesting it a year later. I have memorized the songs. As with so many others brought to you by Sesame Street it is treasure for all ages.",5,"Great, great tape!",1231718400,"01 12, 2009",0.107

It's amusing for them because it features some really silly short films and cartoons. It's amusing for me because of the Siskel and Ebert-style format with Oscar and Telly. It's one tape I don't mind playing for them frequently because It appeals to me as well.",5,My daughters loves this tape,1099612800,"11 5, 2004",0.2424

Unlike today's emphasis on dumbing down programing ala Barney, this video tape was made in a time when children were actually respected and given enormous respect.Granted some of the acting seems weird because of the programing shift, but I seriously doubt that it would scare today's little kids. I watched it as a little girl, and keep hoping that it will be released.One of the unexpected side effects of this non-condescending treatment is that young adults such as myself still fondly remember this movie and are not at all bored by the pace. Whatever your chronological age, you will find this program timeless in it's appeal and beloved by all.That is what indicates real staying power, not how many toys one can invent, market and make profit from.",5,I should be able to give it a higher number,992390400,"06 13, 2001",0.247
5,A37S3ACL57LN62,738921467,Samantha Glasser Maliejandra,"[5, 5]","As a kid, I used to watch Sesame Street, a show that was by then a classic. My parents bought this film from the library and my sister and I watched it constantly. My dad still remembers songs from the film and my sister and I reminisce about it.The plot of the story is that the kids and the puppets get locked into a museum overnight. They get to tour the area without being bothered by others. Oscar the Grouch sings a song about wonderful trash, referring to the broken statues all around him. Cookie Monster sings the title song when he gets hungry from looking at still life paintings all night. Big Bird and Snuffy find an Egyptian Prince and attempt to help him become a star in the sky like his parents. Everything that happens is entertaining and educational.Not only does this film address a side of schooling that isn't always addressed in schools, art, it is a great way for parents to spend time with their children and help them to grow.",5,Very Memorable,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",0.1703
