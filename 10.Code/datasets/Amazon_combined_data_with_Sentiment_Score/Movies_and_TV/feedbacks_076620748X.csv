Having not yet seen Omega Code and after having been profoundly disappointed (and, yes, BAD bored) with the recent Left Behind, I had a sort of HO-hum attitude when I saw this advertised at the local marquee. Regardless, at my wife's behest, we saw it last Saturday night, and it - literally - was a religious experience. I'm no Biblical scholor, but Megiddo seemed to be quite Scripturally correct, drawing almost directly from the Books of Daniel and Revelations. And I was very satisfied with the movie's resolution. One minor quibbling point, though: at the beginning of the movie, when it is trying to establish Stone Alexander's character, the writers seem to have borrowed greatly from the first two installments of the Omen series of some 25 years ago: Stone's the son of a political figure, he has an evil supernatural guardian, and he first starts showing his...true disposition while at a military school. Even Michael Beihn, the protagonist, the good guy of Megiddo, favors Sam Neill, who portrayed Michael York's character, the Antichrist, in Omen. However, York's portrayal of this dispicable character is more realistic, a tad less smarmy, less Hollywood than was the Omen's Damien Thorn. It's a great movie, but is is too intense for younger children. Oh, one very moot final point, when seen concurrently with Omega Code, the producers present the events of these movies within a pre-millenium context.",5,"...And we ARE living in these times, folks",1002931200,"10 13, 2001",0.0803

Ignoring the automatic raves that TBN's movies always seem to get, many early reviews I read were not encouraging. I sat all the way through the first one, for some reason, and was not going to make that mistake again.This film does have problems. It's better-written than Omega Code but only just. Its &quot;symbolic&quot; moments often make this next-to incoherent. Michael York chews too much scenery. The battle scenes were rather amateurish and went on way too long. My Lord and Savior still doesn't put in an appearance(odd for a Christian movie). And there are others. But with all that in mind, I have to admit something.Matt Crouch is learning.This is a FAR better movie than Omega Code. Granted, that's not saying much(nowhere to go but up). But Trenchard-Smith is a much better director than Robert Macarelli and knows how to keep things moving. The story, although it took a little too long to get going and was a bit jumbled at times, was a good one and kept me to the end. There are some frightening moments here. Michael Biehn is a very underrated actor, light years better than Casper Van Dien, and steals this thing away from Michael York. The computer-generated Satan, although a bit obvious, was done very well. And, although you don't see the Winner of the fight, you do get to see Satan bow the knee to Him and then be cast into hell and bound, which rather got to many of the people I saw this with.Revelations is still too broad a story to do in one rather short movie. And it needs FAR more money than TBN has spent on it. I hope TBN leaves off blockbusters for a while in favor of smaller, managable stories with Christian messages. They've shown they can do a reasonably good job.Although this movie is not great, it was not the disaster I was expecting and is worth a look.",3,A surprise,1001721600,"09 29, 2001",-0.0282

What happened on September 11 signaled the beginning of the end of the world. VERY timely in light of the tragic events that have been happening. Thank you to EVERYONE who worked pon this movie.

3,A1QAULZ03WCAEO,076620748X,ShadeTree,"[0, 0]","I didn't get past the first twenty minutes of the film. For some reason, they decided to focus on the bad guy instead of the good guy - a huge mistake. Without a protagonist to focus on, I got impatient waiting for the real movie to start, to get away from this nasty guy, but that never happens. It is all about him. The so-called good guy takes a backseat, while we get to watch the anti-Christ working his evil. The scenes are choppy, losely strung together - no unity or coherence at all. They look deceptively professional, as far as the picture quality goes, and the acting is professional. Maybe the rest of the movie gets better, but in my opinion, if they can't get it right in the first twenty minutes, the movie just isn't worth watching.",1,poorly put together,1314748800,"08 31, 2011",-0.1682
4,A3VQSFORKH8B7O,076620748X,Steven Hancock,"[28, 35]","After seeing THE OMEGA CODE, which I gave three stars for very little drama and cheesy visual effects, I found this to be a very refreshing look at the time which will be coming. For a film that cost only $20 Million to make, the film has awesome visual effects, and plenty of 'em. The storytelling was very different, actually putting in a good amount of characterization and plot. It is at times dramatic, and at times terrifying. The acting was very good (Michael York is MUCH better as Stone Alexander in this film than in THE OMEGA CODE). Michael Biehn gives the best performance of his career as David Alexander, Stone's brother. Anybody who liked THE OMEGA CODE, or like movies with excitement, drama, and mind-riveting storytelling, will love this movie. I guarantee it!

5,A6T1ENVR6O7OT,076620748X,usareader,"[21, 26]","Kudos to the producers and writers of this screenplay who managed to avoid the pit-falls of this movie's predecessor - Omega Code. Production values, greatly increased in this attempt, and a human story-line which lasts virtually throughout the first 2/3's of the movie, help to carry it along. More sophisticated writing, editing and directing make the experience far more engaging, while the holes in plot and realism (still present on occasion) are kept to a minimum. While the &quot;Omega Code&quot; suffered greatly from hammy acting, &quot;Megiddo&quot; stars shine, including the performances of each actor who played the Beast at various ages (with deference to Michael York's wonderful portrayal), a superb performance by Gabrielle (the Beast's Christian wife) and young David (brother to the Beast). For technical quality, the first half of the movie seems to have shaken the problems inherant to &quot;Omega.&quot; The score was greatly and pleasantly improved the first half, yet regressed the latter during heightened battle scenes. While the final battle scene is visually anti-climatic and long, the anticipated destination of the Beast keeps genuine interest till the end. &quot;Megiddo&quot; may be the best blatantly &quot;Christian&quot; work to date and is worth the trip for the story. Don't go expecting it to be incredible, but perhaps maybe a little surprised.",4,A Little Surprised.,1001635200,"09 28, 2001",0.4934
