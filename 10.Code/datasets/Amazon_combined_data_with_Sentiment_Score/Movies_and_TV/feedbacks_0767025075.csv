0,AD5J3CQT0KSWO,767025075,Alaric Raid,"[0, 0]","This is a six episode set of the British classic. It starts with The White Elepahnt, an animal we do not get to see and ends with Steed inheriting a race horse in The Trojan Horse. In between are episodes of double agents and diabolical organizations which are a staple of the Emma Peel years. Still a good taste of Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale. She is finally starting to stand up to the upstart Steed, trying to be a full parter in the dou that is finally given to Ms. Peel.Biggest down side of the DVD is the lack of features. Only production stills which are on all the A & E Avenger videos.",4,Early Avengers with Cathy Gale,1243123200,"05 24, 2009",0.0681

Behrens Frank Behrens,"[16, 16]","It is so very good to be able to see the &quot;old&quot; &lt;Avengers&gt; with Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale, not only for its own sake but as an historic document (so to speak) and as a foreshadowing of the greater things to come the very next season when Diana Rigg continued to make television history as Blackman's replacement.First the negatives. These are &quot;live,&quot; studio-bound productions in which lines are flubbed, jailers have all sorts of trouble opening the doors to cells, gun shots do not convince, and fights are obviously tame to prevent injury in these days before films, stunt-doubles, and retakes. Now and then the sound gets fainter as characters move away from the mikes, now and then the film jumps just a bit, and in at least two sequences a pesky fly seems to have been caught by whatever process was being used to reproduce the original image onto tape/DVD.Neither positive nor negative but merely interesting is that Steed has not picked up his ultra-refined characteristics by way of wardrobe, umbrella (until the last episodes), and steel-coated bowler hat. His relationship with Cathy varies from amused tolerance on her part to such manifestations of her annoyance as throwing things at him. She takes things a lot more seriously than Emma will. In fact, there is little of that Avengers banter we so enjoy in the later episodes and consequently not so much of that chemistry between the two.There are three episodes on each DVD and twelve in all in this '64 series. Set 1 starts with &quot;The Little White Elephant,&quot; and it is about smuggling using animal cages and it moves slowly. &quot;The Little Wonders&quot; has considerable humor with its hoods dressed as clergymen and a shoot-'em-up finale (possibly meant to be taken seriously but funny all the same) that makes the last scene of &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; look tame. &quot;The Wringer&quot; is very much like &quot;The Ipcress File&quot; film with its brainwashing episodes. &quot;Mandrake&quot; has the first great sexy-woman vs. he-man as Cathy tosses a sexton (played by a popular wrestler) around a graveyard. [That is the same wrestler that tosses Mr. Humphries around in a late episode of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;) &quot;The Secrets Broker&quot; is purely about blackmail and &quot;The Trojan Horse&quot; about Dick Francis kinds of doings on the racetrack.Please watch these without the foresight of what is to come and try to keep a 1964 frame of mind when this was the hottest stuff on the telly and a female character never had it so good before Cathy Gale blew into town.",4,Historic and most entertaining,956275200,"04 21, 2000",0.248

You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. How it looks and sounds? Like John Steed (Patrick Macnee) might say to Cathy Gale (Honor Blackman), You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please. Be a good girl and turn on the TV. John and Cathy Gale are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask again, how do they look? They look good, very good indeed Steed.",5,Steel Leather and an Umbrella Cathy?,972086400,"10 21, 2000",0.2735

4,A20JYIHL1W1U54,767025075,hille2000 hille2000,"[3, 7]","`The Avengers was a popular 1960's British fantasy-adventure series that focused on the exploits of a male-female duo in the service of the British government. The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed's first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman (of &quot;Goldfinger&quot; fame) departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed's new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest. These DVD copies are gorgeous.",5,John Steed and Kathy Gale,984528000,"03 14, 2001",0.4049

6,A2BNSJW5KX9M5H,767025075,J. Ewaniuk,"[16, 17]","Most Avengers fans in this country know of the Avengers as John Steed and Emma Peel. But before that there was Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale, who paved the way for Emma Peel. Cathy is a no nonsense character, very smart, very cool, very efficient. These episodes have been shown on American TV only once - in early 1991 on the A&amp;E netwoork (A&amp;E has sunce lost the broadcast rights), and at that time they were almost 30 years old. These were done like live TV, and are in black and white. The theme song is altogether different from the Laurie Johnson theme, but it does grow on you. Because they are like live TV there are some timing mistakes and there is sometimes a little difficulty hearing the dialogue. Contrary to published reports, there are no subtitles on the DVDs, and the only reason I don't give the collection a full five stars is that there was some sloppiness in the transfer - in two episodes on Set 1, a fly obviously got in the machine, and can be seen crawling around. Here we are trying to pay attention to the plot, and are distracted by what looks to be a fly crawling on the actors' faces in close-up. The fly is absent from these same episodes when I taped them from A&amp;E nine years ago.Why they started with the last episodes on the Blackman series is beyond me. There are many great episodes from both her first and second seasons with the show, as well as quite a few episodes where Steed (a bit of a cad in these shows) &quot;uses&quot; other civilians to help him with his missions. I look forward to their release as well.",4,Most Fans Haven't Seen These Before,955324800,"04 10, 2000",0.1413
