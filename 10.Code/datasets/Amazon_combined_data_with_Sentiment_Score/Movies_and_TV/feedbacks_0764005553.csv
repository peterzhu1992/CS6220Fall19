Midnight Madness is one of those movies for me. I remember seeing it, or scenes anyways, but it was all a blur. It was always a movie I wanted to get and finally watch, and now that I have, how did the faded memories of a movie I only remember existing fare to me all these years later?Midnight Madness is a movie where a nerdy guy named Leon sets up a very elaborate scavenger hunt all over Los Angeles. He finds 5 college students to lead 5 teams who start off on a clue and have to go to each location all over town to get the next clue and, eventually, get to the end before the other team. Yellow team are the nice, good guys. Blue team are a bunch of questionable slobs/dimbulbs with a super computer. Red team are girls from a sorority. White team are a bunch of nerds. Green team are the beer swilling meathead jocks. Naturally, it's a spirited romp as our teams navigate the streets of L.A. at night, find some trouble, and try to get to the final clue.This movie would also mark the movie debut of Michael J. Fox and Paul Pee Wee Herman Reubens.Midnight Madness is really a movie of it's time. That's always part of the joy of these movies. Movies that had a very definite imprint of it's era and culture. That's always very rich to me, and MM doesn't disappoint. It's pure late 70s/early 80s fun in the way that can only come from that era in time (and is so missing in movies today). Familiar faces here include David Naughton (An American Werewolf In London), Eddie Deezen (Grease), and the already mentioned Fox and Reubens. Stephen Furst, who is known as slob-ish, comedic characters (Animal House, Class Reunion, Up The Creek), is once again the slob, although he is also the villain of the piece.Midnight Madness may not win any awards, but it's an enjoyable and memorable film with fun scenes that is pretty well set up in the scavenger hunt and all that ensues. It has slapstick, low brow humor, questionable title track, etc. What more could anyone want? If there is any downside, it's that you won't really care for most of the teams and only really want one (or two) to win out of the 5. The end result isn't a surprise, but it may of been for it's time in 1980. Other than that, I have no real complaints. It's a fun, if by the numbers, comedy that works and delivers because of the fun premise, nostalgia factor, and cast.",3,Look Between The Giant Melons!,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",0.1405

Rossi,"[0, 0]","Midnight Madness is a perfect example of how you can do great comedy without having to be overly raunchy, sex filled or disgusting, a trait that Hollywood would do well to emulate in current comedies. The teams are all stereotypes but the fun factor is ENORMOUS! Is it realistic? Of course not, but as in other films like it from the same time frame, the joy is in over the top exaggerated situations. Leon's clues are clever, and clever usually isn't a word to be used in conjunction with a college screwball comedy.You get the feeling early in the film that Michael J Fox's role as Scott may have originally been smaller but somebody got smart and gave him more to do to further develop the character and provide some interesting twists.It's super fun seeing Paul Ruebens (AKA Pee Wee Herman) in cowboy gear as the pinball arcade manager. The pinball arcade war is pretty ridiculous too and while it's unnecessary to the plot of the film, you can't help but love the exuberant energy and slapstick foolishness of it.Cheesy music is predominant in the movie but you'll have a tough time getting the incredibly catchy disco theme song 'Midnight Madness' out of your head.

The film was barely released in theaters and was given mostly negative reviews by critics. It has since risen to cult status (although I fail to see how). It is universally dismal on every level, from concept to acting, the screenplay, et al. I watched it in utter disbelief. The plot is limited to a puzzle `game' that groups of students rush to solve (for no greater prize than a crummy plaque). Along the way, they revel in dirty tricks and complications of stupidity. Most of the so-called contestants are unpleasant stereotypes. The destruction of property along the way is astounding given there are no repercussions for their actions. (That appears to be the main theme of this movie: search and destroy.) That it also happens to be a Disney flick is unbelievable. The only thing worth noting is the brief appearance of Paul Reubens. Otherwise, it's pretty bland fare, a lot of low impact `humor' (depending entirely on your sense of humor).It's certainly watchable but nothing I'd care to keep for future viewing.",3,Chump change,1376697600,"08 17, 2013",-0.3157
13,A10DQWWRKGQ6FY,764005553,Eric B. Gordon The greatest thing we ever ha...,"[0, 0]","Sure, this movie may seem quite dated, but it's nevertheless quite underrated. A highly unique game that takes the players on an all-ight scavenger hunt around the city of Los Angeles, looking for clues that'll propell them forward when solved. The contributers consist of one skinny college genius, two pretty girl accomplices and five teams of students from varying walks of life. Three of the teams may appear stereotyped: the red team compraises four members of an outcast sorority; the white team consists of a quartet of skinny, four-eyed debaters; the green team includes fivefootball gorillas who spend their time off the field creating misery for he other teams. But, these individuals are still genuine at the core.The core focus of the film's main body is the competition between the blue team and the yellow team. The yellow team's leader, Adam (played by David Naughton) is a highly intelligent, driven and forward-looking college senior who understands the importance of teamwork. The blue team leader, Harold (Stephen Furst) is self-centered, overweight and oblivious to the world around him. While Adam enters the game willingly, Harold is forced headlong into it b his frustrated father. And, while the yellow team is interested in fair play and following directions, Harold's only interest is in winning and going to any extremes to do it.Interestingly enough, this movie was produced at a pivotal moment in American pop culture. At the start of the game, we witness the red team inhabiting a discoteque, the likes of which had already begun to go out of fashion. Also of note was the use of the Pabst Brewery as a clue location; Pabst Blue Ribbon bear is now produced by the Miller corporation. Another clue location is in an arcade referred to as Pinball City and, as the name would suggest, populated largely by pinball tables. One of few videogames in the place is an actual game called StarFire. This game pointedly draws on the first StarWars film from 1977. In one year's time, there'd be more videogames than anything in most arcades and more money going towards playing them than towards buying music.In addition, the Walt Disney company and Buena Vista Entertainment made a supposedly calculated move when the movie was packaged, not including the Disney logo, for fear that a PG-rated movie would tarnish their reputation. However, this writer is mildly convinced that the inclusion of Disney packaging might've aided this film's popularity on the strength of notoriety. Six years later, we were given the Disney film flight of the Navigator, and their adult divison, Touchstone Pictures was fully active, producing pictures of its own.The leading man, (Naughton) is best known for his role in the 1981 comedic horror flick, An American Werewolf in London. It is commonly believed that Naughton was chosen by director John Landis for this role on the heals of his spokesmanship for Dr. Pepper. However, as mentioned before, Naughton's advocary is played by Stephen Furst. Furst is best known for his portrayal of Kent 'Flounder' Dorfman in the Landis film Animal House. This writer is convinced that Landis opted to follow Stephen Furst's caeer path. This would ultimately lead to a screening of Midnight Madness, in which case David Naughton would become clearly visible. The likelihood that John Landis would recruit Naughton American Werewolf on the heels of this film is at least as likely as on the heels of a soft-drink commercial.(Of corse, it doesn't hurt that one of the jocks is portrayed by Dirk Blocker, whose legendary father Dan Blocker was internationally known for portraying Eric Hoss Cartwright on Bonanza. Dirk also made a cameo appearance during Season 1 of Little House on the Prairie. And, his character definiely adds surrealistic levity to the film's main plot.

16,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,764005553,Jeffrey Leach,"[13, 15]","Midnight Madness, I learned, was only the second live action 'PG' rated film to come out of Disney studios. The first was the science fiction film The Black Hole, a movie best left moldering on video store shelves. Midnight Madness will never fade away since HBO, in its infinite wisdom, played the film on a perpetual loop from roughly 1982 to 1986. I must have watched this movie a thousand times during that period, and so did a million other people from the looks of it. Strangely, I completely forgot about the film for seventeen years, only remembering it when I stumbled over reviews for the picture on some website. Unfortunately, at the time it had not come out on DVD, so I had to wait until Disney saw fit to release it. Rewatching any film after a nearly two-decade interregnum is often a painful experience. In the case of Midnight Madness, the sheer exuberance of the actors' performances and the wild hilarity of the plot completely overshadow spots of bad acting and general cheesiness. Never the sort of film that would win any awards-except for one of those raspberry trophies, perhaps-the picture still entertains. HBO ought add this to the queue again.Midnight Madness is a scavenger hunt film in the vein of Scavenger Hunt, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, and Million Dollar Mystery. Some guy named Leon (Alan Solomon) manages to convince a group of his fellow college students to take part in his latest entertainment, a scavenger hunt called The Game. Five groups of kids will take part; each identified by a specific color, e.g. white, red, yellow, green, and blue. Of course, each group represents a clique on campus. The white team consists of the geeks, led by the always awesome Eddie Deezen in the role of Wesley. The yellow team, better known as the obligatory good guys, consists of Adam (David Naughton), Laura (Debra Clinger), and eventually Adam's little brother Scott (Michael J. Fox). Jocks constitute the green team, lead by Lavitas (Brad Wilkin) and composed of athletes with monikers like Armpit (Curt Ayers). The blue team is the villain of the film, a group of offbeat nuts like Melio (Andy Tennant) and Barf (Brian Frishman) led by the egomaniacal Harold (Stephen Furst). Finally, the red team is the girl team, with the most notable contestants here being two giggly, overweight twins named Lulu and Peggy (Carol Gwynn and Betsy Lynn Thompson respectively). Each group has its own quirky attributes, and all of them despise the other teams. Harold, for instance, can't stand Adam because Harold's father thinks Adam is the archetypical perfect son. When he looks at his own boy, his attitude is summed up in one word: yech.As the game progresses, we see the teams roaming the city while Leon runs the show from his grungy apartment. Clues lead the teams to an observatory, a beer factory, a piano shop, a burger joint, and several other places. Cheating, tricks, and outright hostility mark every leg of the game. Harold, who must win no matter what the cost if he is to retain even a shred of his father's affections, cheats from the get go with a fancy computer that instantly decodes Leon's clues. Problems often threaten to derail the teams, such as a flat tire for the yellows, Peggy and Lulu running off to dance at a disco, and melting marshmallows. Then there are the clues, cryptic messages that mystify the contestants. They more often find the clues through dumb luck than any sort of skill. Look between the two melons, for example, would not offer up an instant answer no matter what the circumstances-unless you're a guy, perhaps. All of the midnight madness takes place firmly within the confines of late '70's and early '80's pop culture. The hyper cheesy disco tune at the beginning, a clue in a video game, and two gals on roller skates wearing tube tops are a good indication that Midnight Madness could not have been made at any other time.The acting is often painful to watch. I can't remember a time I saw facial expressions so overdone. Naughton and Clinger are the worst performers in the film, but even then it's all done in such an innocent way that you tend to forgive their ridiculous overemoting. On the other hand, other actors do a great job. Andy Tennant's Melio is a real hoot, as is Brian Frishman in the iconic role of Barf. Eddie Deezen does dork better than anyone on the planet and he's at the top of his game in this film. Fortunately, the script provides these thespians with the best lines and scenes in cornball celluloid history. Fagabeefe. Hey Melio, Fagabeefe! is a line that should ring from the highest buildings in the land. My absolute favorite scene involves Barf playing that keyboard (Chopsticks, I think?), soon joined by Melio, to the great consternation of Harold. Priceless, just priceless. I don't think I even need to mention the whipsaw fast pace of the movie since any picture about a scavenger hunt will always move at lightning speed.I rented Midnight Madness when I watched it recently, but I really need to buy a copy. My sister, I suspect, doesn't know this movie is out on DVD and would simply love to see it again. Sadly, the disc contains no extras. You can't tell me they couldn't get some of these guys together to do a commentary, especially Michael J. Fox if for no other reason than this was his first film role. Too, the transfer is fullscreen instead of glorious widescreen. Still, I'm not complaining.

18,A15TIGL6MKUWYU,764005553,Mark E. Summers Gamekrazy,"[1, 1]","Any time I sit down to watch this movie, I am always reminded of the first time that I saw it. It was 1986, I was in the Army, stationed at Fort Devens during my AIT, and not having a television of my own, I was in the communal television room watching HBO with some of the other guys. We were sitting around watching television that day when Midnight Madness came on, and from the very beginning, I was hooked. As I said, at that time I didn't have a television or a vcr of my own, but still, I went out and bought a blank tape, and the next time Midnight Madness was on, I recorded myself a copy on the vcr in the communal room until I did get my own. I still have that copy of the movie, and now I'm the proud owner of my own copy of it on dvd. For me, just hearing the opening strands of the Midnight Madness song at the beginning of the movie, and seeing the two cute girls rollerskating are enough to bring a smile to my face. I think back to that first time that I saw the movie, and I have to sit down and watch it all over again. The basic premise of the movie is this: the two girls you see at the beginning of the movie are delivering five invitations inviting five decidedly different people to compete in a game, called the greal allnighter. Once the five captains have accepted the invitation and formed teams, they scour the city, solving clues, leading them from one location to the next, guiding them towards a final goal, whichever team arriving there first being the winner. Of course there are many subplots involved in this: backstabbing amongst the teams, romance brewing, family strife, and other things.Watching the five teams trying to figure out the clues is all a good part of the fun, and the main charm behind the movie, as well as the interaction among the individual members of the teams, and the teams themselves. Adam's team is the most clean cut of them all, being the only team who doesn't really cheat, and the one that I root for, but Harold's team is the most entertaining. Harold, played by Stephen Furst, is a fat slob whose father bullies him into playing the game because he's found out that Adam is playing it. Harold's team consists of a gang of misfits, who cheat at every turn, and cause Adam's team all kinds of problems, but it's hilarious to see it all played out.Wesley, played by the original ubernerd Eddie Deezen, leads one of the other teams, and it's good fun to see his squad of nerds riding around on their mopeds, hamming it up. The last two teams, the jock team, led by Lavitas, and the all girl team, lead by Donna, are probably the least interesting of all of them, but three teams really wouldn't have been enough, so they serve their purpose.I'm not sure why I really like this movie so much, it's not all that original, but still, it never fails to bring a smile to my face, and after all, what more is a movie supposed to do but entertain us. From the music, through the clothing, to the tour of the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer plant, I just love everything about this movie. It was only ever the second movie I had come across that I could watch over a dozen times without getting bored of seeing it. So, I highly recommend this movie, and if you haven't seen it yet, why not?

That's why I fully embrace the &quot;Cult Film&quot; genre, because there are certain films that are classics in their own right but whose appeal truly lies only in the eye of the beholder.&quot;Midnight Madness&quot; is a kitsch film that captures the full disco feel of the late 70's era, but in a lighthearted, inconseqeuential way that doesn't give it the depth of other teen period classics like &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; or &quot;Say Anything&quot;.I found the Amazon review of &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; interesting because it plays up (correctly) the relative innocence of the film. However, in today's PC-saturated culture, I wonder if &quot;Midnight Madness&quot; would be made in the first place. The true humor of the film is how it plays strictly off of high school stereotypes for laughs, where unisex-clad nerds travel on scooters and the football jocks travel in a convertible with the words &quot;Meat Machine&quot; painted on the side.The transcendent (as it were) plot twist of Midnight Madness is that it takes a number of teen stereotypes from across the spectrum and places them in a competetive setting - a scavenger hunt. What follows is complete cornball, where each group has their moment in the sun. The nerds might be able to get the clues at the observatory quickly, but only the jocks know that a certain jingle is the theme for &quot;Pabst Blue Ribbon&quot; beer.It's that type of movie - where everyone acts as you would expect and everyone gets what they deserve. It's done well, though, and that innocence discussed before goes a long way to making it work. It's a well-paced, well-executed piece in the spirit of all those Kurt Russell and Jodie Foster '70's Disney vehicles, but it has just enough of a mature edge that I recommend it for any cult film entusiast, especially fans of films that capture the essence of an era.Oh, and if you're a David Naughton fan, you'll know what drink to have while enjoying the film ;-)",4,I've got a taste for livin....,985564800,"03 26, 2001",0.5039

Robare smurfwreck,"[2, 3]","Midnight Madness starring David Naughton (American Werewolf in London), Stephen Furst (Animal House), Eddie Deezen (default nerd in most 80's media) and a young Michael J. Fox. This film transends bad made-for-TV-80's-teen-comedy and becomes something very wacky and very fun to watch, though it's not strong enough to be a classic.Basic plot? Genius college student Leon has devised the ultimate gaming experience (he's probably a frustrated GM in a D&D; group.) He invites five people (who need to recruit a team) to play the great All Nighter. The game is basically a scavenger hunt for clues around Los Angeles that lead to a final destination. The first group there wins. Hilarity ensues and the movie just becomes one insane madcap romp moment after the next.What holds it back from being a classic is that it's just not quite spot on in terms of how the teams solve the clues and who advances fastest, etc. There is a team of jocks that are solving clues (off camera) that there is no way they could figure out while a bunch of smart spazy nerds are always lagging in fourth place.Among the highlights of the film are Betsy Lynn & Carol Gwynn Thompson, a pair of overweight girls that have the most amazing (yet almost annoying) giggle ever. Just watching them bounce around inthe back of a picup truck, driving scooter bikes, and dancing up a storm at a roller disco are worth the price of admission alone. On top of this you get Michael J. Fox's screen debut as a bratty teen who's always doing someting bad to get his brother's attention. There's also a small cameo from Pee Wee Herman in full pee wee make-up dressed in a cowboy outfit. Oh and did I mention Candy? Well let's just say that the 'C' and 'L' in the word control on her shirt were hiding very provacativly on the sides (ala the Annette reference in Stand By Me.)All in all this is a pretty fun movie, especially considering it came out of Disney (or did Disney buy the rights afterward?), but not quite what it could be.",3,Fagabeefe indeed sir!,1153180800,"07 18, 2006",0.0281

I have actually never ever heard of this movie let alone seen it and I grew up in that era. Anyway nice little discovery. It has that definite 70s vibe to it although it has a make date of 1980. Definitely what America used to be . . . white/black, beauty queens, jocks, nerds, everyday nobodies, etc. Anyway, kinda makes LA seem like a real town. I thought the hunt would take place at touristy locations but instead the clues are hidden at mostly locally known areas real or fictional. But whether made up or actual locally known establishments it gives you a feel that LA was really a town and not a creepy one that sells peoples' souls. This show also kinda has that campy Batman TV show feel to it from the 60s. . . to me. Anyway, I have no idea why Michael J Fox get the headline for this movie as he is a supporting character. But I guess the others are pretty much no bodies. Anyway Fox plays the same character he always plays . . . over the top . . . fake real-acting . . . kinda edgy spastic kid. So don't see it for him.

I haven't laughed so hard in quite a while! What can I say about this movie that you all haven't said so eloquently already? Well, I never saw this on HBO, ever, and we had HBO in the 80s when I was growing up. Where the hell was I??? I first saw this movie in 1987, a few days before I started college in Sacramento,CA. I knew it was bad right from the beginning, but they had so much fun that I began to hope that's what college would be like for me. That lasted one day. But my love for this movie continues, and I have this weird feeling of comraderie with all of you who already know why this is more than just a guilty pleasure. They really don't make movies like this anymore, a fact that only enhances my enjoyment for this film, and others like it (such as 'Scavenger Hunt'). The world that these characters inhabit is oddly attractive to me: cornball, cheesy, dumb, and yet innocent, fun, friendly, and full of adventure. Meelio is the funniest single thing about this movie. Even if I'm in a bad mood and am not laughing at the rest of the movie, he still makes me laugh. I realized I had forgotten how many great lines are in this movie. Three tidbits for the fans: 1-I know exactly where the Johnnie's Fatboy Burger is in LA. Having gone to elementary school there, and spent 2000-2004 there as well, I know the area well. At the corner of Wilshire (just like what's-his-name in the movie says) and Fairfax is an abandoned burger joint called Johnnie Rocket's. The parking lot is the very same way (when I last saw it it 2004) it was when they filmed the movie. Also, the guy who played 'Blade' is still acting and living in LA. I saw him at my work in 2001. I wanted to tell someone I just saw 'Blade' from 'Midnight Madness', but I knew that no one would know what I meant. Lastly, even though he looks 12 years old, Michael J. Fox turned 19 the year this movie was released.

However, in terms of sheer, nostalgic fun and late-night silliness, Midnight Madness is a classic--as the numerous, heartfelt reviews here show.The plot is simple: a mastermind, Leon, stages a Los Angeles-wide scavenger hunt, inviting five captains and their teams to play for everlasting glory. Heralding in the class-consciousness of later '80's movies, there are the White Team (nerds on mopeds); the Green Team (jocks in Meat Machine convertible); Red Team (sorority gals); Blue Team (outcasts in super-van with computer--TRS-80?); and Yellow Team (the good guys). Any bets on the winners?It's low-brow, slapstick, often cheesy and utterly improbable stuff. Yet in its own twisted universe, it _works_. The best thing HBO ever did in its youth was airing this movie practically every day. I don't think I ever watched it from start to finish, but I watched segments so many times that it all came together. Barf and Melio playing the piano; Pabst Blue Ribbon; the Big Boy; MISS!!!!!!!; roller skates; the arcade . . . and of course, the immortal &quot;fagabeefy?&quot;. Almost mindless, but pretty darn clean, especially in light of today's gross-out flicks. (It was Disney's second PG movie, after The Black Hole.)Other amazing tidbits: this was the film debut of both Michael J. Fox and Paul &quot;Pee Wee Herman&quot; Rubens. Stephen Furst (Harold, the leader of the blue team) out-Flounders Flounder, his role in Animal House. The hotel desk clerk, Marvin Kaplan, played Henry on TV's &quot;Alice.&quot; Andy Tennant, the snyde Melio, has gone on to bigger (if not better) things as the director of &quot;Anna and the King&quot; and &quot;Fools Rush In.&quot; He also was a dancer in Grease and a greaser in Grease 2, and he was in &quot;1941&quot; with Barf (Brian Frishman) and the nerd leader (Eddie Deezan, Eugene from Grease).Amazing, isn't it?, that so many threads of trivia should intersect in such an odd place. Glad to see so many share fond memories of this film--and yes, that ultra-groovy, catchy, cheesy title track: &quot;When midnight madness starts to get to you . . .&quot; You've gotta see it to believe it.
