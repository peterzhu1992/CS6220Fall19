So it was quite a delight for me when I stumbled across this movie at Blockbuster. I had no idea they were making Mandie movies. I'm so glad to see it! I thought this movie did a fairly accurate portrayal of Mandie and her kin. I really enjoyed the Cherokee personalities. And I thought Dean Jones as Jason Bond was especially good. Uncle John was well portrayed by a dapper young gentleman. And in essence, the movie was darling and very likeable. The single and only reason I don't rate it a five star movie is because I thought the almost comedic style of acting in the movie detracted from what could have been a very serious and successful story line. Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie.",4,Darling movie.,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",0.3737
2,AHIK7BUXFRMT8,740319183,David Bower,"[1, 1]","The overall impression of this movie is of a very nice movie for children; almost everything about this movie is suitably designed for young children. I have not read the books and watched this one on a hunch. The movie was sufficiently interesting to keep me watching all the way to the end but I would expect many members of the younger audience, pre-teen for example, to enjoy the movie much more.Of the actors only one was familiar and that was Dean Jones and he was also one of the few that didn't specifically look like they were acting.The scenery was beautiful and had some very lovely settings in the woods of North Carolina. The overall ambience of the movie was appropriate for a young audience as well. This is a good solid move for children and I recommend it as such.",4,A Pleasant Family Movie for Children,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",0.5101

4,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,740319183,Harold Wolf Doc,"[1, 1]","No one on the cast/crew need look down for this film adaptation of the essence of the Mandie stories by Lois Gladys Leppard. No film can fully cover a book, but this film begins a series of visual versions of the Mandie adventures which will be remembered by kids as much as the books. And older folk, like me, can enjoy it too. Expect clean dialogue, to major violence (a turkey's dead), and plenty of great scenic Blue Ridge Mountain footage as well as southern mansion elegance. Mandie ends up in her Uncle's estate house, looking for a will, and she and her friends Polly & Joe check out secret passages, rooms, tunnels, and nooks. More passages than Mammoth Cave. There are surprises galore for them, as well as other characters through this story. You really get to feel a part of what is going on in this period tale. Mandie stories are a bit of historic fiction/drama of American late pioneer life.Few Hollywood film makers could create this quality on the budget this group used. And it's Dove approved. That means quality Family Viewing.Some scenes are extended acting, typical when targeting youth, but the story moves quickly. One fun error involved the SUBTITLES (yes SUBTITLES on the feature). When the dialogue was Miss Snow the titles indicated Ms. not Miss, a no-no for 1899. A trivial fault. Dean Jones was wonderful as the estate keeper. There's multi-tasking as Joy Chapman directs, writes, & produces. Owen Smith directs, writes, produces, composes, & cinematography. Several of the cast will reappear in future Mandie movies.I've not read the book, and the film may not be a perfect adaptation of the books, but it should encourage kids to dig into reading more Mandie stories. The film's that good.Also check Amazon's listing for Mandie and the Forgotten Christmas. 5 stars.",5,"Not intended to be the book, but a Mandie story in essence, for youth",1320969600,"11 11, 2011",0.2111

7,A36AXPBGQHZBSS,740319183,Michael Griffith,"[2, 3]","My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's cute, fun, enjoyable, and clean--and also inspiring and moral.Frankly, after reading some of the reviews of the film, I was expecting a movie with awful acting and amateurish production. I saw neither. Oh, the acting isn't Academy-Award quality, but it's not that bad either. Similarly, the production quality isn't at the level of a George Lucas film, but it's not what I'd call amateurish by any stretch. Overall, I thought the acting and the production quality were both pretty good, certainly good enough to make the movie entertaining.This is really a charming, fun movie that the whole family will enjoy. I give it five stars because I love the movie, in spite of its very minor flaws.",5,"Cute, Fun, Enjoyable, and Clean",1293321600,"12 26, 2010",0.4501
8,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,740319183,Midwest Book Review,"[2, 3]","Mandie and the Secret Tunnel is a video for all ages. Based on the best-selling Mandie books by Lois Gladys Leppard, it's set in the late 1800s and revolves around young Mandie Shaw, who just lost her father and sets out to find a new home, assisted by some Cherokee Indian friends. When strangers to a uncle's fortune show up to claim his estate, adventures and dangers evolve. A fine family viewing pick.",5,A fine family viewing pick,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",0.0506
9,ABC8FXLD7W528,740319183,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[6, 7]","Recently, my daughters and I had a girls' night where we invited friends over to watch Mandie and the Secret Tunnel. While I had seen this movie before, I was reminded of what a great movie it is! It is full of adventure, and from what my oldest daughter tells me, very close to the actual Mandie book. It is a family-friendly film with nothing objectionable and combines comedy with heartfelt moments. There was just one scary part at the beginning where little ones will need to hide their eyes while viewing.There are many great discussion points in this movie. For example, the best of friends can often come from unexpected places. Another point: a little compassion and kindness goes a long way, as Mandie discovers from Aunt Lou, Liza, and Jason, when she arrives at Uncle John's house. Thirdly, stealing and deceit never pay, as those looking to steal some of Mandie's inheritance soon discover. Loyalty, forgiveness, and examples of the traits of a loving father also play prominent roles in this movie.I would highly recommend this movie for the entire family, as well as, a girls' night and have added it to my mom-approved listing on my wordpress blog.Reviewed by Penny Zeller, author of the historical romance novel McKenzie.",5,Great Family Film,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",0.4228
10,A26EAPS9DZM2JB,740319183,Quick Reviews,"[0, 1]","Much more than a typical family film, this is the highest quality independent or small studio film I have ever seen. An excellent blend of history, drama, mystery and a touch of humor.The producers used Imagery and Lighting brilliantly, whenever they focused on Mandie during the flashback scenes when the Indian Story was being told.An absolutely outstanding performance was given by Lexi Johnson [who played Mandie, both in this movie and in the first sequel]. Her prior acting experience [all five movies of the Sugar Creek series] can be seen in the attention to detail and nuanced expressions she brought to this role. The entire cast and production also deserve much credit.I totally agree with a previous reviewer who commented the movie was magical!",5,"The Story, Actors and Imagery were Magical",1327190400,"01 22, 2012",0.3564
11,A2I4A4WGWII18Z,740319183,Sunny Sewing Honeybee,"[30, 31]","On my ninth birthday, my mom gave me a book called _Mandie and the Secret Tunnel_. That began decades of faithfully following the series. Sometimes when a favorite book is turned into a movie, there's disappointment that the characters and settings won't be depicted the same as they were pictured when reading. So, while watching the movie, I sat cringing a bit in fear of this happening. By the second half, I could relax, because this movie does Mandie justice and is relatively faithful to the book.Some of the acting isn't spot on, but you can tell everyone is trying and means well--and this isn't meant to be a big-screen release, anyway. The outdoor scenery is beautiful, and the mansion is as expansive and grand as most young readers likely imagine it. The others I watched it with were a bit confused about the mysteries and how everything worked out, though those who have read the book will be able to easily follow the storyline. For others, it may take a couple of viewings to understand how everything weaves together. In fact, in trying to explain the plot a bit, I accidentally gave away part of the mysteries. This is a movie where it's better to just mention the year (1899) and the fact that a girl (changed from pre-teen to 14 in the movie) has lost her father and feels alone in the world . . . and to be patient and let the storyline unfold on its own.The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that as soon as it ended, it said it was made in memory of Lois Gladys Leppard. I hadn't yet heard of her passing, and this sudden flash on the screen caused as much crying for me as the movie did. This dedication is meaningful, but it happens so abruptly after the movie's conclusion that it may shock Mandie fans who don't yet know the news. It might have been better for it to have been at the beginning of the movie or end of the credits.Overall, though, that of course is not enough to dock a star. They don't make wholesome family movies like this anymore . . . but I'm so glad they did.",5,Relatively Faithful to the Mandie Readers Know,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",0.0612
