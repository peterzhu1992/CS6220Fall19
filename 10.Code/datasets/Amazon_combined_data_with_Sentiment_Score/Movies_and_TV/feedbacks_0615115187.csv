Quite the opposite, although only film geeks will get it. A deserving mocking of both David Fincher's pretentious feature and the rules of Dogme 95 (which has produced some breathtakingly stupid, boring, and cliched movies), this is a stone riot.&quot;Lucas In Love&quot; anyone will get, probably as much a tribute to Star Wars' pop cultural presence as anything. It's not mean-spirited or ironic in any way (well, okay, maybe Lucas' &quot;source&quot; for the Force cuts a little closer to the bone than the rest of the gags if you know some Warsies), it's light, simple fun.Definitely this is worth fifteen bucks.

2,A3QPHVR39IMAVC,615115187,David L. White,"[39, 42]","Several reviewers around here really seem to want a lot from a 9 minute film.'George Lucas In Love' was a very fun short. From Lucas' roommate Benji talking about an 'all powerful force' to his friends Hal &amp; Chuck working on Hal's 'fastest thing on campus' to a professor whose speech patterns resembled a well known Jedi Master, this film has a heck of a lot crammed into it's 9 minutes. If anything, the filmmakers should have done a 15-20 minute film! The film was very clever and enjoyable. Maybe just a tad bit funnier than 'Hardware Wars'.The music, cinematography, and acting are all very good, indeed. Anyone who didn't enjoy this at least a little really needs to get a sense of humor. Of course, it's a bit cheesy, but it's meant to be that way. It's presented in the slightly corny, overblown way that 'Hardware Wars' or the 'Naked Gun' films were. The same people who didn't understand those films probably won't understand 'George Lucas In Love'. It's not a 'great' film, but who cares? It's a fun little short by a guy who really loves 'Star Wars'. Some have condemned the filmmakers doing this just for the money. I seriously doubt that Mr. Nussbaum will make a huge fortune from this film and if he does, big deal. Nothing wrong with making money from doing what you love or making money at all. Surely, none of the people who reviewed this film would go and work at their jobs for free and live in a cardboard box under a bridge somewhere! Anyway, GLIL is great fun and a great to watch before your next screening of 'Phantom Menace' or the original trilogy.",5,A very enjoyable 9 minutes..,961459200,"06 20, 2000",0.3372

The plot couldn't be any simpler: George Lucas is tasked with writing his senior film project, a little tinkerer called 'Star Wars' (well, sort of), but he just can't seem to find the inspiration. Along comes a gal who inspires dear old George ... and viola! George Lucas is whisked off on a series of comic scenes that provide him with the background for his epic trilogy of films!A real treat, the DVD comes complete with a director's commentary that also packs in the chuckles.Clearly, this disc is aimed at Star Wars fanatics who know every line and every scene and every nuance from the films, but the passing viewer will get these jokes and be rewarded for journeying ... one more time ... to that galaxy far, far away.",5,You Don't Know What You're Missing ...,1013472000,"02 12, 2002",0.7413

8,A3DE1IYJGU5HPW,615115187,Jason N. Mical,"[6, 6]","George Lucas in Love may very well be the &quot;Form&quot; of a short film - what the perfect short film should be, in a higher realm of understanding. A low-budget, well-shot, beautifully scored, and endlessly engaging piece of work, Joe Nussbaum's clever little feature never falls into film-school pretentiousness or short-film stupidity. Although it is a one-joke premise, the directing and editing manage to keep things moving fast enough that it doesn't get old.The 8-minute short opens with George Lucas, in his last semester at film school, unable to finish his final project, Space Wheat, which begins &quot;Not Long Ago in a Nearby Galaxy.&quot; His teacher (a stubby guy who talks like a certain Jedi Master) is no real help, and it isn't until he meets a girl with hair wrapped tightly in donut-buns (a stunning Lisa Jakob, of Independence Day fame) that he finds a muse who encourages the young Lucas to &quot;write what he knows.&quot; What he knows is the dozens of Star Wars references surrounding him, and the rest, as they say, is history.As much an homage as it is a parody, Lucas in Love succeeds where so many others fail. A review of the three other shorts on the DVD - &quot;Evil Hill&quot; (Dr. Evil meets Notting Hill), Film Club (Fight Club in a film school), and Swing Blade (Sling Blade mixed with Swingers) easily demonstrates how this type of experiment can fall flat on its face, turning into a gigglefest by filmmakers and audiences with the kinds of noses that stick up in the air. Thankfully, Lucas in Love is never reduced to this insipid level of &quot;didja get it? didja? aren't we CLEVER!!!) that the other films on the DVD do (and, unfortunately, so many other short films available on the Internet).The DVD features a commentary track by the director and producer, which reveals little about the film (there isn't much time in an 8 minute session), but there is a &quot;making of&quot; that actually lasts longer than the film itself - perhaps a first in DVD history - that has all the major players and some great behind-the-scenes stuff. The real gem is a pop-up video version of the film that shows you all the Star Wars references - chances are, unless you are the most obsessed fan out there, you missed at least one. There is also a secret code area where you can enter a numeric code you get from mediatrip.com, makers of this DVD. Considering mediatrip.com is now defunct, I don't feel bad saying that the code is 1138 (as in THX-1138, one of Lucas' early films) and that the secret is a short clip of the director showing off his letter from George Lucas congratulating him on the film.Is it worth the money for this DVD? Up to you. Basically, it's a question of how big of a Star Wars fan you are. You can download the film from several places on the net, and the SciFi channel runs it every now and then, but if you want the interviews and a crystal-clear transfer, then it's probably worth it. Besides, it's great to roll out for your friends and show them without boring them.",5,Wow and Wow Again!,999388800,"09 2, 2001",0.2135

The character swaps keep the humor moving, yet the nice production gives the film a professional gloss.For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD, the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well! &quot;Evil Hill&quot; and &quot;Swingers&quot; are slightly less affective than the feature, but very funny nonetheless. &quot;Film Club&quot; was just. . . silly!

Fans of Shakespeare in Love will roll when they see this movie, for the simple fact that they will pick up many of the subtleties of humor that us &quot;just plain&quot; Star Wars fans would probably miss.For my own part, after reading the reviews of this movie when in first came out, I went to the website and watched the movie online before I bought it. The blatant Star Wars allusions -- from the asthmatic rival, to the not-so-subtle background action -- are absolutely hysterical, but I knew that I was missing something. That night, I went to the video store and rented SIL just so I could understand what it had to do with the parody. I can now say with absolute assurance that if you're a fan of both films, George Lucas in Love will probably be the best parody you will ever see!Oh... one more thing -- if you watched this movie on the Web and thought it was hilarious, I would still encourage you to buy it.

George Lucas has writer's block at the worst possible time, he needs a script to pass film school! Inspiration is gone and he must find his muse to get the creative juices flowing again. Fortunately, the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot; is all about him, he only needs to open his eyes and see it.The only problem with this short - is that it is too short.

I'm sure it's a fine movie, but what &quot;George Lucas in Love&quot; accomplished in only 10 minutes surely can't be improved over the course of a 2-hour movie (perhaps I'm also still bitter that it beat &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; for best picture of 1998.. grrrrr). That little rant aside, Star Wars is probably the most frequently spoofed movie or cultural phenomenon of all time (with Star Trek running a close second). This current incarnation takes its inspiration from &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; and finds a college-age George Lucas struggling to find his inspiration to write an 'agricultural space opera' for his final project. As he walks across campus to meet with his advisor, you see many quirky schoolmates who seem to have inspired different characters and plots in Star Wars, from Han Solo to Jabba the Hutt. Even his advisor engages in the backward speak that defines Yoda. George finds his inspiration in the form of an attractive co-ed who's hairstyle seems vaguely familiar. There is even a little twist that romance that I dare not mention.

Eh... My friends have made more effective nine minute movies, but it's not hard to understand why this film sells so well -- there's an endless supply of mythology for devotees of &quot;Star Wars,&quot; and this movie exposes it, if not skillfully, at least blatantly. Few of the so-called &quot;inspiration&quot; shots really work well -- Obi-Wan and Jabba work because they're more subtle. The Darth Vader and R2D2/C3PO ones stretch for believability -- I know there's weirdos at any university at any time, but these caricatures try a little too hard as written (if what I'm writing doesn't make sense, it's because I'm trying to not give the movie away). Really good filmmakers (and remember that Nussbaum is still new at this) don't pander in such obvious ways.
