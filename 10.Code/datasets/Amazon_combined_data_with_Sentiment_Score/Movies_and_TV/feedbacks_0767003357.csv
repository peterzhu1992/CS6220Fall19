He was far more blustery than smoldering, and the scene at which he screamed at Jane while she drove away disturbed me. He seemed more like an abusive boyfriend than a man overwhelmed with pain and passion.Also, some of my favorite scenes were cut. Where was the scene where Jane went home to visit her family? She left and then came back again; we saw no part of her interaction with the Reeds, which was one of the best parts in the book. She also never learned of the inheritance left to her by her uncle in Madeira.

I did find the language and liberties taken with some scenes unfortunate - I am not against modifying dialogue to help the flow of the movie, but too many liberties were taken here! That being said, I really, really enjoyed this movie.

One of my friends, who is no fan of the book or the other film versions, commented that she got the characters for the first time when she caught a rerun on A&E and I'd have to agree. The essence of Jane and Rochester is all here: Passion. It's restrained in plain and little Jane, who inside is all rebelliousness, and smoldering in Rochester, who here is just as gruff and domineering and bad-tempered as he ought to be. Watching this film I can believe that this version of Rochester and Jane are passionately in love with one another.

For instance, it completely skips Jane's conversation with her Aunt Reed when her aunt is on her deathbed.(2) The acting is not as good as might be desired. The actors playing Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester just do not have the correct chemisty. (Disclaimer: I must admit that I always liked Timothy Dalton's performance in the 1983 BBC version, so my judgement might be impaired)(3) The film does not develop the relationship between Jane and St. John Rivers nearly as much as it should have. Hence, it might be difficult for the viewer who has not read the novel to realize what a difficult choice Jane must make when she decides to refuse St. John's offer.I recommend the following:(1) Jane Eyre (1983) with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke - a BBC production totaling 311 minutes(2) Jane Eyre (2006) with Ruth Wilson (II); Toby Stephens - a Masterpiece Theatre production totaling 228 minutesNote:However, I enjoyed this version more than the Jane Eyre (2003) Miramax production with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg.",3,Not the Best Version...Not the Worst,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",0.1444

In the book, his evil deeds are swept away by the force of his personality and the depth of his love.

If you want to see Ciaran Hinds in a wonderful movie, see Jane Austen's Persuasion.Samantha Morton, although a great actress here, played Jane far too impertinent for her position, the era and most importantly for the post-Helen Jane who had a gentle spirit that made Mr. Rochester drawn to her in the first place.I was glad to see the Bertha portrayal was very close to the book in this one as well as the 83' version. Unlike, the most recent Masterpiece version that had Bertha looking like she could step out of Thornfield, put on a gown and walk the red carpet.If you want to see a great and TRUE adaptation of Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, watch the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version which still is powerful even after 24 years. Timothy Dalton is the book's tumultous, playful, introspective and passionate Mr. Rochester.

I infinitely prefer the William Hurt adaptation of the novel.First off, the film quality and color of this film were very poor. It was washed out and altogether too bland. Also, the acting was poor in my opinion. Samantha Morton was not very believable as Jane Eyre and the actor who plays Mr. Rochester was altogether unappealing. The two actors had no spark or chemistry to speak of, and the relation of love by Mr. Rochester later in the film is wholly unbelievable and poorly delivered. He ruins one of the best lines in the novel (the one with the bit of string tied to his heart and Jane's). Also, although Mr. Rochester is not handsome, this actor was just uglier than I had imagined Mr. Rochester to be. But, that would be of little account if he also did not portray Mr. Rochester as just plain rude. He ordered about Jane in a brutish manner, levied insults, barked out his lines and was very dull. Why Jane would be attracted to him (beyond being lonely and not having the company of any other man) is beyond me. The portryal of Jane was also a dull one and her constant voice overs were really annoying. A film is supposed to show us the story, not tell us the story. There was far too much telling of Jane felt or about her past, and far too little demonstration. I was told Jane loved Mr. Rochester, but from watching the film I found that very hard to believe. Jane also seemed to be rude and disrespectful on purpose, rather than observant and forthright as she is in the novel. She doesn't mean to offend, but truthfully answers questions and speaks her mind. The movie would have you think she is just catty. Also, she always looks so annoyed with Mr. Rochester.Overall, I regret buying this film.

He got so wild when Jane bewitched his horse that I thought he was going to take his wife's place in the attic. So over-the-top was his rough exterior that his passionate scenes with Jane at first evoked from me hearty laughter, which I don't think was the intended effect. She'd never like a guy like that, and he'd...well. I just wasn't seeing it. At first.So why the five star rating? Because this is a difficult movie to get right. It's not five stars for perfection, but five stars for being far and away the best adaptation of the four I've seen so far.It spares you lengthy portrayals of the scenes where a little goes a long way (Lowood, also the Auntie's stewardship of Jane, etc.) and instead saves the film for scenes that really need to be developed carefully in order for the lengthy novel to be credible onscreen. That is, Rochester and Jane need time to grow in their relationship. Some adaptations try to rush it and you see Jane falling in love with a crazy, irate cooky guy who explores his deepest affect, out loud and rather distastefully, to what appears onscreen to be a complete stranger not ridiculously fond of him. This version was a very nice effort, but there was one part a bit rushed-her missing him after she simply tells us they had more talks together. A minor detail. Her portrayal was very good and real. Compare it to the 1996 version (Hurt/Gainsbourg) where Rochester comments to Jane about the tears ready to come into her eyes. This is after Jane is forced to watch Rochester with the new chick on the block. Then he says, or do I see them there now? Problem is, she doesn't look at all like she's upset or about to cry, or even depressed, although perhaps disappointed and maybe slightly wounded. Under these circumstances, Rochester's assessment makes him look self-important, sadistic and weird.Although, in this version (1997) I think Jane gets too passionate too soon, before Rochester has begun much transformation and become truly transparent and honest which I think took a bit away from the credibility. Then again, Jane comes from Lowood.Bottom line: For delicate, complex development, sensitive performances, and for sparing us the stuff we don't need much of in favor of the parts that need the time to develop, I give it five.

He was very close to how I imagined Mr. Rochester in the book. Not handsome but rugged and likeable.

I enjoyed the rapid transitions, cut-aways and voice overs. It tells the story of the novel in a most interesting way.I think Samantha Morton makes an excellent Jane Eyre. She really captures Jane's innocent yet vibrantly alive spirit. Morton exudes the very fairy-like, impish qualities that Mr. Rochester is always describing her as having in the book. I think she is the best Jane I have see portrayed although I do enjoy Charlotte Gainesborough's and Joan Fontaine's work as Jane as well.Ciran Hinds did equally as well. I think the two actors really displayed the chemistry that existed potently between Jane and Rochester. This kiss under the tree was remarkable!The settings and lighting in this version are much better than in the 1983 Timothy Dalton version. And although Hinds is quite handsome in Persuasion, he actually becomes the more unattractive Rochester in this movie.

I have to say, though, that this version was a terrible disappointment, not only because of the time-constrained abridgement of the text, but because of the portrayals of the lead characters. In particular, the actor playing Mr. Rochester portrayed him as a TOO angry, sneering, ranting, bellicose, offensive man. (I don't know whether I should blame the actor or the director). It was just asking too much of the viewer to believe that Jane could find any redeeming qualities in him at all, let alone fall hopelessly in love with him!The most accurate and well-acted version of this wonderful book, in my opinion, is the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke version. (It AMAZED me that someone actually found fault with this production because that viewer thought that they took TOO MUCH script, verbatim, from the book)! One of the most positive attributes of the Dalton/Clarke version is that they remained true to Miss Bronte's &quot;script,&quot; and the performances, right down through the supporting cast, were absolutely superb!

Wouldn't Charlotte Bronte be appalled!It all starts out well enough, capturing the horrors of the red room episode, and Jane's experiences at Lowood acceptably. It is indeed, in some places, more detailed than my favorite version(Orson Wells/Joan Fontain) could be in 1944, with a running time of about an hour and a half.But then, everything falls apart when Jane and Rochester meet, and Ciaran Hinds delivers his first horridly overdone speech. There is absolutely no chemistry between the characters; Jane, as played by the lovely bright-eyed Samantha Morton is fiesty, fights back at Rocheter's rudeness(can you blame her?)and doesn't seem to relish the fact that she's supposed to fall in love with Hinds(who can blame her there, either?)who is mean, whiny, and creepy by turns.Don't look for the romantically poetic speeches, and heart-stopping presence of the eternally excellent Orson Wells, here. Nor the Mild and admirable Jane, who makes Rochester forget his wretched past.Morton and Hinds either shout or whisper their thoroughly unoriginal and sometimes exceptionally bad diolouge. Especially Hinds, who never stops yelling at Jane, who stands there looking mildly annoyed at her own role.In the book, and in the Orson Wells/Joan Fantain version, Rochester was troubled, a little moody, and at first very commanding, but after first meeting ever gentle and believably facsinated by and endeared to Jane's originality.It was obvious and convincing why she fell in love with him. In this version, you have to wonder what would make her love this ugly, creepy, angry old man!There are two scenes which are particularly bad. First, one in which Jane and Rochester go shopping in Milcote the day after their engagement, and meet who else? But Blanche Ingram! looking decidedly middle class and out of place. then ensues a very odd conversation in which Blanche looks slightly disconcerted as Rochester boasts of his coming marriage to The governess,while Jane stands by looking very pleased with herself. after walking away from Blanche, Jane laughs when Rochester jokes about how he used Blanche to make her jeolous. Ha, ha, ha! clever!The second, if not showing quite as poor judgement and irreverence for the novel, at least makes up for in awkwardness.In the scene where the wedding is interupted by Rochester's brother in law,(followed by the most bratty tantrum yet seen, by Hinds), he takes them up to see his wife. the whole group; jane, Mason, the vicar, and Mrs. Fairfax stand by looking very uncomfortable as Rochester stomps about the madwoman's cell, ranting about how he was tricked into marriage with bertha Mason(a scene which was done with much more class and convincing anguish by Orson Wells)Just when you think this scene can't get any weirder, Rochester suddenly embraces the sobbing Bertha and plants several kisses on the top of her frizzled head. I say lets throw him in there too.In the scene where Jane leaves, Rochester yells some more, accusing her of only wanting him for his money. it all culminates in her departure, only to meet St. John(cheerful, complacent - compare him with the St. John in the book)who's marriage proposal drives her back to Rochester, in which they exchange this annoyingly sarcastic, and un-Bronte speech:So you didn't find anyone else to marry you? sneers Rochester.I found someone who wanted to marry me. again, the self-satisfied smile.Good lord! some advice: rent or buy either the 1944 or 1996(?)versions and enjoy those.",1,"Do you approve Mrs. Fairfax?

Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen's Sweet and Lowdown, Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face, by her impressive and speaking eyes alone. It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length, but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel's two main characters and their relationship. Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book. The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds. Hinds is a talented, intense actor but I can't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester's character. Some his scenes in the film made me cringe. Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much.

First, the writers took great 'liberties' with the novel that detract, rather than enhance, the characters. The best two examples involve the main characters of Mr. Rochester and Jane. In the book, Rochester is a brooding, singular figure who is very much a victim of the cruel plotting and vices of others. But in this film version, he is cruel and vindictive in and of himself. Vengeful, plotting, and profane, you have little reason to see why Jane would ever attach herself to such a worthless creature. Jane of course does fall in love with him, but because he is so repugnant, the viewer can hardly see any reason why. Thus, Jane is herself reduced greatly from a woman who loves unconditionally - -as was shown in the book- -to a strange, misguided young woman racked with a codependent psyche. The second area in which this version is inferior to the book, and the other far superior film versions (particularly the William Hurt version) is its brevity. It is only 90 minutes long. It leaves out so many of the small aspects that would normally give vitality and life to the characters. Being that it is such a poor version, this is not necessarily all that bad, but willing to give the film chance after chance to redeem itself, it falls terribly short on nearly every measure.",2,Definitely the Worst of the TV/Movie Adaptions,1041897600,"01 7, 2003",-0.0064

41,AQ5NFBZYOHNQ6,767003357,JB bookworm,"[16, 18]","This 1997 TV production is called Jane Eyre, but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront's literary masterpiece. How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot, who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me, but they did. This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciar&agrave;n Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation. Samantha Morton - young, delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre, but does not play Jane Eyre. Her Jane is far too bold, even disrespectful at times, self-confident and self-satisfied, bossy and pert. Gone is the interesting duality of Jane's character in the novel, her outward shyness, guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other. Morton's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film. There is no subtlety in her performance, her Jane undergoes no change and no development. The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester. Believe it or not, but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully. Luckily Ciar&agrave;n Hinds possesses some charisma, but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel. Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester's character, his many contradicting facets, his moodiness, his inner struggle, his humour and his tenderness. The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times, but never the unrefined, snarling brute Ciar&agrave;n Hinds makes him. Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester, and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles: Blanche, besides being blonde, is not in the least haughty enough, not to mention the fact that she is nice to Ad&egrave;le, St. John is all smiles and kindness, and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up, probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones. Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience. The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter's own banal lines. In either case they have lost all the charm, sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel. Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words: I know it may sound silly but.... No, Mr. Hawley, if somebody sounds silly here, it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront'! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding, a scene, by the by, which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment. Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Jane, the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront's Rochester. What? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay? Absolutely ridiculous! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.This is the worst, but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous: the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook, Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic's room to sniff at Mason's wounds like a wild beast, Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.Equally lamentable is the filmmakers' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies. Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot. Sentences like I feel that your passions are aroused are appropriate for Sex in the City, but not for a costume drama, let alone Jane Eyre. Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel, nor about portraying the novel's era accurately. The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre. The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006.",1,At least they got Pilot right!,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",0.0632

However, this was mainly attributed to improper screenplay and direction and the lack of chemistry between the two lead characters.After seeing Ciaran Hinds' brilliant performance in `Ivanhoe' and `Persuasion', I had to watch this version. However, I was quite disppointed as he portrays a rather savage, arrogant and simple Mr Rochester and fails to depict the absolute complexity and glamour of Bronte's character as others have mentioned in their reviews. For this I solely blame the directors though, for Hinds' undoubtedly has the capacity to provoke the audience in the same manner that Bronte's Mr Rochester does the reader ( - evidence from his numerous awesome performances clearly suggest so).Samantha Morton is undeniably my favourite Jane though. She is far more vivacious and yet more solemn than Zelah Clarke and exudes much more passion than Charlotte Gainsbourgh (but for that I also blame misguided direction &amp; screenplay engineered by Zeffirelly &amp; Whitemore).

While this version (A&amp;E's) of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; sticks to the basic plot, much better than the William Hurt version does, the screenwriters got the characters all wrong. In this version, Jane is much too forceful; she never would have spoken rudely to her employer as she does in this movie. She could barely look him in the eye, much less call him a liar to his face, as she basically does.After seeing A&amp;E's &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; which was absolutley wonderful, I really would have expected more from them.

53,A2AVOVUTRTABTX,767003357,K. Schrecker KJS,"[2, 3]","I love Charlotte Bronte's novel, Jane Eyre, and I've read it several times. Also an avid movie fan, I have seen almost every production of Jane Eyre. I have to admit, being a classic movie lover, I still place the Orson Wells/Joan Fontaine version first among them all, and not because it was absolutely true to the novel, but because it was the most successful of all versions in creating the gothic mood of the Bronte novel in the grand Hollywood manner. Of course, it also had Orson Wells, whose masterful portrayal of Rochester gave the character such depth and mystery as to forever seal the part in his name.However, this version starring Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton is my second favorite for several reasons. First, the casting was perfect. Ciaran Hinds does a wonderful job portraying Edward Rochester, a complex, authoritative and tortured man who is hiding a horrible secret. He is supposed to be almost 20 years older than Jane and not overly handsome--although not as moody and dark as Orson wells, he gives the character more humor and fits the bill admirably. Samantha Morton is simply fantastic as Jane Eyre. She is my favorite of all the female leads to date. She is not as pretty as Joan Fontaine or Mia Wasikowska, but she is attractive enough to be pleasant to watch. (Jane is supposed to be plain.) Her Jane has much more personality compared to other actresses who have played the part. She gives us a strong, confident Jane while showing us enough warmth to make her sympathetic to the viewer. She is Jane Eyre in my eyes. The two leads have one thing that many other versions do not--fantastic chemistry!!! Together, they sizzle on the screen, which is something you would not expect from these two as a couple.The production is fantastic, as is the photography and script adaptation. I have only two beefs with this production--first, the actress playing Adele was too old and rather irritating. Second, I absolutely hate the singing voice they dubbed in for Edward/Ciaran--that high, operatic tenor just didn't seem like it could come out of his throat. If they could have fixed those two things, this would have been the perfect version.As for the other versions I have seen, I'll list them here in my order of preference with a quick review:3) 2011 Version with Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fessbender: My third favorite; major problems include Mia being way too pretty to play Jane, and she needed a bit more personality. Michael Fessbender was admirable as Rochester, but he physically did not fit the part--too handsome and too blonde. Rochester was always referred to being dark, mysterious with black hair and eyes--hard to get past that part, but he is a sexy man.4) 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens: Non-descript actors, but a decent production. Except for one hot scene with Jane and Edward on the bed (which would NEVER have happened in the novel), sort of forgettable.5) 1971 Version with George C. Scott and Susannah York: Miscast; both leads were too old for the parts--so/so version, nothing too much going on here.6) 2003 Version with Willian Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg: I like Willian Hurt, but I hated him in this part. Too blonde, too cold, no mystery here. Charlotte Gainsbourg was painfully plain with NO personality. This was as dry as toast and uninteresting with little to hold your attention. NO chemistry between the two leads--absolutely none.7) BBC Version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke: There is a good thing and a bad thing about this version and they both are Timothy Dalton! He is WAY TOO HANDSOME to play Edward. There is a part in this version where Edward asks Jane, Do you find me handsome? and she answers No. What a laugh! Timothy Dalton is pure eye candy. No one could get past this without laughing. He was horribly miscast as the brooding and mysterious Edward. On the plus side, he is the only good thing about this production! His acting holds the whole thing together--the actress they have playing Jane has as much personality as a pet rock. Not attractive, which isn't a major problem because Jane is supposed to be rather plain, she should have at least SOME qualities to make her feasibly attractive to the fantastically handsome Timothy Dalton. In real life, Ol' Tim wouldn't have looked twice in her direction. Also, her acting was wooden, and she had this horrible pimple or wart on her face that kept moving about in different scenes--it drove me crazy. So, after seeing the rather lack-luster Jane, Timothy Dalton is the entire production. It is a dated and small production; hard to watch after viewing the other movie versions--but I do realize that this was an early made for TV/BBC production so you can't expect much. I know many will call me out for trashing their beloved BBC production, but I have to call it as I see it.",5,One of the BEST!,1350518400,"10 18, 2012",0.1834

One need only view various interpretations, such as the 1944 Orson Welles film, starring both himself and Joan Fontaine, to appreciate this 1997 version. Twentieth Century Fox's wartime genre encapsulates the studio art department with very poorly executed visuals in the 1944 film. One knows without doubt that this was made in Hollywood.However, each version is different, with different characterizations,style and pace. This 1997 original A & E version is good stylistically, the lead characters give earnest interpretations, but seem a bit caricatured and one-dimensional.I have read the various reviews praising the Timothy Dalton version and cannot for the life of me understand the praise. He is entirely too wooden and one-dimensional. One does not even perceive the character of Rochester, with its depths and nuances, in his portrayal.The best film Jane Eyre thus far, in my opinion, is the BBC 1973 version with Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston, also available through Amazon.com.

Scott/Susannah York version of Jane Eyre, the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson version of Jane Eyre and the Ciaran Hinds/Samantha Morton version of Jane Eyre--yes, it's one of my favorite movies. Without a doubt, Ciaran Hinds' portrayal of Rochester is head and shoulders above Timothy Dalton as well as Toby Stephens. I do like Toby Stephens but Ciaran Hinds' facial expressions, his emotional portrayal of Rochester is unparalleled. Samantha Morton is a wonderful Jane, plain yet with an inner beauty, stoic and strong, unemotional on the surface but in love with Mr. Rochester. She was the ideal actress for this role. I was very disappointed with the portrayal of Jane in the Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version, for one thing Zelah Clark is so short compared to Dalton, I couldn't watch the movie without thinking she looked like a child in height yet older in her face than Dalton--it was very distracting for me. She also does not have the range of acting and emotion Samantha Morton gives in her performance--Clark is very bland compared to Morton. As much as I like Timothy Dalton, he isn't Rochester. The George C. Scott/Susannah York version is good, I really liked George C. Scott as Rochester but not as much as Hinds. Susannah York comes closer to Samantha Morton as Jane than any of the other versions but Samantha Morton still excels in this part..There are many comments about the Hinda/Morton version not closely following the book, I was more interested in the movie than the book, if I purely wanted the book, I would read that and not watch the movie. I've seen the Hinds/Morton Jane Eyre many times, each time I see more and more pure acting ability from Hinds than any other actor in this role, his facial expressions portray as much as his spoken lines. Hinds in excellent in portraying the gruffness and hard edge of Rochester yet tenderness in his passion and love for Jane--Hinds brings Rochester to life. The last scenes of this movie with Hinds' and Morton's recital of love and devotion for each other are nothing short of astounding. Hinds' tears were real as he poured out his heart to Jane that he was no longer worthy of her, how could she love him now as a wounded blind man unable to care for her--amazing acting on Hinds' part. The same was true for Morton as Jane, her tears flowed easily and with such realism as she promised to never leave him again, she had returned to him forever.Of the other versions of Jane Eyre, Toby Stephens as Rochester would be my next choice, even over Scott, but as good as he is, Stephens honestly doesn't hold a candle to Hinds as Rochester. I particularly missed the passion and pure emotion in the last scenes with Stephens and Wilson, it was weak compared to Hinds and Morton. If I want authenticity, perhaps I'll go to the Stephens/Wilson version, for pure enjoyment and richness of acting in a love story, it's Hinds and Morton hands down.

Wentworth (and many other roles) but as Rochester all he does is shout and bellow his way thru the story. His Rochester is entirely one-note, a very shallow performance on his part -- there's no dimension, no spark, no inner life. He seems to have viewed the role as just a cliched cartoonish gothic hero - he doesn't approach the character with any seriousness. Morton is equally shallow in the role - neither actor seems to have taken their characters seriously.

79,A1MUP3BTU5XSAL,767003357,Spider Wood,"[6, 9]","When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson's Jane Eyre movie, they had to leave everything out that couldn't be condensed. The mini-series approach, however, allows ample time to study the characters in depth. In my 29 years, I recall not one, but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s. These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience. I won't judge which of the two is more definitive, having only read part of the book.The 1983 one, released to VHS/DVD, starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane, mistreated by her aunt Reed's family and at Lowood school. This is the first hour of the series, and I was riveted. When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives, Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The series is excellent, almost to the point where I'd call it treachery that it's not available either on VHS or DVD. This was no minor production: in fact, it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.Dalton's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious, almost a caricature. It's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion. Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side, but balances sardonic wit with what's been called a poetic imagination. Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane. You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role. His enthusiasm for the part is obvious. Clarke's Jane is plain, and seeks independence, love and servitude, but it's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from. It's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking, although that may be. Cusack, an Irish actress, is irresistable in more ways than one. A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate, she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester, trading jabs, despite the difference in age and experience. Thus, in the early scenes, we get a good sense of Jane Eyre's spiritedness (even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood). The interaction of Dalton and Clarke, while fine, falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.Other things to note: the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK. The memorable theme music was the passionate Introduction and Allegro composed by one of Britain's greatest, Sir Edward Elgar. My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft, the screenwriter, Robin Chapman, and to the cast: Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Fairfax), Stephanie Beacham (Blanche Ingram), Geoffrey Whitehead (St. John Rivers), Susan Brodrick (Mary Rivers), Caroline Harris (Diana Rivers), Edward De Souza (Richard Mason), and the rest.It's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them. Jane Eyre is a classic novel. Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale. In fact, it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale, now. Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of Jane Eyre is not bad, and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.If you write to the powers-that-be, BBC America or BBC Worldwide, they'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release. Go ahead and give it a try. Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.There is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found. Look online also for an image of the Radio Times cover that announced the original broadcast.",2,"Not bad for a movie, but try one of the mini-series",1106352000,"01 22, 2005",0.1962

I agree with one reviewer who disliked Ciaran Hinds' overacting as Mr. Rochester. However, I'm interested in this version because of him, and Samantha Morton.Samantha is amazing to me here, as she, if you can believe it, also plays timid little Harriet Smith in Jane Austen's Emma (A&E; version). What a difference in personality and character!! And so convincing!And Ciaran Hinds plays Wentworth in Jane Austen's Persuasion with Amanda Root as Anne, and of course, he's nothing like Mr. Rochester.Both Emma and Persuasion mentioned above have sub-titles.

I highly recommend this movie, I liked this version of Jane Eyre very much!

This is the only Jane Eyre version I would never own or buy or even want as gift. The acting was mediocre,not one of the best. Even the latest version that came out this year,that I thought was 'ok', was 100 times better than this one. I don't know why this actor Ciaran Hinds was picked to play Rochester. I spent the entire movie wondering what Jane saw in him. He was neither attractive nor charming in any way or likeable. I can't find anything good to say about his portrayal or this version. I was not able to sympathize with him at all. I thought either Orson Wells or William Hurt were the worst as Rochester but I could not be more wrong. I can not think of a worse actor to play Rochester than this man. I didn't care much for this actress as Jane either or Adele. I think the dog Pilot was the best actor in this movie.

I thought that was perfect casting and that I would see something of the caliber of &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot; I was bitterly disappointed! What a travesty!My main objection is that the scriptwriter decided she could improve on Charlotte Bronte. Instead of sticking to the words in the book as closely as possible, she completely rewrote the dialogue. What arrogance! The result is that both Rochester and Jane say things that are completely out of character to anyone that's read the book. &quot;I feel your passions are aroused&quot;? I found myself screaming at the screen &quot;he'd never say that!&quot;My second main objection was how Ciaran Hinds was directed to play Rochester. I blame the director because I've seen Hinds in many movies and know the range of emotion he can display. In this version he was essentially one-note: he shouts all the time. The ONLY time he softens is in the bedroom with Jane after the fire. That one scene showed me what could have been, and only sharpened my disappointment with the rest. What a sad waste of what could have been a marvelous production.I did like Samantha Morton's Jane best of all the Janes (I've seen every version of this). I just wish she'd been given better dialogue to speak.The Timothy Dalton version remains my favorite.

I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy.Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking, or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet.

Despite seeing scores of negative reviews here, I thought to myself--it can't possibly be that bad. It was made back in A&E;'s classics heyday. [Remember when A&E; once stood for Arts & Entertainment? But I diverge.] It's stars Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton. It's Jane Eyre! How could it possibly be mucked up?Despite having everything going for it, this version doesn't live up to expectations. There are several reasons for this:~The atmosphere. You won't feel submerged in Jane's world. The sets and costumes look cheap. What is more, the gothic touches are missing. For example, the red room sequence. The camera just flashes around the room-but it doesn't show us the shadows, the things Jane imagines, that make her scared. It's just a room.~the script. JE is dense book so not everything is going to be able to be packed in a two hour movie but too much was left out of this movie. Where is the gypsy scene? Where is Jane's discovery that she is not solely an orphan but has family? Where's Jane's conversations with Mrs. Reed when she returns home? Even on a basic level, the script suffers--rather than develop plot points, it just jumps to them as the story requires. For example, the St. John sequence is too short. The Blanche Ingram sequence is especially undeveloped.~the acting. Samantha Morton is the saving grace of this production. Her Jane is gentle but formidable, quiet but with a backbone. Ciaran Hinds is not a one-note actor, but as Mr. Rochester, he is only shown as being agitated, spiteful and mean. Even when he is kind, he is cruel. Jane would never fall in love with this Rochester.At times, it also feels like a parody. The parody elements particularly come through in the handling of Bertha Rochester. It's like watching a Monty Python sketch when she's onscreen.In short, this is a dud! It's worth watching in order to be able the appreciate how good the 06 version is. Also, if you are in the know about BBC programs, it can amusing to watch just to see the once and future Captain Wentworths both featured in the same production.

This is just a critique on this version of JE. I've seen the others, and this version isn't bad, it's hilarious.I've never laughed so hard at an adaption which is supposed to be a tragic but uplifting love story. Oh, let me count the ways.... First, the Jane Eyre character, played by Samantha Morton. I thought she appeared to be a bit of a vindictive, spiteful, co-dependent girl. She is a Heather in Victorian dress. However, I think she was the perfect for this version of Mr. Rochester. Oh boy.....I LOVE Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, I love his range, his voice, it's a doggone shame that the scriptwriter, director made his character laughable. Yes, his mannerisms are cringeworthy, and his 'attraction' for Jane, bordered on sexual harassment. The character's lust for life, and vigor appeared to be a bipolar disorder.The part that made spit out my water at the TV screen, the scene after he and Jane first shared a passionate kiss. After we hear Jane narrate how she imagined the kiss or that moment, here comes Mr. Rochester. Jane addresses him as Mr. Rochester, and he has an expression of perverted that only Austin Powers could love. He whispers, Edward. I was waiting for him to wink, wink, nudge, nudge and wiggle his eyebrows.If you're down in the dumps, this version will make you shake your head and perhaps laugh it off.",2,Mr. Rochester AKA Austin Powers..................,1135987200,"12 31, 2005",0.2689
92,A1POFVVXUZR3IQ,767003357,Z Hayes,"[2, 2]","I am puzzled as to why the director, producers, and writers of this so-called adaptation of Jane Eyre decided to stray so far from the actual novel by Charlotte Bront. Not only were several key scenes deleted, they chose to put in words and scenes that were never in the book. So why did I give it a three-star rating? Well, this is because of the wonderful acting by the main characters.Samantha Morton, whose luminous beauty is portrayed subtly here, plays plain Jane Eyre, whose intellect and high moral character is wonderfully and credibly depicted here. Mr. Rochester is played by the consummate Ciaran Hinds who first impressed me in his performance as the lead character inThe Mayor of Casterbridgeand who delivered a finely nuanced performance as the once thwarted in love Captain Frederick Wentworth inPersuasion. Both actors deliver credible, compelling performances and the age gap is certainly true to the novel, though many of the dialogue and scenes may not. The chemistry is believable, though not the best of all the adaptations.If you watch closely, you'll recognize several other familiar faces in British period drama. The wonderful Gemma Jones fromThe Duchess of Duke Street - The Complete CollectionandSense And Sensibilityas Mrs. Fairfax, Elizabeth Garvie from 1980'sPride and Prejudice: The Complete BBC Miniseries [VHS] as Diana Rivers, and Rupert Penry-Jones ofWhite Chapel: The Ripper Returnsas St. John Rivers.The cinematography is beautiful enough though the score is forgettable, and ultimately, I would rate this as one of the weakest adaptations of Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre. That being said, I would still recommend watching it if you're a fan of Hinds and Morton and also if only to do some comparisons with other adaptations.",3,Far from faithful adaptation but great casting and acting,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",0.3442
