Working out to exercise video tapes takes commitment with alternative workouts. She teamed up with martial arts expert Keith Cooke, and five-time grand champion at U.S. World and U.S. Open Karate Tournaments and a member of the Black Belt Hall of Fame.This isn't difficult, and with some practice and repetition, And the setting ISN'T your typical aerobic workout room, immediately, you will get the feel of a boxing atmosphere.Kathy starts out with a 10 minute warm-up, and then a 25-minute punching, jabbing, hooking, kicking, squating, stance, bobbing, weaving, and uppercuts all culminating to a high-adrenaline, workout. She will give a quick demo on the move, start out slow, then up the tempo. On the first try, you won't keep up much, but some moves will be easy to follow.After the 25 minute workout, a Buns and Thigh Kicking Drill is to strengthen the areas, you will use the aid of a chair to master the kicks, building strength, coordination, balance, etc. You will learn the moves.

It is really the type that you can do at your own pace. I have done Tae Bo before, and although it was a good workout, I found Billy Blanks EXTREMELY annoying. I hated the way he &quot;preached&quot; throughout the entire workout. This video is much more of what I am used to in an exercise video. It is well worth the money, especially since the DVD version that I have comes with a 45 minute version and a 60 minute version (I don't know if the VHS tape comes with both versions). This is great to switch up your workouts. This workout is very similar to TaeBo and I would recommed it highly to anyone who likes that type of workout. It is also good for people who like Kathy Smith and want to try a new workout.",5,So much better than Tae Bo!,1024272000,"06 17, 2002",0.2555
2,A2SAVTYOEBSNPF,738920525,Alyce In Wonderland The Looking Glass,"[3, 3]","Important Note for Beginners:If you have been working out regularly, and want to get into kickboxing aerobics, start here with Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke. If you are totally out of shape, start with something easier that will help you build some strength and endurance before you get into this DVD. I'd suggest starting withExtreme Makeover Fitness - Weight Loss Workout for Beginners.**This is a kickboxing AEROBICS video. It is meant to give you a workout that is based upon kickboxing. It's not intended to teach you how to do professional kickboxing. If you want a fun and challenging workout, kickboxing aerobics is a great choice.**I'm in great shape because of kickboxing aerobics. It's one of the few cardio exercises that really works the whole body at once. It's also empowering and fun.Few kickboxing aerobic DVDs teach you proper form. This one does. Keith Cooke is a professional with multiple titles, who teaches real kickboxing classes. He is given a side window on your screen throughout the workout. He teaches you proper footing, form and how to execute the drills safely. Kathy Smith does the main aerobics instruction. She offers a few alterations for beginners. She also helps Cooke keep the instruction going at times when he gets too quiet. As a team, these two give you all you need to get started and to practice drills that will help you keep proper form.WHO TO WATCH:BEGINNERS:Watch Kathy Smith. (Watch Keith Cooke when he is given the side windows. He is going to teach you how to execute the punches and kicks properly.) Kathy Smith will show you easier alterations to some of the tougher moves.INTERMEDIATES:Watch Keith Cooke or the female behind him, to the left. (She is introduced as Murmur, dressed in black and white.) Keith and Murmur have almost identical form. While the rest of the instructors tend to be a bit dancy, these two are no- nonsense boxers. They have a lot of energy and tons of power behind their kicks and punches. Keeping up with Keith's speed will make you sweat, no matter how in shape you are.I don't suggest following the third main instructor (Kelly Roberts). She tends to throw her body awkwardly off balance while kicking and punching. She's very showy and doesn't really follow Keith's suggestions for form.HOW TO ADD MORE CHALLENGE:Use weighted gloves and ankle weights. I useAltus Athletic AWK-PK Pink Walk Kit. While I hate pink, this set of gloves and ankle weights is mostly black with pink trim. However, the price ($19.99 for the set of gloves and ankles all together) is right and quality is good.Do Keith's Kickboxing Challenge. If you do the whole 55 minute kickboxing challenge workout, you'll have Keith's 5 minutes of challenging combos at the end. If you want to do just his 5 minute challenge, you'll find it under the main menu in choose your own workout.Double- time the kicks and punches when Kathy slows down to teach beginners the moves. By the time this video loses it's challenge for you, you'll know the moves well enough to get right into doing them at tempo.Once you have the moves down, you might want to try some more kickboxing DVDs. Here are some suggestions:Quickfix - Total Cardio Kick(Beginners. You can do this before Kathy Smith/Keith Cooke. Just know that you won't be taught proper form. Do it only for a fun workout.)Janis Saffell Kickbox Strike Zone(Easy to Intermediate levels.)Hard Core Kickbox Circuit(Easy to Harder Intermediate levels.)",5,"Perfect for teaching you the basics, and for helping you keep your form.

This DVD was so FUN and diverse, not at all boring or annoying. Kathy Smith is energic but not overly so, and she avoids talking and counting constantly which I find distracting and irritating. What I like is the customized option in which you can choose you work out length-- perfect for when you need to save time or when you want a more vigorous, lengthy work out. You may find yourself flubbing through the first two go-rounds, as I did, until you get the hang of it, but once you catch on, you REALLY feel the burn if you do it right.

The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout.

You can choose to play the DVD as a 45 minute beginner workout or as a 55 minute challenge. Note: The challenge is the 45 minute workout with some supplemental material tacked on the end. Kathy leads the initial 45 minute workout. The challenge material features Keith Cooke (a martial arts champion/expert who appears in numerous Hollywood movies, including Beverly Hills Ninja) demonstrating some very cool moves that you can follow along with. A nice cool-down stretch is included, as is a brief segment of light toning that contains moves that will help you put more power behind your kicks and stabilize your core muscles. Also present on the DVD is a short Tai-Chi inspired workout led by one of Kathy's back-up exercisers.The only drawback is, in my own opinion, that sometimes you stand in place punching for too long.

I had to do this three times before I learned all the routines. There are very few workouts that I can pick up on the first try.Kathy Smith and Keith Cooke take you through every move and I don't think they are too fast to keep up with. They stress to go at your own pace, anyway. (Taebo is just too fast for me)The first time I used this video, my back muscles were a little sore. I also lift light weights (Kathy Smith's weight training of course), so I am used to using my back and arm muscles.I like this video much more than her 'Aerobox Workout'.",5,A lot of FUN!,1045180800,"02 14, 2003",0.0948
8,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,738920525,Beth Cholette doctor_beth,"[65, 66]","This was my first kickboxing video, and I really enjoyed it. I was a bit hesitant to try it because I don't generally like aerobics videos--I find all that &quot;take it from the top&quot; really boring--but I'm glad I gave this workout a chance. At the start of the video, Ketih Cooke, a well-known kickboxer, provides main instructor Kathy Smith with simple explanations of each of the punches and kicks that will be used in the workout. This brief overview was helpful, but once you learn the moves, you can skip over this part.Following the instructive segment, Kathy Smith takes over. The workout begins with a warmup which lasts about 10 minutes. This provides the opportunity for you to get used to the movements, but don't be fooled by the &quot;warmup&quot; label--your heart rate will definitely be elevated during this section, and you will sweat! Next comes the 25-minute kickboxing workout. During this section, you will practice punches and kicks, starting slowly and then building up to a faster pace. Kathy was easy to follow, and she gradually worked up to basic punch-kick combinations which were simple to learn yet to fun to do. I did find myself getting pretty tired during this segment, but I was able to keep up by modifying the intensity slightly (eg, keeping my feet on the ground during the hops from side to side). At the end of this section, two short combinations are presented by Keith Cooke and another well-known instructor, Keli Roberts. I liked that these combinations were a bit different yet still easy to learn and that the repetitions of each were kept to a minimum. Throughout the workout, there were times when I felt like I might not be doing the moves exactly right, but I still enjoyed myself--all that punching and kicking felt GOOD!After the kickboxing workout ends, there is a 5-minute section focusing on the legs and glutes. In this segment, you practice the kicks more slowly, combining them with squats and holding on to a chair for balance. This was a nice way to reinforce what you learned during the workout, and I think that continued practice of this section will help to improve my kickboxing skills. Finally, the workout ends with a 5-minute cool down performed seated in a chair. These moves provided nice stretches for the thighs and glutes (although at one point, Kathy forgets to perform a squat stretch on the opposite side), and when they were over, I felt thoroughly stretched.I can't compare this video to Tae Bo, as I've never tried those workouts. However, I CAN say that this was a fun, high-energy video that left me feeling strong and powerful rather than exhausted. It was perfect for a kickboxing beginner like me, but it was also challenging enough to provide even non-beginners with a great workout. Kathy Smith has a nice, easygoing style and provides good overall instruction. There were a few times when I thought she failed to adequately cue a change in movement, but the workout was so easy to follow along that it wasn't hard to replicate the movements after the first repetition or two. I'm thrilled to have finally found a cardio video that is truly enjoyable, and I look forward to doing this video as part of my regular rotation.",5,So THIS is why people love kickboxing!,1081987200,"04 15, 2004",0.443

But I don't believe that it is as intense as TaiBo, from what I have read.The only thing that bothers me is that when I chose to do the challenge, the DVD plays the stretching segment first.

I wanted a video that would be most affective when it came to reshaping my body, so when I have read that this guy who's featured with Kathy in the video cover was a champion martial artist, I thought this might be a great video to buy. As I was watching the video, I noticed that it was Kathy who talked the most. At one point, when the guy was trying to say something, Kathy and he spoke at the same time. Now, I know that this was Kathy's video, but I was hoping that the guy would talk more than Kathy did, and take over more of the workout routines. I have nothing against Kathy, but she seemed like she looked little confushed at times (had blank look on her face), and she kind of moved slower then I liked. I was hoping that this video would be more like Billy Banks Taebo video, but less repetitve and hoped that it would contain more variety of moves. But, the moves that Kathy did in this video was more water downed version of Billy's video, and she moved lot slower and was more repeptive. Also, the guy look like he was better at this then Kathy. He just moved more naturally and more gracefully then Kathy did. He also seemed more knowledgeable about this kind of exercises then Kathy. He also made more proper body alignments when working out then Kathy. After watching the video, I was desapointed with this whole film.

20,A2TMQJD6VMSFHM,738920525,Kat Ramone katramone,"[6, 9]","I used to box and do karate when I was younger; however, it has been a while! I wanted to add variety to my aerobic workouts and decided to try this workout. I keep up a reasonably strenuous workout routine, and I am always seeking new routines to mix it up. This is really my fave aerobic workout, and I would do it everyday, but obviously, it would become too easy, boring, and ineffective, so I work it in twice-a-week, which keeps up the challenge and is quite effective for cardio, muscle-tone and endurance. I am really not into high impact aerobics, and when I do high impact, it is probably about twenty minute's worth. When I first did this video, I could complete only half the routine! As I continued, I have worked up to the Advanced workout, complete it, and feel like I really worked out well! If done correctly, one can really tighten and tone one's hips and thighs, and really learn to effectively kick should one so desire. Now, I do not know if this tape would be appropriate for those who are beginners or advanced...it may be too difficult for beginners, yet something which to work towards, and kickboxers may find this routine rather mundane. For the regular and advanced exerciser, however, I would certainly consider this routine challenging. The setting is in a boxing ring. To Kathy's left, is martial arts expert, Keith Cooke, and to her right, a somewhat well-known and well respected Australian fitness instructor/trainer, Keli Roberts (she appears in a Cher workout and has some videos of her own on the market). I was a bit surprised by her rather boyish redhead helmet hair style, which is probably why I did not recognize her, but that is not an issue--I was just surprised at how different she looked. There are others working out the routine behind them. I have the DVD version, so one may accomodate the workout to one's level and so on, but basically, the routine and moves consist of typical boxing moves with the arms (punches, upper cuts, hooks, jabs...), boxer's shuffle, and kick boxing moves with the arms and legs (elbow strikes, knee blocks, side kicks, round kicks...). Of course, this is put into a whole patterned routine, with Kathy (unfortunately) leading the group, but as said, it is still a very good workout. Keith Cooke is an excellent martial arts champion, and I have seen him in action. While there is a learn the moves segment, and picture-in-picture of Keith explaining how to properly maneuver and excecute some particular moves (as well as Keith doing the longer Tai Chi and Challenge Routine segments), the focus is really on Kathy. She executes the moves okay and has truly become more adept with her exercise variety since her Aerobox workout in which she is quite clumsy and sloppy, but Keith C. is excellent, and I would quite frankly rather have seen more of him doing the moves or at least leading the group! Kathy Smith introduces Keli as a person who has been kickboxing for about five years or so, but Keli is much more, and while Keli can obviously execute the moves, she really does not quite perform as Keith suggests they are to be done. If one notices, Keli often leans back when executing the kicks, and brings her arms out to and from the sides when performing the punches, which is basically how Keith suggests NOT to execute the moves! Personally, however, I would never tell Keli this to her face, and she does manage to have her own style. There also seems to be a bit of competition going on with Keli on Kathy's part. Perhaps it is because Keli appears to be one of the few women who is actually as tall or taller than Kathy, since Kathy always seems to tower over all of her fellow exerciser's. I have noticed in many of her routines, she will get close or next to her workout partners, but in one side kick routine, she goes right in front of Keli for most of the kicks to her right, which kind of conveys, Hey! I can kick as high as you! At the end of the workout, Keli and Keith each perform a brief combo routine to follow, and when Keli does hers, Kathy makes some type of silly move with her wrist before following along, and when it's Keith's turn, Kathy says, Let's do something a bit more complicated... Personally, I did not find Keith's routine THAT much more complicated! She also makes an apparent dig toward Keli during the Thighs and Buns Drills, which is done while supporting oneself using a chair (and to further Kathy's lala-ness, she manages to interrupt Keith after ASKING him how to execute the proper kicking form) when performing the kicks and she's behind Keli, Kathy states, You can put your weight on the chair...BUT DON'T PUT TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE CHAIR! Keli makes a kind of Face after the comment, but these are the little intricacies/annoyances one notices after doing the routine several times! So, while there is quite a bit of instruction, and yes, Keith Cooke is featured, it is Kathy's show. There is a Behind the Scenes segment in which Kathy does spend almost fifteen minutes interviewing Keith Cooke, which is very good, because as stated, he really is an excellent martial artist and interesting individual; however, if one watches Kathy's facial expressions as she's asking him questions and listening to him, she seems to be a bit spaced out, or in la la land. All that aside, overall this is a very good workout routine. If you are a beginner, do not expect to get through it the first time; if you are into kickboxing or strenuous aerobics this might be too simple; for the rest of us, intermediate in aerobics, who are up to the challenge of a more strenuous routine to add at least a few times a week, this workout is perfect. It is an excellent accompaniment to one's aerobic library that provides variety and effectiveness in one's routine.",4,"Effective, Fun Workout, Great to Add to One's Routine, Kathy Not So Great...",1113004800,"04 9, 2005",0.2525

Though I used to do Tae Bo religiously, my cardio routine fell by the wayside when we moved into a new house and [insert excuse after excuse here; reason #1 being that our new home has all-concrete floors and it took us a few months to outfit the gym with an appropriate mat]. Anyway, when I vowed to start back up again, I quickly decided against resuming Tae Bo. What with its quick switches between moves, sometimes confusing instructions, and uneven editing, I suspect that Tae Bo was a little too rough on my knees and ankles. Instead, I thought I might check out Kathy Smith's workout; I have some of her other videos, including a few light weight workouts, and enjoy them...well, as much as one can enjoy an exercise DVD.Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout is just what I needed - an excellent workout for beginners. If you're new to cardio and/or kickboxing, the 45-minute Basic workout is challenging but not impossibly so. Smith starts with a slow warm up, leads you into a moderately-paced workout (roughly 20 minutes in length), and then cools things down with a short buns and thighs kicking drills segment, followed by a cool down stretch and an abs and back strengthening workout. The run time is just over 45 minutes. I have a few minor quibbles - for example, switching or adding moves in the middle of a routine, which seems to me a no-no for beginners - but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, it's great.If you're expecting a more difficult routine from the 55-minute Challenge workout, forget it. Instead of putting together an entirely new routine for more experienced students - which is what I expected - Smith just adds two extra segments to the Basic workout and calls it a Challenge. Keith Cooke leads the added ten minutes of footage, which is divided into two segments: Kickboxing Stances (a review of the postures, which can hardly be called challenging) and Challenge (a few new combinations, again not super-difficult or especially intense). As much as I love the Basic workout, I'm super-disappointed in the Challenge; whereas I thought this might be a new routine I could move onto once I'd mastered the Basic workout, it's really just more of the same. Increased difficulty isn't just about endurance, but intensity too. 4/5 stars, with a point lost for the Challenge half of this DVD.Also, can the class please stop wearing baggy pants?

A variety of different punches and kicks are incorporated into cardio routines that get the heart rate up and make you feel invincible! I like how Kathy starts out by discussing safety with martial arts expert Keith Cooke. One important she and Keith stress throughout the workout is go at your own pace and not worry about kicking high or punching super hard.After the 10 minute warm-up, Kathy goes into a high-energy 25-minute workout. I like how she introduces the leg work (e.g. pivots) before she introduces the punches, focusing on good form. She also doesn't go straight into kicking (she does &quot;side folds&quot; to prepare you for the kicks). Throughout the tape you see clips of Keith doing the kicks and punches from different angles to help have good form. As a bonus, the tape includes thigh and buns kicking drills and back and abs stability exercises.When I first started doing the workout, I felt that she didn't cue on time and would announce a new adjustment after she started doing it. However, after doing the workout a couple of times, I knew what to expect so it wasn't as much of an issue. I find the workout highly addictive and the time flies by really quickly. The more I do the workouts, the more energy I have during the workouts and after.",4,Don't miss this workout!,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",0.3786

I guess the things I dislike about it are:- she messes up the counting sometimes- some of the little mini-routines are clumsy (for instance she'll have you stand there and punch with one hand really fast - what's the point?)- she's rude to Keith Cook (interrupts him, cuts him off, and clearly she favors the woman Kelly, the camera focuses mostly on her and Kelly)- if you watch Kelly, you'll injure yourself (I took lessons in martial arts for few years and Kelly does all these unnecessary gyrations with her hips that would cause her to fall over if anyone was actually there to receive her punches/kicks or punch/kick back, because she's so off center/balance)",3,Pretty good workout but not great,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",0.0752

I had heard of Kathy Smith, but had never seen any of her tapes, but after using this tape a few times I understand why she's so popular. Her approach is calm and knowledgeable, and both she and her co-instructor Keith Cooke fully explain the proper form and technique for each move. Beginners may find themselves tripping over themselves the first couple of times they do this, but after that it's fun and sweat all the way!

Though Kathy instructs you on careful and precise movements and good posture, you are really better off going to a class first where someone not only instructs you but checks that you are doing the moves correctly. However, after learning how to do the moves correctly, this video is excellent, though occasionally repetitive. Kathy and her friend can be a little bit annoying, but once you break a sweat, they are the last thing you're thinking about!",3,"Fun for experienced kickboxers, NOT FOR BEGINNERS",955584000,"04 13, 2000",0.3255

Although there is more than one workout on this DVD I always do the Kickboxing Challening one-and the name says it all; it is indeed challenging.The workout will make you sweat and involves lots of kicking, punching, hooks, uppercuts, etc. If you have no prior kickboxing experience, you should still be able to follow this workout. She is wonderful at cueing and starts each punch and kick series very slowly so you can learn the moves. You will feel this workout, and best of all, you should see results.Following the basic cardio section is a special buns section. You will need a chair (or something else to support yourself with) to do this and YOU WILL DEFINITELY feel it!! Basically you do some lunges and many kicks to improve form, strengthen and work those legs... this is a very effective section. Next, you learn some kickboxing stances that are HARD!!! This really works your legs (strengthens and stretches). It is much harder than it looks!!Then, the instructor will walk you through a series of challenging kickboxing routines. These were too hard for me to follow and I am usually too tired to do them. I like to just skip this section... it is not very long anyhow.Finally, the abs and back section. I don't find this that effective and it is too short.Anyhow, this workout is great and challenging! A+",5,Challenging,1088121600,"06 25, 2004",0.27

That review may have been thinking of Kathy Smith's boxing video - not her kickboxing video. I own the DVD. I find it to be an excellent workout. I bought it after doing Tae-Bo for six months. After doing it, my legs were sore - an indicator of a good workout! It has some fun combinations, with some guest instructors. It starts out with a 15-minute warmup, during which you will do moves to prepare you for the kicks. A long warmup is necessary before jumping into heavy cardio. Then, you start with punches, move onto kicks, and combinations. My only complaint is that the punching drills can become boring.

With that, I have the basic knowledge of cardio kickboxing moves and the way they are most commonly grouped together.HOWEVER, I found this DVD to be extremely difficult! I could not even finish it, and goodness knows I tried. Granted, I realize this is a personal conflict with the workout, so it's not necessarily affecting my rating.I didn't even care for the filming, it looks like it's done with a home video camera and does lots of cut scenes and blurs, etc. which try to make it look like a music video or something. Also, her microphone seems to be turned down too low and she's hard to hear. I didn't find her as an instructor at all realistic or motivating and she changes rapidly in between moves. They make indications about alterations you can make as a beginner but no one in the class is showing you these.The nice part about the DVD is the fact that it does let you customize your workout so you can take out certain portions and just do small bits. However, I was so discouraged by the annoying parts I didn't bother.If my opinion changes after more practice and when I'm in better shape, I'll happily update my review.

I wouldn't say it was easy the first time through, but I wasn't fumbling around trying to keep up neither. It took a few times to get the routine down. The kicks are pretty tough to do, but I believe that is my own fault because I'm not that flexible. I love the punches and little routines they also put together once they have taught you the moves.I can't say enough about the music! I love the techno feel it has and keeps you pumped up throughout the whole routine. There is also a lady in the workout who is does the routines so well. I catch myself watching her more than I do Kathy Smith because he is so intense!!!I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't mind a little or in my case, alot, of sweat. It can be pretty fast paced but its doable.

I like Tae Bo, and so I thought I would check this one out for a change of pace. (I like Billy Blanks a lot, but some days I just need to spend time with other people. Hee hee.) I enjoyed the video a lot, so I bought the DVD.I think the DVD is a lot better than the video. You can correct me if I am wrong, but the DVD has a lot of extra goodies on it that I do not recall seeing on the video. Some of the extra goodies include a 15-minute Tai Chi workout with Kelly (the red-haired woman) and a few basic martial arts lessons with Keith Cooke (also approximately 15 minutes). I do not find it as challenging as the Tae Bo Get Ripped workouts, but it still does its job extremely well and I enjoy it very much.Just keep in mind that this workout is in no way any kind of lesson in self-defense.

One of the things I really like about this video is the length of each routine. Kathy gives you enough time to learn the moves, then practice the move, which lessens the risk of injuring yourself. Beginners might find this video hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a lot of fun! And it's great cardio exercise! This video is definitely heads above the Tae-Bo series which goes at a very fast pace and doesn't allow you time to learn what you are doing. Kathy Smith always does a great job researching whatever exercise genre she is working in and her choreography is very good.
