Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator, the story suffers from &quot;politically correct&quot; environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas. None of it was necessary and detracts the story.Furthermore, there is no artistic continuity with the original &quot;Frosty&quot;. None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything, either.I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD. The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is &quot;Frosty's Winter Wonderland&quot;. Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one.",2,"Frosty goes PC, with poor results",975369600,"11 28, 2000",0.1671

The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting! Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.,1,Worst Christmas special ever!,976233600,"12 8, 2000",-0.2614
3,A6GMEO3VRY51S,307142477,microjoe,"[3, 4]","As long as you know BEFORE you buy it that Frosty Returns is not the sequel to Frosty the Snowman, you can see it without complaint. It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.IF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled Frosty's Winter Wonderland. That special starts right where the first one left off. The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel. The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back. While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.AND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July.",4,Not the real Frosty sequel- see Frosty's Winter Wonderland for real sequel,1133827200,"12 6, 2005",0.306
4,A10QA1BKQLVUR,307142477,Mrs Pink,"[3, 5]","This is with out a doubt is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen! My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason. The movie is filled with overdone, unrealistic, trite political issues of the 90's. It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot. Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues. There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd. The original Frosty is so wonderfully simple, buy that one instead.",1,Frosty returns,975888000,"12 4, 2000",0.0297
5,A3OWKT7JZV8NT9,307142477,Philip D. Parshall,"[2, 3]","Narration is OK but the story is weak and the songs are brilliantly unremarkable. I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic, rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops!
