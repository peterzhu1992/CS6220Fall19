You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John might say to Emma, You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please. John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good. Thank Mother because they are much better than the Sean Connery film.",5,Steel Leather and an Umbrella,972000000,"10 20, 2000",0.2702
1,A20JYIHL1W1U54,767018702,hille2000 hille2000,"[2, 3]","1966 was a great year. `The Avengers was a popular 1960's British fantasy-adventure series that focused on the exploits of a male-female duo in the service of the British government. The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed's first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed's new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest. These DVD copies are gorgeous and 1966 volume 3 is one of the best.",5,The Danger Makers and other great Episodes,984441600,"03 13, 2001",0.4189

Steed and Mrs. Peel are truly tested when they investigate powerful military men who are addicted to life threatening danger, after the war is over, and some very out there devil worshipers. And mystery and identity switches as well as spies are a laugh and a gasp a minute. Did the butler do it? Delightful!",5,The Whole Enchalada,1312848000,"08 9, 2011",0.0143

Oh my sweet Lord in heaven, it's Mistress Emma Peel, all dolled up as Kitten With A Whip and all of my kinkiest fantasies come true in glorious black and white... MEOW! And what makes the best of the three best episodes from the season of '66 even better is the brilliant-as-always performance of Peter Wyngarde, who was equally brilliant in the best episode of '67, EPIC! Not to mention his roles as The New Number Two in Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner, and all of his perfectly pernicious portrayals of various venomous villains in I Spy, The Saint, The Baron, and many more of the best shows of the Sixties! However, he is best known for his star-making turn in both Department S and his own spin-off series portraying the Uber-Groovy, Ultra-Gear swinging Dick named Jason King, (who was no doubt the main inspiration for Mike Myers riotous rip-off character, Austin Powers!) Unfortunately, big Peter was caught with little Peter out of his closet having a snog in the bog with a truck driver, (or pulling a George Michael), and his career was thoroughly and maliciously ruined just as it was hitting third gear, and poor Peter was quite literally driven into abject poverty due to the rigid, narrow-minded, and intolerent mentality of the times. But fear not friends, for you can and should catch one of the great Peter Wyngarde's all-time best roles in A Touch Of Brimstone, which was one of the all-time best in these 3 ep. sets during the all-time best season of the all-time FAB-best show of all time!",5,FAB-best!,1200873600,"01 21, 2008",0.5236
