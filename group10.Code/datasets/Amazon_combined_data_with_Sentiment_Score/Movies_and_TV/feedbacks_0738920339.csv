Great to see the cast of the Broadway play Stomp interact with the S.S. kids-they were all fantastic.,5,Awesome!,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",0.511
1,A244D7MGOADGS5,738920339,Bookworm in WI,"[5, 5]","As a musical family, my husband and I enjoy this video as much as my daughter does! Members of Stomp and other Sesame Street clips show us that music is all around us--we can make music with anything! All the rhythmic clapping, tapping, banging on pots (always a fun toddler activity), and singing really keep my 17 month old daughter enthralled. We're thrilled, because my husband and I really hope she develops the love of music we have. Even if you're not pushing music at home, it's very entertaining for the young ones, and a good video to add to your Sesame Street library!",5,What a fun video!,973209600,"11 3, 2000",0.5369

This is my kiddos favorite DVD out of all the Sesame Street DVDs.,5,This is all about percussion.,1356048000,"12 21, 2012",0.1147

More importantly, it is not overly annoying to adults.How I rated this DVD:* Educational value. Since buying this DVD my daughter has become very interested in making her own music. I have found her stomping, making drums from rubbermade containers, and trying to blow in bottles. She is only 20 months old and I think this is very impressive since we have only had the tape a few weeks.* Entertaining to child. Keeps her entertained through the whole video.* Entertaining to adults. I can even watch the tape with her and not become mindlessly numb.* The DVD starts right at the menu. No annoying commercials to sit through.* Cost. The video did not break the budget. It was reasonably priced.",5,Stomp is a great addition,1061251200,"08 19, 2003",0.3243

In this video, Telly learns that music can be made from many different things, as the members of Stomp! make music all along Sesame Street with different every day objects. My favorite part has to be the can can part with Oscar the Grouch. The two guys from Stomp! in this part are hilarious with their facial expressions and then dialogue (Cans? We've got cans! and Yeah, we'll go get them!). Trust me, you've got to see that part. It's adorable.Easily one of my daughter's favorite videos too, she will sit through this one time and time again. It is a great video for fans of Sesame Street (of all ages!).",5,One of the best Sesame Street videos!,1012521600,"02 1, 2002",0.2331

8,ALWKZ81HDSCC1,738920339,Stefanie N,"[2, 2]","Cast members from Stomp ! and characters from Sesame Street demonstrate that music, and particularly percussion, can be made and found everywhere. Combining the Sesame Street habitat with animation and live-action video tape keeps the pace moving. The variety of musical experiences is remarkable. We see hand-clapping games and drumming by children, chanting,pot-and-pan banging, as well as Stomp cast-members' inventive use of everyday objects that include balls, paper bags and huge oil drums. There's a wonderful sequence that choreographs cracking eggs and slamming doors. It's a terrific tape and our 2-year old has gotten a lot from it.One word of advice for those with younger kids. You may need to use your fast-forward button at times as some sections are perhaps too talky but that depends on your kid of course.",5,Inventive and fun,985651200,"03 27, 2001",0.2666
9,A124SYJU4QTMU8,738920339,W. Dyba,"[5, 5]","This is a really fun DVD. My daughter enjoys it a lot.The only problem is that Amazon lists these Sesame Street DVDs as from 1969. I purchased a few of them to discover that only portions, such as the pinball count video, are from the original Sesame Street. The majority of the scenes are not from my generation at all!Otherwise, it's a swell DVD!",4,Another Amazon Sesame Street DVD listed incorrectly as 1969.,1085270400,"05 23, 2004",0.2982
