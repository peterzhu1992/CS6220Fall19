0,A35QF1GDLAFYCL,764005022,A. Calabrese othernj,"[62, 63]","The Last Valley, written and directed by the historical novel writer James Clavell. It is co-written by J. B. Pick, whose only other claim to fame is being the screenwriter of the Dean Martin, Matt Helm movie, The Wrecking Crew. That aside this is a well made film with a great story. Filmed on location in the Tyrol area of Italy, these natural and scenic backdrops add historical credibility to this film, as well as providing breathtaking views.The story is about a Captain, played brilliantly by Michael Caine, in charge of a group of multi-national mercineries during the 17th Century Thirty Years War. It is also about a wanderer, seeker, and a man escaping from the ravages of war, Vogel, played by Omar Sharif. There is also a large international supporting cast, who all do their part, most notable being Nigel Davenport as the Village elder, Per Oscarsson as the village priest, and Arthur O'Connell, most known for his part on the 70's TV show, Chico and the Man.What started out as Religious Wars, mainly in what is present day Germany, and Alpine Valleys quickly turned into political jocking by petty German Princes, the Holy Roman Emporer, the Kings of France, Sweden, and Denmark. Added to all this war destruction were outbreaks of the plague. The film does a wonderful job with reconstructing this historical backdrop, even with minor details, like when the village priest asks one of the soldiers Are you a Lutheran Protestant, a Calvin Protestant, or God forbid a heretical Anabaptist or Satan worshiper. While the Catholics and Protestants, throughout the 17th century, had a love-hate relationship, to put it mildly, the both agreed on their disdain for all things Anabaptist (present day Mennonites, Amish and Hutterites.)Michael Caine, as the Captain, plays a freebooting leader of a religiously mixed group of mercenaries, who wreak havoc and destruction on any city, town, or village in their way. They have two rules, the Captain calls the shots, and they are not allowed to discuss religion. Omar Sharif plays Vogel, an educated wanderer, all too familiar with the ravages of this hypocritical war. He has been running from it for 20 years. Things are so bad, that even gold and silver, have lost their appeal. All people want is peace and the ability to farm their small part of the world. The film opens with an emaciated Vogel wandering into a small village trying to purchase food and shelter, not seconds later, rumbling down the moutains into the valley are the Captains soldiers, who burn, pillage, and rape with abandon, and some with a self-imposed blessing by God in their warrior pursuits. So, once again Vogel is forced to run, over mountains and valleys until he comes by a deserted, idyllic, little village in a naturally protected valley. But, his peace doesn't last long before the Captain arrives in the same place. They find the villagers hiding in the mountains. Vogel convinces the captain that this, little piece of paradise, would make a great place to winter over, and he being educated could act as the go-between soldier and peasants. I don't want to give more away, but against the backdrop of war, fanatical religion, lust, and a search for peace this story continues to unfold.This is a great movie, running, 2 hours and 5 minutes. Michael Caine is brilliant as the pragmatic, unbelieving warrior. Omar Sharif, as a kind of naive 17th century, Parsifal, plays off of Caine's cynicism and hatred of all things religious and political. There is great inter-personal relationships in this film also.This movie should be shown in all world history classes as it provides a great tool for what life was like during the Thirty Years War. 5 Stars Plus for this wonderful movie.",5,A Great Period Film Well Made,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",0.0838

Don't be put off however, this is a very good and polished piece of filmaking, which deals (quite graphically for the year of production) with the savage and often futile 30 years War that raged across 17th Century Europe. This is not a typical story though, and interestingly deals with an uncomfortable but workable peace pact between, Michael Caine as the warring Captain (and mercenary army) and Omar Sharif as a local peasant. As this wafer thin respite gradually succumbs to the vagaries of the marauding soldiers, the story kicks up a notch with some good action sequences and thought provoking scenarios. Caine is superb throughout, and is something of an island of drama amidst what would otherwise be a plodding script, despite the pedigree of writer James Clavell (of Shogun fame).

They are convinced to winter there instead of pillaging it.Although I despise Michael Caine, I have to admit that this early role of his was carried out to perfection. Omar Shariff, although an excellent actor, also gives a good performance, but because of his dark complexion it is hard to picture him as a native German of the time.It is a very depressing, anti-war, movie.

Marold,"[6, 10]","`The Last Valley', written, produced, and directed by novelist, James Clavell was, in my mind, a viable candidate for being an underappreciated gem of a movie. Before I bought the DVD, I had seen the movie but once on commercial TV in the 1970's and the memory of the movie has stayed with me ever since. The most distinctive aspect of the story is that it deals with an historical period that is almost totally unknown to most Americans who are neither professional historians nor history buffs. Even many events in the history of ancient Greece and Rome are probably better known to many than the story of the 30 years war which by some accounts could be counted as a `world war', running from 1618 through 1648 and creating, in the process, some of the most memorable figures of modern European history such as the French king Louis XIV (the Sun king), Cardinal Richilieu, Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus, and general Wallenstein, the subject of a Schiller dramatic trilogy in the 19th century. As told by a brief introductory blurb at the beginning of the movie, this war began as a religious war between Protestant and Catholic, but devolved into a purely political struggle between France, Sweden, the Holy Roman Empire, and the larger German states such as Bavaria. This was so destructive that some history books I have read have said that Germany did not recover from the effects until its unification by Bismarck in the 19th century.In it's broadest terms, the outline of the plot is very similar to other movies such as `The Magnificent Seven / The Seven Samurai' and `The Thirteenth Warrior' where a band of trained soldiers comes to the aid of a village. Since these three movies are so good, one tends to set high expectations for `The Last Valley' with a similar plot. The fact that there are some differences in setting are irrelevant to the quality of the movie. In `The Last Valley', the soldiers are not invited or contracted to come into the village. This company of about thirty mercenaries, lead by captain Michael Caine stumble upon this isolated, hidden village in a remote valley somewhere near the headwaters of the Rhine in southern Germany where the winter snows blocks the passes into the village for half the year.The company is foraging for food as an advance or detachment from a larger army that may or may not be nearby. Expectations on what the mercenaries will do to the village are set by the PG rated violence seen behind as the movie opens as other villagers are robbed, raped, and killed out of hand, if they have not already fallen victim to the plague. By coincidence, the village is also found at the same time by a wandering scholar, Vogel, played by Omar Sharif, who ends up being the mediator between the captain and the town leader, Gruber. In the course of just a few minutes, Vogel convinces the captain to `move in' on the valley rather than carrying off all its goods. The speed with which the captain agrees to this is a sign of how week was the allegiance of soldiers to the causes for which they fought. In this war, it was much more profitable, and probably even a bit safer to be a soldier than to be a farmer. The captain and his loyal lieutenants summarily kill the very few members of this company who object. I was just slightly annoyed at this as one of those killed off after about 3 minutes on the screen is a mercenary played by Brian Blessed who was featured as Caesar Augustus in the PBS series `I, Claudius'.While the southern German village was naturally Catholic, the band of mercenaries was a gemish of Catholics and Protestants and only a few of the Protestant soldiers had strong feelings about the existence of the Catholic church and a minority of soldiers showed Catholic leanings when the captain moves a shrine from the path leading to the village.All of this setup is the platform upon which Clavell presents his primary idea that this war has killed God, primarily at the especially bloody (historically accurate) battle of Magdeburg that occurred ten years before the time of the movie. The captain states that Magdeburg was razed in retaliation to the siege of some other city which was attacked to pay for the distruction of some other town which was destroyed to avenge the sack of some village and on and on and on, and God has done nothing to stop it. This speech is the linchpin of the whole movie, as it resonates all the way back to Greek tragedy where a vendetta between two families is only stopped by judges who claim the authority of the gods, so their decision cannot be avenged by further violence. All this is boiled down to the simple quote from the Bible of `Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord'. But at Magdeburg, the Lord seems to have disappeared from its role in human life.All this is great stuff and everything connected to this worldview in the movie makes some sense. The only problem is that moviemaker Clavell does not give us much on which to develop an interest in whether these characters live or die. A simple comparison between our feelings for these villagers and the Mexican peasants in `The Magnificent Seven' shows us that the characters in `The Last Valley' have about as little soul as the missing God whose lack of attention has created these scenes of distruction straight out of a painting by Breughel. The only interest is in the chess game of force and allegiances played out between the captain, Vogel, Gruber, and the captain's troops.The DVD has no extras to speak of. Unlike `The 13th Warrior', I think this movie deserves the obscurity into which it has fallen.",4,"Lost & great the first time around, but pales after the 2nd",1112745600,"04 6, 2005",-0.1473

8,A3N94LNED0IF0R,764005022,Charles S. Tashiro,"[5, 18]","&quot;The Last Valley&quot; is a curious film that always seems to be missing something. The &quot;something&quot; isn't difficult to locate: Vietnam. Placed against the context of when it was released, the story's fixation on the brutalities of a senseless civil war make some sense as a metaphor for contemporary events. Some thirty years later, however, every action and character seems to be waiting to be filled in by a topical reference long since forgotten.Because everyone seems to have been paying attention to something else, the film never really focuses on moving us through its own internal logic. This lack of attention to its own dynamics results in some real peculiarities. For example, in a dramatization of a war that took place largely in Germany, we have an Arab, several Englishmen, an American, a Swede and a Brazilian in the cast, but as far as I can tell, not one German. Clavell obviously wants to be taken seriously, but for all the promises of having Something Important to say about Big Themes, there's very little delivery. The film doesn't even approach the political and historical sophistication of such big budget spectaculars as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia,&quot; much less provide any insight into the complexities of the *very* complex Thirty Years War.Of course, one could argue that the film isn't really about the Thirty Years War, but rather an allegory about all war. Certainly the &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;-like situation adds a level of irreality to the proceedings. For an allegory to work, though, it has to be pitched at a level of abstraction that makes us aware we should not take events literally. (Capra's film of &quot;Lost Horizon,&quot; though a bit of a chore in its own right, at least succeeds at that task.) Unfortunately, &quot;The Last Valley&quot; contains too much gore, venality, parochialism, intolerance, envy, lust and petty-mindedness to allow such a fairy-tale situation to bloom. The film's physical Realism and attempts at historical veracity work against its allegorical pretensions.A real filmmaker, someone who can make images compel regardless of the tinniness of the ideas they contain, might have been able to shape these events into something at least passably entertaining. As a director, Clavell is too honest and gentlemanly for his own good. He slogs along earnestly and methodically, rarely insulting our intelligence, but even more rarely engaging it. In short, in addition to lacking the context of Vietnam to give the story more punch, &quot;The Last Valley&quot; hasn't the *style* to succeed on its own right. It isn't so much a bad film as a set of actions, actors, ideas and themes waiting to be brought together.",2,Waiting for a director,980640000,"01 28, 2001",-0.0009

Clavell's choice of Europe in the midst of one of the worst calamities to befall Western Civilization was done because this time and place, along with the Thirty Years War, was the crucible from which the modern world emerged...the modern territorial state, sovereignty, secularism, humanism, etc. You do not have to look very hard to find references to these issues in the film. But beyond that, there are universal isssues here. True, there is a reaction to the war in Vietnam, America's worst foreign policy calamity, as there are numerous reactions to other anxieties of that time, relgion, superstition, inhumanity and humanity, and, of course, war. A national news magazine, at the time, ran the headline &quot; Is God Dead?&quot; Richard M. Nixon was forming an &quot;enemies list.&quot; Revelations of American atrocities in Southeast Asia were coming out. Of course this was a troubled time. Michael Caine and Omar Sharif portray composite chararacters...they are both cast in the role of &quot;everyman.&quot; But each represents different but no less vital parts of humanity...the realist and the idealist...hope and the abandonment of hope. You must see the film, and then ponder which holds out for mankind. The film itself is well acted, especially by Caine (note the basis for his character in &quot;The Eagle Has Landed) and Sharif, and directed. Clavell's script is profound at times. It is beautifully, and dramtically, photographed. And it is driven by a musical score that is one of John Barry's best achievements. The transfer to DVD is not as good as one might have hoped for. It is in the bargain category, afterall. It remains visually stunning, and the sound has been preserved quite well, for the most part. This was Clavell's project from top to bottom...director, producer, writer...and he deserves credit for what is good in this film, and of course, takes blame for aspects that have not weathered as well.

The 2.35:1 format of its original theatrical exhibition is respected, which wasn't done in the VHS release (cropped to a pan and scan 4:3 format), but it is NOT ENHANCED for 16:9 TVs which is horrible. You get black bars on all 4 sides of your TV and if you zoom, get a worse image quality, something that the people that did the transfer didn't even bother to work on. Besides, one gets English subtitles in a black box which cannot be removed and obstruct the image all the time. And you can't get that information until you've been ripped off and you hold helplessly the DVD box and watch in awe the tiny image on your TV. The back side of the movie should also be published along with the cover in Amazon with good enough quality so one can read all the specifications.So, it is about time for this movie to be released in a Blu-ray format after a good remaster of the colors and the movie itself, adding some bonus material like interviews or The making of..., or whatever is there available.P.S.

22,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,764005022,Octavius,"[9, 11]","James Clavell (author of Shogun) wrote this story specifically for this movie and handled all of the production and direction with mixed results. The Thirty Years War presents a unique setting for a movie and showing how religious fanaticism with political ruthlessness brings out the worst in people. The Thirty Years War is by far the bleakest conflict to touch Europe prior to the Napoleanic wars of the 19th Century. The war brought utter misery and devastation across a vast stretch of Europe during the early 17th Century; mostly fought by mercenaries who had about as much religious ethos as their petty patron kings.The script is rich in characters and the dynamics of their interaction keeps the tension and drama moving smoothly for the most part except the end could be said to be somewhat abrupt. The story follows the story of Vogel (Sharif), a scholar who flees the carnage and pestilence of the war and comes upon a secluded and pristine valley populated by Catholics. At the same time, a band of mercenaries led by their captain (Caine) fighting for the Protestants arrive to wrek havoc. With blood about to spill and his life at risk, Vogel acts as an intermediary and is soon found useful by the Machiavellic captain who sees the valley as a valuable base of operation. The pristine beauty and prosperity of the valley acts as a sharp contrast to the bleak outside world devastated by war. The mercenaries decide to an uneasy truce with the villagers to hold out for the oncoming winter. Tempers boil and rivalries begin to flare in all sectors. Great plot development but the casting of Sharif as a German scholar is not entirely convincing. He doesn't really look the part or act the part. Caine plays his role quite well as the Captain and even keeps up a good German accent. All in all though, almost all of the main actors did a good job.The worse aspects of the film are in its direction and editing as well as the costume designs/special effects. Although some takes of the valley can be quite breath taking, Clavell's selection of other scenes demonstrates his amateurish talent as a film director. What could be panoramic scene shots to add to the force of the script and the actors are inexplicably reduced to awkward takes having neither background or focus on the actors. The absolute worse aspects of this film are in make up and costumes that are either blatantly and badly fake or completely inapposite to the period of the film. Plague bodies are covered in plastic sores with ruby nail polish for blood; this of course rendered worse by Clavell's horrible direction where he actually guides the camera and action right against stage lights. The mercenaries in the film look more like they came right from the set for the Road Warrior with ridiculous leather garnments and punk haircuts carrying flails and axes instead of musket and rapier. The battle scenes are equally horrible and were clearly indoor particle board sets that seem just about to fall on the actors. The special effects and props seemed too poor even for a 1971 production and seemed more like something for the stage or television perhaps. Worth watching at least once but I personally regret having purchased it: it makes a better rental. Too bad the film wasn't directed by a competent director such as Kubrick, Lean, or even Pekinpah instead of Clavell: it would have been a better movie.",3,Clavell!

E.g., Hansen is a very unlikely name for a Catholic, comes out of Scandinavia (Lutheran). There are also major irritations. The geography is bad. The movie was shot in Trins, just north of the Brenner Pass, which is fine, but Rheinfelden (just east of Basel and south of Freiburg) is supposed to be near the Alps in the movie. Rheinfelden is a very long way north of the Alps. Our heroes ride out of the valley to join a Sachsen army south of the Rhein planning to cross north to attack Rheinfelden. But Rheinelden is on the south side of the Rhein, no bridge is needed.Clavell is certainly not Hemmingway. the latter wrote so geographically accurately that he fooled Italian historians into thinking he'd actually been in the Slovenian Alps in WWI. Bad geography means a bad movie, nothing is believable. Rheinfelden on the Swiss side is an old fortified city, the region is Catholic. At least that much is correct.My wife calls the movie 'blutr&uuml;nstiges Edelweiss' (bloody Edelweiss), total kitsch. I thought some of the message about war was at least accurate.

It was a period piece that was somewhat slow moving, but with excellent acting and overall production values. As others have stated Michael Caine puts in one of his absolute best performances ever.

Some of the camera work is a bit raw, but overall the film shines as a film.Even so the DVD transfer is a low bit rate, and the presentation suffers for it. A new transfer with the original edit on blu-ray would be welcome. If I had a critique of the film itself, it's that there aren't enough action sequences.

It puts its characters through all the tribulations of Europe in the Thirty Years' War; it isn't light entertainment. But as cinematic history it's important: James Clavell in a rare role as director; Michael Caine and Omar Sharif in brilliant performances; early roles by young actors like Brian Blessed.And it may seem overwrought. The director took at least some visual motifs from Breughel and other dark artists of the period. Others have told me this last valley seemed almost a surreal vision of Alpine heaven, an unrealistic Sound of Music setting. Perhaps that was the point, that this village would represent a vision, a haven from the hellpit that Europe had become by 1640. It's almost a fantasy, a fever dream. In truth there may have been no such haven in that war; probably every village, town and city in Germany or Bohemia were sacked at least once, and the population of Germany fell by anywhere from a fifth to a third.Perhaps Omar Sharif's character is a metaphor, as is the Captain -- as much as the carnival fool and the knight in Seventh Seal, although the Sharif and Caine characters are far more haunted. (Indeed, the icy Captain is still guilt-ridden merely for having been present at the sack of Magdeburg, and the burning of the city's people). Hoffman, the superstitious peasant (played, competently enough, by Arthur O'Connell) and Gruber as the cagey, cunning village chief, are also parable characters of all the people of this village and those times. As a refraction of those terrible years, the film works.The cinematography, the staging, the score, the script are all first-rate. The transfer, given the age of the film, is good.

27,A2RH7ARWQSUVQV,764005022,Ron Braithwaite Hummingbird God,"[3, 3]","'The Last Valley' is an intelligent film dealing with a seldom discussed period...the Thirty Years War...in which Germany became the battleground for virtually every disputed issue in Europe. The proximate cause was the Protestant Reformation with the strenuous and often lethal Catholic reaction. As the war...or wars...went on for years, the religious issues oftentimes became blurred by dynastic and other power issues. French, English, Spanish, Dutch and Swedish armies ravaged Germany. Half the population died of warfare and plague. Horror produced tsunammis of superstition and tens of thousands were hanged, burned, mutilated as witches.'The Last Valley' is just that...the last valley in Germany not yet utterly devastated by war. All that is about to change when 'The Captain's' [Michael Caine's] gang of mercenary marauders chances on the hapless populace. The war has gone on so long that Caine is not only known as only 'The Captain' but he may have actually forgotten his original name. Like all of his men, he is brutal, but unlike the rest of them, he is intelligent. The Burgomeister [Omar Shariff] of the town/valley knows that his people are doomed so he makes a Faustian bargain with the 'Captain'. Don't devastate the Valley. Over-Winter, here, and protect it. We, the people of this valley will provide for your men...food, women, shelter.One of 'The Captain's' men protests that such a deal is against military/religious/political precedent. 'The Captain' answers him by thrusting his picklehaubed, pointed helmet into his guts. 'The Captain' has made his decision. This film, which is a 'small' film and never got nearly the credit it deserved, is a genuine classic. Perhaps the most memorable line of the movie is uttered by the Captain when asked about his belief in witchcraft. His reply is one of harrowing belief and profound cynicism.

That was in the 17th-century Counter-Reformation, when Protestants and Catholics were killing each other in the name of God.

Caine is terrific, as usual, in a restrained but very powerful and menacing role. Omar Sharif plays a character trying to do what's right in a world that has forgotten the meaning of the word.

30,A220FJEQNGMSRN,764005022,Trevor Willsmer,"[10, 10]","Filmed under the incredibly unwieldy and oh-so-Sixties title Somewhere in the Mountains there is a Last Valley and hindered by financing problems, The Last Valley marked the end of screenwriter James Clavell's directorial career and the beginning of the end of the thinking man's epic genre. Which is a great pity, because this almost completely forgotten Shangri-La tale set during the Thirty Years War, the last of the great European religious wars, deserves to be much better known despite the potentially disastrous miscasting of the two leads. Omar Sharif is no more anyone's ideal casting as a 17th Century German schoolteacher trying to talk his way out of a premature death than Michael Caine is anyone's idea of a German mercenary captain, yet despite a few moments unease at Caine's aksent (a dry run for the one he used in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), within moments you realise that against all odds both actors are delivering surprisingly sincere and well-judged performances.From the main title animation that sees a cross split into two sword-wielding rival soldiers, it's not always a pretty picture, making few bones about the dirt, ugliness and squalor of the times, with Sharif's schoolteacher wandering from village massacre to plague pits before literally stumbling upon an unspoilt and unlooted valley. Unfortunately he stumbles across it at the same time as Caine's [...]-ugly ragtag band of mercenaries, cutthroats, murderers, rapists, Papists, Protestants and atheists pillaging the countryside for supplies. Convincing them to spend the Winter there in comfort rather than see the valley's food gone in days if they share it among their army, he finds himself cast as an uneasy go-between trying to improvise and keep the fragile peace between the mercenaries and the villagers. But for all its beauty, the valley is no idyllic haven but just as riven with suspicion, prejudice and duplicity as the outside world as the two sides engage in a constant subtle power struggle: ultimately it is not the valley that is destroyed by the soldiers but the soldiers who are destroyed by the valley as they are reminded of the people they almost were. Even Sharif's intermediary has more to fear from the villagers than the soldiers.A huge box-office flop in 1970 (in the States it quickly ended up as a second feature), it's far from a conventional epic. There are only a couple of action scenes, and only one of them qualifies as spectacular, while its characters are not major figures but human driftwood caught up in the wake of greater events and gradually rejecting the accepted religious and moral beliefs of their time. Instead of a triumphant tone, it's a melancholy picture about people trying to survive in the worst of all possible worlds, where moments of beauty are merely reminders of how much has been lost in the past rather than what could be in the future. John Barry's superb score, possibly his best ever, reflects this beautifully, alternating the savagery he displayed in his earlier The Lion in Winter with an incredibly beautiful theme for the valley. It's not a film for all tastes, but there's a melancholy magic there willing to look for it.It's a shame that none of the extras-free DVD versions available do justice to the 65mm photography (though the sadly extras-free Region 1 MGM and Anchor Bay releases are at least widescreen, unlike the clumsily cropped UK release), but it's still a film that deserves to be sought out in its original widescreen ratio.",5,A forgotten epic well worth remembering,1188777600,"09 3, 2007",-0.1936

34,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,764005022,Wuchak,"[22, 22]","I was at the store and spied this unknown 1971 flick amongst the DVDs; it looked like my kind of movie, especially with Michael Caine and Omar Sharif, so I naturally wondered why I had never heard of it. I made a mental note to check out some reviews on the internet. The across-the-board high ratings piqued my interest, so I decided to pick it up the next time I saw it.The first thing that made a favorable impression was the outstanding opening credits sequence. Many reviewers mention John Barry's magnificent score as a highlight and they're right. This credits sequence innovatingly depicts the theme of the Thirty Years War -- members of essentially the same religion at each other's throats.THE STORY: During the horrible Thirty Years War in Europe (1618-1648) a band of mercenaries led by the merciless Michael Caine (The Captain) and a drifter attempting to flee the horrors of the war discover a hidden vale -- the last valley untouched by the war. The drifter talks The Captain into wintering in the peaceful valley rather than pillaging it and raping/killing the villagers. (This setup itself is a hint that this is no ordinary war flick).WHAT WORKS: Parts of the film have a dreamy, surreal atmosphere, particularly the beginning and ending; this is reminiscent of the incomparable Apocalypse Now. Michael Caine is outstanding as The Captain, a character so hardened by the horrors of war that he no longer even has a name, he's just The Captain. Caine would perform a similar role in the underrated The Eagle Has Landed in 1977, a stunning performance. The Captain's answer to everything was to simply kill, but now, in the valley, he has found peace and the warmth of love. Omar Sharif also perfectly depicts the disillusioned drifter, Vogel, his reaction to the horrors of war has always been to run, but in the valley he also finds peace and love, and even -- maybe -- a family? The depth and ultra-seriousness of the story, including the dialogue of the characters touching on issues of war, loss, God, religion, ignorance, superstitions, love, hope, loyalty, duty, redemption, etc. truly separate this pic from an ordinary war-adventure yarn.It's also very interesting to observe how people lived in a regular hamlet 400 years ago in backwoods Europe. It was not unusual for people back then in such circumstances to live their entire lives within 10 miles or so from where they were born. Such people would likely be under-educated, superstitious, innocent, ignorant and narrow-minded all at the same time, and the film realistically portrays this.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: There are parts of the film that aren't pulled off very well. Some of the dramatic stagings and dialogue come off awkward here and there. These aspects perhaps needed more fine-tuning and this explains why critics originally panned the movie and why it fell into obscurity for thirty years (a fitting curse for being the only movie to ever address the Thirty Years War, eh?).Some have criticized the film for being anti-church or even anti-God. Actually the film's about the pursuit of God, truth, love and happiness in the face of the ultimate horror -- war. And not just any war, a war that lasted three decades wherein innocent civilians -- men, women, children & family members -- were needlessly slaughtered. The repugnance and terror of war caused The Captain to become a ruthless atheist, as he declares in one potent scene, and tore the heart out of Vogel, as revealed in another. But the last valley untouched by the neverending conflict has given them both hope again.***SPOILER ALERT***Originally The Captain was going to slay Vogel as soon as he met him, but after wintering in the valley he sets Vogel up as the leader while he leaves to attend to the business of war. He obviously had a change of heart concerning Vogel. In any event, he returns to the vale, wounded, his only sanctuary from the evils of battle and plague. His dying words to Vogel are: Vogel, if you find God tell him we created... He was no longer an atheist in the strictest sense; he now even hoped their was a Creator and WANTED Vogel to find truth, love & happiness. But it was too late for him. Or maybe not?***END SPOILER***FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite the obvious flaws the film gets a huge 'A' for effort in my book. The Last Valley is a special picture. It successfully creates a small world of people some 400 years ago in a secluded vale in the paradisical wilderness of the Alps. A world you can get lost in for 2 hours. The originality of the story and its inherent profundities, not to mention the fine cast, performances and surreal aspects, lift the film above a simple adventure yarn. It's unorthodox, enlightening, thought-provoking and ultimately moving. If you enjoy films like Apocalypse Now and Runaway Train, films that boldly attempt to go far deeper than the run-of-the-mill action/adventure flick, then be sure to check out The Last Valley. You won't be disappointed. In addition, it's a film you'll continue to glean from in future viewings. But, since this is a dialogue-driven picture, be sure to use the subtitles so you can understand the heavily accented dialogue. You'll get much more out of it.GRADE: A-",5,WHOA!,1096070400,"09 25, 2004",0.1835
