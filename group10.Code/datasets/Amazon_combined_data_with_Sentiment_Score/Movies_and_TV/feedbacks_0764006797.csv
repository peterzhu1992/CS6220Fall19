0,A12XW27OP0CUR,764006797,carmenmiranda,"[8, 9]",I saw this movie years ago...forgot the name of it but through the wonders of the internet was finally able to find it again. If you like understated acting and a good story it is as fine a movie as you'll ever see. Robert Duvall is so good...he just flies right below the radar with his performance and is deeply affecting. This is an example of incredible storytelling that is often missing in today's hit-you-over-the-head-with-the-plot-and-special-effects movies.,5,Haunting movie...,1164499200,"11 26, 2006",0.1098

Fortunately, I obtained a copy of this film from Amazon[.com] before it became unavailable. I love Faulkner, and this adaptation of one of his short stories is both profound and simple at the same time. Stellar performances by all, including the director, in creating such a moving testament to love and loss which defines us as living human beings.

4,A3GTF3Q8KJ265C,764006797,K. Williams,"[7, 33]","Duvall appears to reprise his catatonic role fromTO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. This time, however, he is the main character. (Gasp!) There is virtually no action in this B+W movie that is about 45 minutes too long. (One hour should be sufficient.) Most of the movie takes place within a 15-foot square decrepit shack. Fentry (Duvall) is an uneducated man with zero personality or close friends who learns to acquire compassion through unexpected life events. Drudgery is punctuated by vignettes of relatively brief inopportune happiness. Due to unavoidable circumstances, Fentry was able to keep few of his promises but all of his loyalty.The story is compelling but -- due to the drab character portrayed by Duvall -- could have been told in a shorter amount of time; apparently the director wanted the audience to learn endurance or loyalty first hand.Sometimes the best advice is restraint. I gambled over 20 bucks based on glowing reviews and the fact that Duvall is a respected actor. However this led to quite a disappointment. I could not imagine viewing this entire movie more than once. If you are a fan of Duvall, do yourself a favor and rent the DVD. You'll likely only view this one time so do not make a big financial investment in it.",3,Long version of short story,1141689600,"03 7, 2006",0.1222
5,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,764006797,Linda Linguvic,"[73, 75]","This 1972 film, starring Robert Duvall before he became famous, is a real find. Based on a short story by William Faulkner, the play as well as the screenplay were written by Horton Foote, of To Kill a Mocking Bird fame. Naturally, it's set in Mississippi in the days when mules and buggies were used for transportation, and old men still remembered fighting in the Civil War.Robert Duvall is cast in the role of Jackson Fentry, a simple cotton farmer who takes on a job of caretaker at a sawmill during the winter months. It's a lonely place, and he lives in a shack, but there's a water pump outside and a wood stove to cook on, and he's used to a hard life. He hears a low moan outside one day, and discovers Sarah Eubanks, played by Olga Bellin, who is weak and pregnant and needing care. She's been abandoned by her husband and has no place to go. Both of them are quite shy and their meeting, in which he invites her in to his shack, is a small masterpiece of nuance. She has large expressive eyes and they both talk very slowly, but I never felt bored and easily adjusted to the pace.During the next few months their life together becomes idyllic but there is always an underlying tragic feel to their happiness. Marry me Sarah, he says. But alas, she can't; she's already married. As the story moves on, it gets sadder and sadder and, when, twenty years later, he's called to be a juror in a murder trial, we all understand why his vote causes a mistrial. It's a fitting conclusion, although not a happy one.This is perhaps one of Robert Duvall's greatest roles; one that he has said in interviews is still his favorite. It required excellent acting ability and he certainly demonstrated it. Throughout, we identify completely with the simple farmer with his deep regional southern accent. Olga Bellin is also excellent, but, with the exception of two minor roles on television, this was her only film. The screenplay is perfect also, using language that was natural to the characters. And the simple black and white cinematography sets the mood just perfectly. All together, this is a small gem and not to be missed by those who love good drama. Just be forewarned about the sadness.

Tomorrow could mean anything, but I don't think such a title would ever fit another story as well as this one. I won't ruin it for you and tell you why, since it is the last line of the film that reveals it and it is one of the most appropriate endings I've ever seen.Faulkner, Foote and Duvall, what a line up! Throw in the lumninous Olga Bellin as the lead actress and you couldn't lose with this one if you tried. That is of course unless you are one of the people whose idea of a great film is today's mind numbing fast food of cinema called special effects. The 'special effects' in this one are those you will carry with you after viewing a story of love and true nobility of character.How two people with so little in the world and so little knowledge of the world, could be so eloquent and say so much with the simplest of words, quietest of gestures, always amazes me. If what you want is a story of quiet beauty and grace that will make you feel better about life after you've seen it, then get your own copy of Tomorrow, for you'll want to see it more than once.We are lovers of fine filmmaking and finer writing and if we could only own five films (heaven forbid!) this would be one of them!

I think that any length would be too long.Yes, the acting is excellent, but in order to create a good movie you absolutely must start with a good script. This one just drags on and on. I stayed with the movie all the way to the end, thinking that, with all the 5-star reviews, there must eventually be something to this boring story.

A murder happens on-screen but nothing graphic or closeup.STARRING-Robert Duvall. Screenplay by Horton Foote.THEME-Unconditional love and compassion.STORY-Based on a short story by William Faulkner, the film opens with the brief flashback of a night scene where a young man and woman are apparently trying to elope without her parent's knowledge. The family is aroused and the young man is shot and killed by the father. The camera then moves to the courtroom of a small Mississippi town where a murder trial is in its final argument stage. As the defense wraps up its final argument, the camera pans the jury zooming in on Jackson Fentry (Duvall). When he casts the lone vote against acquitting the father resulting in a hung jury, the defense attorney wonders why would this man vote against 11 of his peers, in this his first trial as a lawyer. The rest of the movie tells us why by taking us back 20 years in the life of Fentry. Duvall is at his best in his role of Jackson Fentry, an introverted cotton farmer who leaves his father's farm to be the watchman at a rural sawmill about 30 miles from home. We see a tragic and touching love story between Duvall and a young, pregnant woman who has been deserted by her husband. In Duvall you see man's capacity for love and to do good. In the end we also experience man's capacity for evil and to do harm to his fellow man. This is not a fast-paced action film with lots of special effects but the acting is outstanding and well worth watching. Lu G. for Lu's Reviews 9/15/2007.

9,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,764006797,Luan Gaines luansos,"[5, 6]","The drama opens in a Mississippi courtroom in the early 1900s, an attorney pleading with a jury to find his client innocent of murdering a young man, claiming the man was defending his daughter's honor. Jury deliberation is shanghaied by one man, Jackson Fentry (Robert Duvall), causing a mistrial. The attorney makes it his business to learn more about Fentry, a story beginning twenty years earlier, declaring, If I knew then what I know now, he would never have sat on this journey. Based on Horton Foote's adaptation of a story by William Faulkner, Fentry is a solitary, taciturn man, hardly an anomaly in that period, survival accomplished with a minimum of comfort and much labor. Accepting a job as caretaker of a Tupelo sawmill, Fentry settles into a quiet existence, adapting easily to his circumstances.Preparing to walk to his father's farm thirty-one miles away the day before Christmas, Fentry is distracted by moans originating in the sawmill. He discovers a pregnant woman (Olga Bellin), collapsed in exhaustion. Embarrassed by her predicament, the woman wants only to get my strength back before moving on, but Fentry senses her frailty, guiding her into his shack. She is clearly unwell. In an act of instinctive generosity, Fentry offers her shelter until the child is born. What ensues is a delicate, respectful relationship (Yessir, No, Ma'am), a compassionate loner offering protection to a woman abandoned by her husband, cast out after her marriage by her father and three brothers. The emotional nuances between these two characters beautifully balanced, Sarah tentative and trusting, Fentry revealing a depth of character and capacity for love belied by his restricted circumstances. This gentle, frightened woman blossoms under the tender care of the stranger who offers shelter.As the birth draws near, Sarah speaks of her fear of dying, exacting a promise from Fentry that he will raise her child if something happens to her. After the birth, Fentry cradles the infant boy, declaring him my son; Sarah agrees to marry him since her lawful husband is in the wind. Thus pass the happiest days of Fentry's life, the boy the center of his existence until circumstances conspire against Fentry, his joy extinguished in one devastating afternoon until the scene in the courtroom twenty years later. Duvall is superb in Faulkner's dark drama, his spirit shining through a character with an infinite and previously untapped capacity for love. The dialog is simple, powerful in the hands of Duvall and Bellin, who embrace their brief encounter. Duvall transcends the screen, his monotone bringing to mind Billy Bob Thornton's inflections in Sling Blade (perhaps Thornton's inspiration?). Vivid against a stark landscape, Duvall creates magic, a touching, evocative film, a lonely man seizing an opportunity seldom encountered in his barren world.

10,AQE41QO3NEUMW,764006797,Ronald Scheer rockysquirrel,"[8, 8]","This is a movie for fans of a) William Faulkner, b) Horton Foote, c) Robert Duvall, and d) stage plays. Viewers unused to the pace of drama as written for the stage will find this adaptation of Foote's play slow and wordy. Confined mostly to the four walls of a shack, the action will seem claustrophobic at times. But the performances are wonderful, and Foote's always gentle vision of everyday people struggling for love and against loneliness makes the relationship between the story's two central characters poignant and touching.Meanwhile, Duvall's performance is compelling. The only thing distracting about it is not his fault but Billy Bob Thornton's, who obviously stole from it years later for the unforgettable role he plays in Slingblade. The early performances of so many actors show them still learning their craft, but the risks Duvall takes with his character shows him already an uncanny master of his art. Finally, Faulkner's world is given eloquent expression in this small black-and-white gem of a film, set in a kind of timeless place that his Mississippi represents. The DVD includes an interview with Duvall and Foote, made in 2003, and provides a number of interesting perspectives on the making of the film. Foote, for example, expresses reservations about the undue influence of the film's editor in the shaping of its final form, and Duvall describes a scene so crucial in his estimation that he would not see the film when the scene was cut.",4,Two lonely people . . .,1203638400,"02 22, 2008",0.1858

It's a searching, involving film that invites reflection. Looking back, the movie seems like a poem. It brought to mind Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (on pity), and the Beatitudes.Tomorrow is so well done in so many ways that the faults I find are just nit picking. But I do wish there were subtitles (or at least closed captions) for us old folks.IMDb has some very interesting reviews. The DVD borrowed through my local library came complete with a copy of Faulkner's short story, but there is also an excellent book that includes essays, conversations with people who made the film, and the full texts of story, TV play, and movie. The book is Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, by David Yellin and Marie Connors.In the interview, Foote and Duvall are interesting as they look back together at the making of the movie. Duvall mentions an important scene that didn't make the final cut.Tomorrow is a wonderful, moving film. Viewers who don't mind the quietness and the slow pace will treasure it.UPDATE--GOOD NEWS!
