Sesame Street shows kids in wheelchairs and kids with Down Syndrome on the show, I guess they should not be on the show either????So, I think he is a welcome addition to the video. Check your attitudes at the remote before playing the video for your kids if you feel that way-it may be annoying to adults-but it is what the kids can relate to and understand that matters.",5,I'd vote for it twice!!!!!,1109808000,"03 3, 2005",0.2949

However, the ad in teh front is REALLY ANNOYING. You can't skip it, you can't fast-forward through it, and my kids really don't give a flying flip that the purchase of this video supports Sesame Street. Neither do I anymore.

I didn't give the video five stars because I find Baby Bear to be annoying, but I suppose that is a matter of personal preference. Overall, the music is entertaining and the DVD was a useful tool in helping my daughters learn the alphabet.",4,"Short, Sweet, Educational",1197504000,"12 13, 2007",0.351

My two year-old loves this DVD and I have to admit, I enjoy it too. He can barely talk but knows most of the letters of the alphabet. He sings along and recognizes most of the letters and can sing most of the alphabet song. I work with him, of course, but he's gotten a lot from this video. I highly recommend to any parent of toddler or pre-schooler. It is one you will watch over and over with your child and be amazed at the results. The songs are fun. You hear the letters of the alphabet over and over but in different ways. Really great.",5,Buy this one,1062460800,"09 2, 2003",0.2911

He's been watching it since he was 13 months and he still enjoys it. However, its purely an entertainment thing for him. He also has the Learning About Letters DVD since he was smaller, and same thing--totally entertainment. Story line is not a really issue for him.

I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway, that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own...PS - yay, Sesame Street!",4,A humble suggestion...,1127606400,"09 25, 2005",0.5634

Big Bird and Baby Bear work on learning the abc's. Baby Bear wants to learn them because Goldilocks gets on his nerves, butting-in and finishing them for him when he gets stuck. When Goldilocks pops in, it's pretty funny. Not a good video if your child only craves Elmo though. He does NOT appear in this video.

12,A39UPRGT8Z0AIE,738920770,Jaina Solo jainasolo@aol.com,"[67, 73]","We own this on DVD, purchased for a few bucks only--about all it is worth. We own most of the Sesame Street videos, including all the various clips collections like this one. I have to say Do the Alphabet is only one step above the dreadful Elmocize. Okay, so I'm not the target audience--but my kids don't really care for it either!From the worst period in Sesame Street production (in my opinion)--the late 80s/early 90s-- this video features Baby Bear trying to learn the alphabet in one day, so he can one-up the annoying Goldilocks (I kind of miss her, actually--she was at least comical, whereas contemporary Zoe is just bratty in an unamusing way).Songs from Billy Joel and whatnot date this one--the best part is the classic Sesame clips, such as the Ernie/Cookie monster song about D (gotta love it!).The most amusement I get from this DVD is that it stands out as one of the few muppet-involved videos when you can actually SEE the PUPPETEER! Watch Prairie Dawn during the You Can Say The Alphabet song . . . the crate and the kids do not quite cover the puppeteer's hand and head. You can see them over and over--something very rare in Sesame Street videos!Bored parents can also watch for the rare sight of some of the Sesame kids arguing during a segment--watch Michael and the other boy when the kids are doing their letter exercises--too funny. Who was directing this? Had they stopped caring?My kids, now age 5 and 3, would rank this very low for entertainment value. WE only pull it out when we've done the other Sesame Street videos to death. If you're shopping for a Sesame Street fan, go for one of the anniversary celebrations or the good ol' Best of tapes like Best of Elmo, Cookie Monster's Best Bites etc.I need to add here that I consider myself a big Sesame Street fan--I grew up with it, bought the classic tapes even before I had kids (does that make me a weirdo?), raised my kids on it. From babyhood, my kids knew their letters, numbers, shapes, colors, etc. very well, and Sesame Street had a big part in that. I love their work and love to see a well-produced, well-written Sesame tape. This just isn't one.",3,One of the more painful Sesame Street DVDs...,1134000000,"12 8, 2005",0.1392

It's filled with good and catchy songs, entertaining cartoons about the different letters, good live segments (as in using real people instead of being a cartoon), and a great story to tie it all together.My 16-month old daughter is already starting to sing along with the first song (ABC-DEF-GHI), dances along with the T-dance skit, and beats her hands in time with the jazzy Alphabet Blues. She still isn't really able to talk (not having a decent set of teeth yet makes it hard to say certain letters), but I have a feeling that once she does she'll be saying the whole alphabet in short order.",5,A great video for older infants/young toddlers!,1012867200,"02 5, 2002",0.667

I only rate it a 3 because it is not a show I enjoy watching with my daugher. I also don't notice her laughing and being engrossed with the story the way she does with Franklin videos, Bear in the Big Blue House videos, and even Elmo videos. I also don't particularly care for the Baby Bear character either, because he doesn't speak well (they have him speak in &quot;baby&quot; talk which means he mispronounces certain letters.) We've had this video for about 8 months and my daughter never requests it anymore. Maybe she's too old (28 months), but I doubt it.

Having Baby Bear get stuck at a different letter each time really works - my two-year-old occasionally finishes the letter for him.This video has better between-clip production values than some Sesame Street videos - but die-hard Sesame Street fans will want to see it's songs like J Joe Jeans and his Jellybeans, and, my favorite - Henson and Frank Oz as Ernie and COOKIE MONSTER doing D.

Forget the old way of singing your abc's ... this movie will change the way you sing it for good! So catchy! My daughter loves this movie. It's one of her favorite in the Sesame Street series.
