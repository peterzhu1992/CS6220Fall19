0,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,767005880,Andrew Raker,"[2, 2]","I have never read Henry Fielding's novel in full, and therefore, I am not exactly certain how he portrays his characters in each scene. However, I have read the SparkNotes on this novel as well as Fielding's own words that he desired the novel to be like a feast to the reader. I also know that the literary society did not take kindly to Fielding's novel due to its vulgar content.This production of Tom Jones certainly is vulgar in comparison with many other A&E; or BBC productions. Yet, I do not think the film does so against the novel. The novel does not use the best language, and while producers of films much always decide how much action to TELL/IMPLY and how much to SHOW, I do not think this production shows too much.Fielding's novel is not like a work of Charles Dickens or Jane Austen. Therefore, the production should not try to transform Fielding's style into that of a more modest and politically-correct writer.As for the acting of the characters, I believe most actors conveyed their characters well. The film was certainly humorous, which I am sure was the intent of the productors. Additionally, the film kept the introductory passages were an actor playing Fielding speaks about the work.Overall, I do not regret purchasing and watching this production. I thought it was quite good - a mix between a drama and a comedy, where manners are neglected and violence abundant, but all in a way that seems like a 1960s TV comedy show.PS: Even the scenes where characters are intoxicated or lose their tempers do not appear too graphic. I am of the opinion most high school students have been at parties were more realistic drunkenness occured than this production shows. As for the violence between characters, especially between Squire Western and his daughter, Sophia, I am rather convinced that 21st century X-box and Playstation games contain just as much violence - and violence that appears more real than any shown in this film.",4,comedy of manners and violence,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",0.1991

Brian Blessed should have gotten an Academy Award for his performance as Squire Western. He was humorous, horrifying and tender - at times, all at once. A splendid piece of acting. I actually do prefer this to the other more well known version of the film with Albert Finney. The filming itself, the costumes and truth to the original writing make this a far superior filming of Tom Jones.",5,Tom Jones - Classic Literary Films,1289001600,"11 6, 2010",0.5214

5,A2XA9PCCNS8UA8,767005880,Elisabeth Altieri,"[84, 87]","&quot;It is a pity he was not immortal, he was so formed for happiness.&quot; -- Mary Wortley Montagu on the death of her cousin, Henry Fielding.This dramatization of this most wonderful book is nearly perfect. I say nearly perfect because that are one or two little problems with the sound (no, Honour doesn't mean she wouldn't say a word if Sophia were to go to bed with Mr. BLIFIL instead of Mr. Jones, nor does Miss Western mean to say, &quot;Brother, if you would only leave your NIECE to my care...&quot;) but never mind that. It doesn't matter because the director, Metin Huseyin, has his fingers on the pulse of 18th century England. It's not a &quot;bawdy romp.&quot; It was really like this. Straight, nonintoxicated Englishmen hugged and kissed each other in public (a show of feeling was considered a mark of a gentleman). People talked more openly about sex than they did for another 175 years, the fact that women liked it too, and the fact that sex is, every once in a while, a motive for human behaviour. Women talked back and demanded respect. Hypocrisy was everywhere (and just like now, you could sometimes say so). About 140 crimes carried the death sentence. Money and property sometimes mattered more than people. Young people sometimes had to marry the person they were told to marry whether they hated them or not, and being kind, generous and amiable could get you in worse trouble than being greedy, grabby and nasty. Fielding wrote it all down and Huseyin delivers it wonderfully well here.Tony Richardson's Tom Jones was splendid, to be sure, and is full of brilliant acting, but in many ways it was, to quote a friend of mine, rather like, &quot;Austen Powers does the 18th Century.&quot; This is Tom Jones as Fielding conceived him. A pretty, sweet fellow, probably based on Fielding's youthful self, who makes a few very human mistakes and, with the help of his enemies, nearly gets himself hanged.The casting in this production is marvellous and the director has, probably through his obvious great love for this story, allowed each actor to be infused with a faithful sense of character. Fantastic as Joyce Grenfell was, to the heavily Freudianized audiences of 1964, a character like Lady Bellaston could only be portrayed as a clinging nyphomaniac. Lindsay Duncan, on the other hand, is perfect as the mature, sexy, selfish, independently wealthy female who does exactly as she likes, a type of woman not unknown today and not unknown in the 18th century, either. (It was the Victorians and people in the first three quarters of the 20th century who claimed women like this were aberrations.) Peter Capaldi is great as the horribly funny Lord Fellamar. Partridge is rumpled, wronged and tender-hearted. The household parasites ARE odious, Brian Blessed IS Squire Western (complete with dog slobber and misguided parenting), Samantha Morton is perfect as Sophia, who in turn was based on Fielding's beloved wife, Charlotte; lovely, hot-tempered, brave and honest. As is true of all the casting, her long-suffering, imperfect maid and friend, Honour, is great. The child actors well match their grownup counterparts. Beesley is a good Tom and also has a nice bottom. John Sessions, who plays Fielding himself, our wry narrator, is a delight.This production is much closer to the original, including the dialogue, already in place by Fielding, who wrote dialogue for his novels like the dramatist that he was; so in a way it was already a screenplay. Some of the longer narrative passages had to be pared out, of course, but why both directors (Richardson and Huseyin) leave out the fact that Squire Allworthy sends his precious but disgraced Tom off, well provided for, with 500 pounds in his pocket, I don't know, but I'm sure they had their reasons. The sets may not be brilliant, but the costumes, make-up, acting and directing are. This is a wonderful production in the old BBC tradition. Get it and love it, because they aren't making them anymore. And if you think we won't suffer for this loss, then listen (as if you could avoid it) to the deafening whine that passes for so much of modern dramatic art. We need Henry Fielding as much now as they did then.",5,Henry Fielding's immortality,992736000,"06 17, 2001",0.3473

With the extreme heat over the weekend I finally got to see this and I can't believe it's taken me so long. What a splendid version of the novel, so smartly adapted and well acted by Samantha Morton, Max Beesley, Benjamin Whitlow, Ron Cook, Lindsay Duncan, Frances de la Tour, Peter Capaldi, John Sessions and others. This version captures the humor and the pathos of the novel and is much more satisfying than the film version with Albert Finney. I would have reigned in Brian Blessed's performance as the Western father character. Otherwise, I can recommend this wholeheartedly.

The costumes and some of my favorite characters that I've seen in other films made it become what it was meant to be. Especially Sofie's dad. That character was off the chain. He keep me laughing with how he gets so upset about anything that was not going his way or by his demands.

9,A33PNAQ33DGBJG,767005880,Michelle Polk,"[11, 37]",Disgusting movie that leaves nothing to the imagination. Sex scene after sex scene is all through this movie. It is degrading and gross. The only good thing about this movie was Tom's attidude outside of the bedroom. I can't recommend this movie to anyone.,1,Tom Jones...,1219363200,"08 22, 2008",-0.2293
10,A31CXEZDNUT3OF,767005880,The Busy Bee,"[10, 10]","First of all - I am surprised to find so many people gave this Tom Jones interpretation 1 star.... but I read those votes are due to 'sexual content' and incorrect rating of G.To be blunt: You will see breasts, some buttocks here and there, and at least one 'thrusting' scene, WHICH are ALL no more than a few seconds of film time, scattered throughout. Be assured, skirts cover thighs and other things...... so the smut vote is interpretation. If you prefer prim and proper A&E;/BBC...... be fairly warned.The nature of the scenes are indicative of how people behaved in those times - from the most dignified yet depraved courtiers to the lowly housemaids... Although A&E; is better known for their prudence, I found that acceptance of the scenes in this movie comes in stride with the rawness of the characters and the story, which is about scandals of THAT nature.That being said, I found the film enjoyably different. The way that the narration is done is very reminiscent of a Monty Python storytelling - where the narrator can be easily affected by the scenery/players, as well as comical interruptions to end or begin a scene. The storyline (History of a foundling) has SO many plot twists and turns, that although the end may be guessable - the means is highly entertaining in its complexity.Brian Blessed is a hilarious (and my favorite character) country squire boobie who is irrationaly blustering and bellowing. His conduct is ridiculous, but causes so much confusion and chaos, that it can't help but be amusing. Lindsay Duncan (HBO's Rome, Servillia) as the devious Lady Bellaston is fantastic - her seductive nature and relentless jealousy are a force to be reckoned with. All the actors do a superb job.All in all, I found the film to be charming. It ISN'T your typical pristine BBC or A&E; production, and it should have been rated PG-13 or R, but I believe Henry Fielding wrote the racy story in a bawdy manner to begin with. I enjoyed its hilarious confusion and earthy interpretation, with an open mind.",5,Racy interpretaion... if you can look past that - Entertainment and Hilarity,1234224000,"02 10, 2009",0.2685
11,A14IZYCM6C5G3S,767005880,Timothy B. Holt Go into the western sea,"[9, 10]","I really have to place this production of a very human work of comic delight at the top of my list. Gilbert and Sullivan's Sorcerer is a companion to it and so is Iolanthe. I now know why my dear father told me to read Tom Jones when I was a teenager long ago (he also worshiped Iolanthe). I found it too stilted and of the age it was written. Now I see that it was not that it had lessons of life but that it was so much fun when you know life well (i.e. youth will not understand how funny it is)! And here you have it. Benjamin Whitrow as the father (same in the definitive Pride and Predudice production) is so endearing and loving and wise (much like my own dear Dad was). And all the romp with music to match and John Sessions filling in as the commenting Henry Fielding. I believe my sentence is for life and it is to watch this production yearly till death. The music, the actors, the screenplay, the direction, setting (landscape, buildings, dress, etc) are all perfect. Brian Blessed as Sophies dad is so ... well just see it. Thanks All you hard working folks who created this. It was based on a tale from a very humane judge of four hundred years ago and will last as a visual play of his work for another four hundred years. You have created a true lasting masterpiece. Thanks!!!For all the prudes who are horrified by the morality of this period of England I feel sorrow. Perhaps watching Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe might wake you up to how hard your ancestors had life and that being a good person really means not being cruel to others in the end. Caring in the face of suffering high and low. Morality is so often an excuse for cruelty.
