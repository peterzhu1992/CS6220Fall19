1,AVT9Q9PTUCDMR,767018672,Brian Maitland,"[2, 4]","As a kid I remember The Avengers being a lot better. First of all, you look at the DVD cover and it's in color so surely the shows are. Nope, they are in black and white.You go online and you can find out why so I won't waste time here about that. Just Wiki The Avengers and read how bizarre TV was back in the Uk at the time. But, hey, how about putting the original B&W; on here as is and adding colorization versions? Given there are zero extras on this set, how about spending some money when you release old TV shows on DVD.The episodes are slow. Something I certainly don't recall as my memory seemed to be episodes that had plenty of spy-like action. Again, no.Now the witty repartee between Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) and John Steed (Patrick MacNee) still is pretty good but it's laughable now in many ways in its '60s sexual innuendos.Maybe I got the three slowest and most plodding episodes but I also found the protagonist very one dimensional. The first episode has a randy Welsh horse trainer cum murdering minion who is cringe inducing in his performance. The other episodes are not much better.Get this Volume 1 gets you all of three episodes. That's all. Come on! Put the entire 1966 series on one DVD boxed set. This is marketing nonsense releasing it as three separate DVDs. I can see that if it's a series that's modern in the 2010s but for a series that in approaching 50 years' old, don't be so chintzy. After all, who is buying these series--not 20-year-olds. Cut the hardcore fans who will now be in their 50s or 60s a break.Anyway, I hope the other volumes are better as I found in these Diana Rigg was very underutilized and the action scenes very flat. The plots were also very dated. Sad all around really.",2,does not age like a fine wine,1313020800,"08 11, 2011",0.0755

Good action, good subtle humor and lots of that indomitable British flavor. It also helps one to see how he has changed. I find it to be good light entertainment.

3,A3GQKB1KF0CRPE,767018672,"Deborah MacGillivray Author,","[17, 18]","First set of 1967. This saw the Avengers to go colour and more episodes. These are some of the best Avengers, where the pairing of Mackee and Rigg well settled into their roles, with great scripts, really playful story lines.1) The See-Through Man - Steed Makes a Bomb - and Emma is put to sleep has Emma and John fighting an enemy agent, ala invisible man, but our pair knows seeing is not always believing2) The Bird Who Knew Too Much - Steed Fancies Pigeons - And Emma gets the bird has a villain using carrier pigeons to further his evil plans and the object isn't birdseed!3) The Winged Avenger - Steed goes bird watching - and Emma does a comic strip. This episode one of my favs, has a comic strip avenger come to life to seek vengeance. Jack MacGowan makes a guest role that is great fun.4) From Venus With Love Steed is shot full of hole - and Emma sees Stars The British Venusian Society is brewing a conspiracy that Steed and Emma must foil5) The Fear Merchants - Steed puts out a light - Emma takes a fright Businessmen go on a retreat to relax, instead come back to die, actually being frightened to death by their phobias. It's up to Steed and Emma to find out who is behind this deadline plot6) Escape in Time - Steed Visits a barber - and Emma has a close shave One of the best episodes has criminals escaping the law by going back in time. The costumer has Emma meeting Matthew Tyson who puts Emma into stocks.Classic episodes with the stories, acting and tongue-through-cheek antics at their best. Directing turns done by Roy Baker, Gordon Flemying and Robert Asher.",5,1st set of 1967 - sheer perfection,1097452800,"10 11, 2004",-0.0983

I'm really sorry I haven't seen this series earlier.It's weird watching the black and white episodes after you're used to watching the color shows. But color added a surreal touch to the show: Emma Peel's sometimes futuristic wardrobe comes to life and, it seems, the plots got more far out (then again, 1967 was a very far out year).I'm glued to every episode of The Avengers and wish TV shows nowadays could be as interesting.",5,John Steed and Emma Peel ROCK!,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",0.1599

6,A298D6BLPSPGHI,767018672,Fantasy Lore,"[10, 10]","I grew up watching these black and white Emma Peel Avenger episodes in the UK. But when I came to search for them on Amazon.co.uk I could only find entire collections that were both expensive and rare. I was really surprised when I found exactly what I was looking for here on the American version. Obviously it's the American market where the Avengers is popular enough to get the all-star treatment in these relatively cheap and good quality dvd sets spanning the entire Avengers archive. This, off course, was my 1st purchase- the introduction of (cross her at your peril!) Mrs. Emma Peel.While these 6 Avenger missions can veer into the ridiculous and times have obviously changed since 1965, amazingly these stories are still completely valid, yet surreal investigations into the under-belly of criminal Britain. You couldn't reproduce the magic of the show for a modern audience, as the Avengers movie certainly proved, but thankfully you can still watch the original episodes as if no time had passed and be thoroughly immersed in the strangeness that is the Avengers' world.My impression of this 1965 set (beginning the Steed-Peel partnership) is that these are not the best of their collaborations (obviously the best is yet to come and I'll definitely be acquiring those very soon). But this isn't because Diana Rigg takes time to adjust to the part (far from it- right from the outset she makes her role as Steed's equal partner in crime-solving her own)- it's more that my personal episode favourites come later on in her tenure. Although that's not to say that these episodes aren't inventive, thrilling and involving, because they are- VERY much so and I would definitely advise you to begin your Avengers DVD collection with this little gem that has weathered the past 40 years incredibly well indeed.Episode (1) 'The Town of No Return'A great Cold war-influenced story with a horror-movie feel- 8/10Episode (2) 'The Gravediggers'Peppered with quintessentially English set peices, it's funny and inventive!- 8/10Episode (3) 'The Cybernauts'A mad inventor, an unstoppable fighter and high-kicking action from Emma!- 9/10Episode (4) 'Death at Bargain Prices'A department store conspiracy, but light on originality and tension- 6/10Episode (5) 'Castle De'Ath'Atmospheric and intriguing (if somewhat plodding)- the under-cover routine is still proving a winner (plus, the ending is pure Avengers class!)- 7/10Episode (6) 'The Master Minds'Emma in a nurse's costume along with hypnosis and anarchy in the aristocracy- interesting/confusing/amusing, but a bit slow- 6/10",4,Not just Nostalgia!,1104883200,"01 5, 2005",0.0254
7,A2HIWDD2TDXS19,767018672,F. Gentile,"[14, 16]","I have been a huge fan of this series since first seeing it as a kid. My admiration has not diminished for this groundbreaking series. Leave it to the classy Brits to come up with the first strong woman of television. The first time I saw Diana Rigg as Mrs. Emma Peel, I was hooked. Don't get me wrong, I loved Patrick Macnee as John Steed, so cool in his fabulous English suits and walking stick. But, it was Mrs. Peel that had me fascinated. Oh, the excitement I'd feel when she donned one of her skin-tight body suits, then you KNEW a battle was soon to follow. One of the best things about this series, and one that was remarkable for that time, was the equality of both their characters. Steed had total respect for Mrs. Peel, and she got him out of many scrapes, usually dispatching her opponent with a few karate chops. To see a woman, indeed an incredibly sexy woman, display strength, power, intelligence, and beauty, all in one portrayal, was absolutely unheard of at that time. What they had is called CHEMISTRY, and, it is rare. Though partners against the evil forces that be, who used their brains as much as their physical prowess, their underlying flirtation with each other via witty repartee never waned, and was a big part of their success. I must admit to sadness when Diana Rigg's Mrs. Peel left the series. I tried to get into the new character, a lovely Brit girl whose name was, I think, Linda Thorson(?). But, no, Mrs. Peel was irreplacable, my heart was broken, and I, like many, abandoned the series from that point on. Though this dvd contains one of my favorite episodes, The Cybernauts, I still intend on getting the entire Mrs. Peel collection, it's on my future must-have list. This series also had one of my all-time favorite intros, it excites to this day. Maybe those younger will not totally appreciate the lack of computerized special effects of this time period. But, for me, there was more excitement, beauty, and intelligence in Diana Riggs Mrs. Peel than in any Anjelia Jolie opus. Mrs. Peel remains the personification of Strong Woman, against whom all other strong-woman-glamour-pusses are measured.... yet pale.

Just watch the hat please. John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here.

10,A20JYIHL1W1U54,767018672,hille2000 hille2000,"[0, 0]","This was a great TV series. `The Avengers was a popular 1960's British fantasy-adventure series that focused on the exploits of a male-female duo in the service of the British government. The series underwent several changes of its female lead but its one constant male lead was John Steed always portrayed by the debonair Patrick Macnee (Originally the John Steed had two male partners but that format eventually changed). Kathy Gale portrayed by Honor Blackman became Steed's first female partner. However, when Honor Blackman departed the series and Diana Rigg entered as Mrs. Emma Peel, the show became an international sensation. Rigg brought sophistication, wit, charm and beauty, which hid her lethal and highly visual judo and karate abilities. Macnee and Rigg complemented each other beautifully with their carefree witty and charming exchange of dialogue. The show distinguished itself with bizarre and futuristic villains and fantastic plots. Popular at the height of the James Bond craze, the show was able to distinguish itself with its simply over-the-top visual style. Laurie Johnson's catchy and sophisticated main title theme matched the visuals of the show and still conjures up an image of the series when listened to today. When Diana Rigg left the series, Linda Thorson entered as John Steed's new partner Tara King. The series soon went off the air in the United States. It was a shame because the episodes with Tara King were quite good. The King episodes seemed to be a little more down to earth and contained some very good writing and intricate plotting. In any event series definitely left its mark amongst the finest. These DVD copies are gorgeous.",5,Bring the 67 John Steed and Emma Peel Avengers Back,984441600,"03 13, 2001",0.4041

How such elaborate stories are tautly scripted into 50-minutes TV installments with amazing results is one of the major reasons of the Avengers' success. One-liners are so skillfully cued to the next scenes that they deliver the desired effect, be it humorous, suspenseful, or any other. Combining mystery, suspense, humor, irony, sci-fi elements, spoofs on spies and villains, playful seduction, the series delivers the perfect, unique mix that not only entertains but stimulates and nourishes the mind. Mrs. Peel, Steed and the other known and unknown guest stars, all deliver their lines and performances with detailed perfection. Seeing Mrs. Peel and Steed interact with each other is a delicious experience. They both remind us that delicate and demured sexuality are eternally most satisfying and stimulating.
