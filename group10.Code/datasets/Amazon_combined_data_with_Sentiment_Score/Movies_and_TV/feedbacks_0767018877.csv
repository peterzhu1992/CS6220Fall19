Here are the breakdowns (including episode #s () and individual sketch names). Why? Well, because I'm a nerd.DVD 5 - (14) Face the press/new cooker sketch/prostitute advert/the ministry of SILLY WALKS/The piranha brothers - (15) Man powered flight/the SPANISH INQUISITION/jokes &amp; novelties salesman/tax on thingy/photos of uncle ted/the semaphore version of wuthering heights/julius caesar on an aldis lamp/court charades - (16) A bishop rehearsing/flying lessons/hijacked plane/the poet McTeagle/psychiatrist milkman/complaints/DEJA VULoony Bin extras: Meet the chaps, Pythonisms, Gillianimations, Silly Walk (Live!), Naughty bits, pythonshop.com adDVD 6 - (17) Architect sketch/how to give up being a mason/insurance sketch/&quot;The BISHOP&quot;/living room on pavement/poets/a choice of viewing/chemist sketch/police constable pan-am - (18) Live from the grill-o-mat/&quot;BLACKMAIL&quot;/society for putting things on top of other things/escape from film/current affairs/accidents/seven brides for seven brothers/the man who is alternately rude and polite/ken clean-air system - (19) It's a living/the time on BBC1/school prize giving/films by Mr. Dibley/the news/free prizes/Timmy williams interview/Raymond LUXURY YACHT/getting married/ELECTION night specialLoony bin: same as DVD 5 except for - A trivial quest, Gilliam's attic, Monty queries, and Tutor mannersThat about sums it up. I know there are no episode titles and probably some other little things included but...well, too bad.

He really isn't that talented a performer in these senses.",2,"Pythons can't dance, especially Terry Jones!",1103414400,"12 19, 2004",-0.3462

Episodes like &quot;Face The Press&quot; are an excellent way to introduce others into the wonderful world of Python. If you are a firm believer in political correctness, skip anything done by Python, as their work will offend you greatly. But then again, the politically correct are devoid of a sense of humor in the first place, so why would they be shopping in the comedy section?Hardcore fans and newcomers alike will appreciate the digital sound, because it makes hearing the punchlines possible even through heavy audience laughter. Buy them now! You won't regret it.",5,"Must have for MPFC fans, or anyone that is a bit mental...",957225600,"05 2, 2000",0.4263

I only paid 3.98 total for this item brand new from a seller on amazon and it was so perfect for a last minuite, for the hell of it gift for my husband on our first anniversary. It is pretty damn funny in my opinion. You can't go wrong with buying this set.",5,Worth the price.,1254355200,"10 1, 2009",0.3542
