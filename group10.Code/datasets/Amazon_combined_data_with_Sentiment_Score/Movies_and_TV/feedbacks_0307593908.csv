0,ATKL8C5IQ56E9,307593908,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","This is an awesome instructional video. Julie covers nearly every cooking technique you can think of live in front of you in her down-to-earth way. It is so refreshing to watch her again after all these years! She could be your mom or aunt right there teaching you what you need to know. I just love the 80's footage--there is a Corning Ware Visions pan that Julia uses-I remember buying a set of these. They actually are great for demonstrating cooking since you can see through them! But I digress--these are the must have recipes in the poultry, meat, vegetable categories etc. with accompanying printed recipe book. They build on one another and are explained very well with great camera angles. She explains not only the recipes themselves but any type of prep, slicing, dicing, etc. that is necessary to start the recipe. I even got use to her voice!If you are a beginning to intermediate cook or just want a good review, you must get this from the Master herself!",5,don't watch while you are hungry!,1283904000,"09 8, 2010",0.2808
1,A2IKWMHSHKRLGG,307593908,Carlos A. Melendez,"[1, 1]","This has to be by far the BEST cooking DVD. Believe me when I tell you, if you buy this you will need no other.There are two DVDs that include :Poultry, Meat, Vegetables, Soups, Salads, Bread, Fish, Eggs, First Courses and Dessert. To give you an example on how the DVDs and classes work:Every class has a number Example: Sauteed Chicken is 101, you watch her prepare it, if for example there is an ingredient like saut&eacute;ed mushrooms that needs to be added then that preparation is 103, you can then stop and go to 103 and see how it's prepared, that way once you know how to prepare a recipe and want to just watch the steps, you don't have to watch every single step , just what you need. And for example after saut&eacute;ed chicken come recipes that have that same chicken as the base, so once you know how to saut&eacute; chicken you can then move on to Coq au vin or chicken with mushrooms and cream or chicken provencal, etc. all with saut&eacute;ed chicken as base. And believe me with Julia preparing you feel like you can do any of those recipes. She makes you feel very confident.The DVDs also come with a booklet, and not just a crummy pamphlet but a booklet with every recipe in the DVDs.I really believe that every household should have this, it is such an easy way to come together as a family and have dinner with great food that doesn't take forever to prepare in most cases. Forget fast food, here you have very good food made very quickly and you know each and every ingredient that goes into it.Bon app&eacute;tit!",5,Julia Child is the best.,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",0.3083
2,A1157CR0T5UM9D,307593908,Evelyn Uyemura,"[29, 50]","Julia is delightful, as always. However, the cooking here is very basic and rather repetitive. In the meat section, you learn how to pan fry a steak and how to deglaze the pan and make a sauce. Then you have essentially the same thing for a pork chop and a veal cutlet. You learn how to make a pot roast, followed by the same instructions but with chunks of meat to make beef stew. In the vegetable section, you learn how to boil various vegetables and finish them off with a dab of butter. Very basic. Lots of butter, heavy cream, and wine or vermouth added to almost every dish. The videography is not very well-lit for close-ups, so some of the food looks rather unappealing. I think this would be useful for someone who wants to cook basic American food and only knows how to microwave. But if you are already buying fresh ingredients and putting meals on the table, this will not really teach you much.",3,Not that Great,1262476800,"01 3, 2010",0.1115

I don't consider myself a novice cook, but I even got some techniques and tips from it. I think just being in the presence of Julia is a good thing, like her teaching continues even though she is still not with us.The quality of my dvd's are just fine, not sure why that other reviewer had issues with the quality. I wish Julia had done a series of vidoes. Now you can only get a few of the old episodes of her French Chef cooking show. Guess they didn't think of it back then.This is a great video for beginners and I think a great price, under $11.",4,"Basics, still good",1344643200,"08 11, 2012",0.3886

5,A1MRRT9U3E7L3N,307593908,Mark Schildberg Renaissance Person,"[1, 1]","Cooking was a haphazard skill for me until I read Julia Child's The Way to Cook. There are thousands of books that teach recipes, but very few about techniques. That is where Mrs. Child breaks from most cooking instructors and where she leaves an important mark.By explaining, quickly and simply, the most useful methods in the preparations of foods, she makes clear, with positive attitude, enthusiasm and reassurance, how the novice cook can prepare meals expertly.The accompanying video series, now on DVD, does not have all the recipes listed in the book (that would take years to go through), but the techniques are all here, well organized and easy to master. I recommend both these videos and the book itself, for the latter goes into deeper details on how the theme-and-variation approach to recipes helps demystify cooking.Julia Child made a significant difference in my life.

The DVD is very user friendly, easy to navigate and beautiful in it's simplicity yet astounding in the amount of basic cooking techniques demonstrated! There are nearly 60 recipes on each of the Discs. The recipe booklet included with the 2 DVD Set is fantastic. Seeing each recipe come together- step by step - live and in living color is extremely helpful along with knowing what the end result is supposed to look like! I can only wish I had had such a resource when I was a novice cook over 40 yrs ago! What a wonderful gift idea for a bridal shower, new college student or housewarming for a newbie starting out on their own.The Way To Cook DVDI never tire of listening to Julia's distinctive voice and watching her friendly, non-fru-fru mannerisms coupled with her impeccable class as a lady, a chef and an instructor.

When this series first aired in the mid 80's, I remember watching it to learn the essentials of food preparation and short cuts. The very day I found out it was available, I immediately preordered.This two DVD set comes with an instructional booklet. On the first, you will find Poultry, Meats and Vegetables. On the second, Soups, Salads and Bread, Fish and Eggs, and First Courses and Desserts. Both DVDs are well chaptered, so if you just want to watch one particular sub-chapter, you don't have to sift through an entire topic in order to do so. As always, Julia is instructive, professional and completely enthusiastic.

10,A3HJHV83O2U8BL,307593908,Robert A. Grossman,"[10, 11]","I just watched the first DVD on poultry and meat of this set and can understand why Julia Child is such a huge hit. She shows you how to take everyday grocery items and easily turn them into delicious entrees. I also bought the cook book set:Mastering the Art of French Cooking (2 Volume Set). It may turn out that all I need is this DVD, which by the way includes a recipe booklet for every recipe shown on the video. The video is very well organized and can teach even a complete novice how to make some splendid dishes. I'll start with the video and work my way into the two volume cookbook. I grew up with Julia Child but never watched her show with any regularity. I, like many others, watched the movie Julie and Julia and my interest got sparked. I notice the two volume cookbook set has crept up in price since I bought it. I'll bet before the movie I could have gotten it for half the price. That's fine though. With this DVD, I'll just place my laptop on a kitchen counter and follow the easy step by step instructions.What has been abundantly clear to thousands of people for years is that Julia Child knows how to cook. With this DVD what now also becomes abundantly clear is that she is every bit as excellent as a cooking teacher as she is a cook. To cook well is one thing. To teach well is something entirely different. Julia Child deserves to go down in history as she has and will continue to.",5,A little counter space and a laptop and you're off and running,1265414400,"02 6, 2010",0.2883
