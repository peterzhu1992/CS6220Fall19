I know from when I was in youth group that there are a lot of cliques in youth group and church, but church is not an exclusive club for those who fit a certain mold. This movie shows that we need to live out Christ's love and gives very practical ways. The movie flashes back to the story of Hosea and Gomer and really explains how much God loves us.

7,A3P876I6K3KL8V,740328271,C. Long,"[1, 1]","This movie is basically two stories in one and shows them intersecting. A small group of youth group kids go camping with their leader and wife and experience some inter-personal conflict. The leader starts to tell the story of Hosea and his wife Gomer from the Bible (with many liberties and assumptions taken). When this occurs, the movie switches to actually show that story unfold. Periodically, it comes back to the kids discussing what they're hearing before jumping back to the story. When it's all done, the impact of the story has an effect on the kids as they discover the depth of God's love for them and how they should extend that love to others. I found the way that this movie was done to be an excellent way to tell the story.Before watching this movie, I kind of expected it to be a bit cheesy and the acting to be poor. I must say that, although at times it seemed to skirt around the cheese line a bit, it never actually crossed it, and the acting - while not great - was doable. This definitely has a lower budget, t.v. movie type feel to it.All things considered, I felt this was a perfectly fine movie for what it was - and I left it feeling encouraged myself in God's love for me. I think this movie could be especially worthwhile to be shown to youth groups - as I actually thought the kids' performances came off reasonably well and I think other youth group kids will be able to relate. Because the Hosea/Gomer story does involve Gomer's unfaithfulness to Hosea, this may not be the best for really young children, but for appropriate ages, I think this could maybe work as a family night movie also.Reviewed by MoviesForChristiansmoviesforchristians dot org",4,Great for youth groups,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",0.1713

9,A32U6577WUD9L5,740328271,Donald James. Parker Author,"[2, 2]","The director used an interesting approach - showing an expanded story of Hosea and Gomer, which is not supported or denied by scripture, as a story being told by a youth group leader trying to demonstrate unconditional love toward a young lady who is struggling to fit in anywhere, especially at a campground with a bunch of church kids. At times the switchbacks are reminiscent of The Princess Bride as the youth group members interrupt the story being related to them to offer personal opinions about the unfaithful wife and her doting husband. The Hosea part of the filming was awesome - the youth group part not so much, but still commendable. This is definitely a film that should be shown in all youth groups.

13,A1EA7VXIUZBYIK,740328271,Jason Brown Dark-edged Apologist,"[3, 3]","Do you know who Greg Mitchell is? He is the author of The Coming Evil Trilogy, a Christian horror series that's very Biblically correct and accurate. Also the author of Rift Jump, a YA sci-fi book dealing with doubt and faith.Believe it or not, he also co-wrote the screenplay for this movie, and it was through him I found out about this film. And when I saw the movie, his brand of humor hat I could recognize from The Strange Man and Enemies of the Cross (from TCE) was definitely there, so I couldn't help but love it. But more than that, there was the story of a Book from the Bible that's not really discussed in the church for some strange reason. Hosea.When a youth pastor (Seasn Astin from The Goonies, Lord of the Rings, and numerous other films) and his wife (Erin Bethea, Kirk Cameron's wife) are ready to go on a camping trip, they find the number of kids coming with them rather short-handed. And one of them, a young, materialistic girl with a hard past who could care less about anything they do, is coming with them. While camping out, the kids (Carrie, Steve, Cooper, Gameboy, and Ashley) seem to be having a good time (except Ashley who immediately wants to go home) when an accident happens that further reveals how self-centric she is and hints at her hard past. When the youth pastor's wife suggests they show her unconditional love, it gives him an idea.An idea in the form of presenting a fully fleshed-out story of the Book of Hosea. And with the way he presents it, it's not only keeping with the Bible and how society was back then (Hosea being the lone faithful to God while all the other Jews of his time are relying on pagan gods, including his own wife), but showing how even God's love transcends above all the mistakes we make, no matter how devastating they can be for those they affect.At certain moments through the story, some of the youth present their opinions on how Hosea should've dealt with his wife, and I could recognize today's status quo of Once he/she makes a mistake, they have to be thrown out, and the youth pastor will further comment that that's not what God wanted. At times, he seems on the verge of sounding preachy, but luckily he doesn't (that's the good Samwise Gamgee for you!). Instead, he directs attention to how God lets Hosea know how to handle his unfaithful wife, and at time it does provoke confrontations with others in his community, even if not violently, sparks happen. Taunts come up. References to immediate economical well-being (and Hosea's prophecies of potential famine and drought) keep being mentioned, in comparison to Hosea's day-trade: making pottery. By the end of the story, despite how unfaithful his wife, Gomer, becomes, and how worthless the rest of the community sees her, it's what Hosea does in the end that caused tears to flow, and unashamedly. And with that came the context on how people today need God's love, without mincing the context nor sounding like some very typical church sermon (gotta hand it to Greg Mitchell, he never sounds preachy in his books, and the one time one character does try to sound preachy, it backfires in his face, in a darkly comical style).Independent? Yes, it shows. No, it doesn't matter. This film was worth getting and will be worth multiple watch-throughs.",5,Love through the ages worth remembering,1358985600,"01 24, 2013",-0.0118

16,A3VA7MACQJZPBT,740328271,Kelly Blackwell - Here's My Take On It Kelly,"[9, 9]","Ashley, Carrie, Cooper, Steve and Gameboy are all going on a youth group camping trip with their youth pastor, Stuart and his wife Beth. The kids are all pretty tight as many youth group kids are with the exception of Ashley. Ashley is a beautiful girl who has a bit of a self-centered attitude. She is going on the trip because her grandma is pushing her to go. Her attitude is to just get through it. This annoys Carrie to bits. She doesn't appreciate Ashley's snobbishness and has her own preconceived notions about the new addition. Steve however thinks that Ashley is just misunderstood and needs a chance. Of course with a big chip on her shoulder, Ashley doesn't make it easy for anyone to give her that chance. She feels no one understands her or what she has gone through.Things don't go terribly well with the kids and Stuart decides to share the story of Hosea and Gomer with the kids. The story of Hosea is a story of God's love for His stiff necked, rebellious and disloyal people.Amazing Love is two stories in one. The main one really is the telling of Hosea and Gomer. The secondary, story involving the kids really unfolds first. That part is good, but the real heart and soul that is going to get you is Hosea. What is cool though is how in the end, it all really intertwines so well together. Hosea learned how God felt when Israel turned their backs on Him and worshiped false idols. He felt it on the level of being a man married to and in love with a woman who was completely unfaithful to him. There was a line in the story that really hit home for me where Hosea is talking with God in anguished prayer not understanding how God would love this unlovable people who did not act loving toward Him. He said You love us because your love is not dependent on us. Awesome right?I am going to stop here in order to not give much away. Although let's face it, you can read Hosea and get the gist of that story, but this one is really told well. Yep, I kind of cried a bit.The movie does not have difficult themes for kids. I would say it a story that would be acceptable for about ages 12 and up. Just keep in mind that Gomer was not a very faithful chick. Nothing is seen but her unfaithfulness is obvious.",4,Good Film Great Message,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",0.1884

The only thing is ..i wish they would have explained harlot better and how back in that time period how big of a thing it really was. I dont see this as winning souls because without a background of understanding-it does not produce anything. BUT i can see this being used as a tool in sunday school or children's church to HELP give a visual of the story of Hosea. Also think this would be a GREAT movie for movie & popcorn night at the church (if the church ever did this). ALso great movie to show teens-but it is kind of slow and younger children will probably not be interested at all in this (age 10 and under). So to be perfectly honest -i am not sure sunday school or children's church would work all that well.Other than that--it is a good movie and will help people to dig a little deeper in the bible to find out why God told Hosea to go and marry a harlot-Gomer.,5,Great Story on Hosea.,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",0.6142

If you have not studied covenants, you will see the OT versions as well as the New covenant in & through Jesus Christ.God loves His people but time after time in Judges, Samuel, etc, God calls Israel His wife & His son due to their relationship to Him. But many times He has to say, you Stiff-necked people, Hebrews ,..& christians. We can go through the motions of worship, connection & servanthood to our Sovereign Lord but we must be aware of times we are proud, lazy or even deceptive (to ourselves) in our worship of God. This is the Hosea story. I won't elaborate because it's only 14 chapters long. Read it today & see how Godloves His people as Hosea love the harlot.
