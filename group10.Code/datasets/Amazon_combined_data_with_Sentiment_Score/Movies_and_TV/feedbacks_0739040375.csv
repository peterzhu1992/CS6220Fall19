0,A1R8OFZY6CYX7G,739040375,Howard L Lambert,"[3, 4]","Part 1 of this DVD is crammed with standard shred licks...but not much in the way of how, when and where to use them. In that respect, it's one of the more disorganized guitar instructional videos I've seen. Despite Paul's youth and enthusiasm,, the material gets relatively advanced rather quickly (and he can play the licks so fast and perfect, it's just as discouraging as inspirational).In Part 2, he sporadically mentions things that would be aimed at relative beginners...which definitely doesn't belong on these videos. On the other hand, Example #7 is so much more intricate/difficult than anything else on this disk, it seems out of place. The best thing on the whole disk are the 2-note per string/string skipping arpeggios (wish I woulda started practicing those 10 years ago). There are a couple of other cool licks, but the video ends up a mess of a lot of talking...my mind wandered.Before attempting to play along, you should already know all the major scale modes and the melodic minor scale. Your alternate picking should already be very controlled/synchronized and you should be experienced with string skipping. It also contains some extreme finger stretches/intervals that a lot of people might never be able to do (a shorter scale neck or extraordinary long fingers will come in handy here).If you don't already have the skills mentioned above, I highly recommend Don Latarski's Guitar Theory Basics and Frank Gambale's Chopbuilder be bought first. Sequentially, they'll introduce you to all the basic mode fingerings and get your alternate picking, control and speed somewhat closer to Paul's level.",2,"entertaining, but disorganized",1283126400,"08 30, 2010",0.3176

3,ALLHLOG4NLA0A,739040375,Ray St John Ray St John,"[0, 0]","This is the best purchase anyone can make if you want to shred being that finding a good teacher that can teach this skill is not easy. Paul besides being an incredible player covers all bases of Alternate Picking and String Skipping like he was in front of you. This is worth every singe penny. Now you have both instructionals on one DVD for the price of one!!!!I own a vast array of instructionals, and if you only had 17 dollars to spend on a dvd, this is the best money you'll ever spent. Paul teaches shred like he was in front of you and believe me, no one posseses that skill. I also recommend his other instructionals after you are ready to move forward from this one Terryfying Guitar Trip, Get Out Of My Yard and his latest, Silence Followed By a Deafening Roar.RATING 10",5,The Best Instructional For Guitar Shreddin' - PERIOD!,1169510400,"01 23, 2007",0.3534
4,A3DMR234MWQYSE,739040375,S. M. Barden,"[3, 4]","Gilbert is a master player and instructor - and I think we all know that those two things don't necessarily go together. His technique on this DVD is jaw dropping. I really don't think it would be possible to alternate pick faster with the clarity Mr. Gilbert brings to the instrument. Paul seems to have both sides of his brain fully developed - the artistic left side that rocks out with gut searing intensity and emotion, and the geeky analytical right side that can perfectly explain and break down why it all works. I own literally thousands of guitar instructional materials that I've purchased over the last thirty years, and can honestly say that this DVD ranks in the top three. If you are at all interested in shred guitar, you simply have to buy this. Many of us paid $40 or more per VHS tape for the original videos (parts I and II), so this DVD is an amazing bargain at this price. Thanks, Paul!",5,"Amazing, inspiring DVD",1204848000,"03 7, 2008",0.403
