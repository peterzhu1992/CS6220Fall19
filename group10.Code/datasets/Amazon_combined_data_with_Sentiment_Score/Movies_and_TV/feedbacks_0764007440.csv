Just ask Helen Capel the mute who resides in an overwhelming creepy and underlit mansion that a serial killer may strike next! Helen must muster all her courage and and some how over power and out wit her killer because she doesn't have the ability to yell for help due to the fact that she can't scream!! This film prays on the fear we all have of being left alone at home. We all laugh at horror films when the victim goes and checks the rumblings they may have just heard but when we are all home alone don't we do the same thing. Nobodody wants to be murdered but to be murdered in the confounds of your own home is hair raising torture.The film moves so slow that you actually want the violence of murder to take place maybe then the lightining outside and shadows of the mansion will lift and the tension in your heart will subside! The ending is just perfect and suits the film to a tee! The film uses fear in the most natural setting; just think about it, someone could be home with you and you could not even know it until they jump from out of the closet and strangle you! The scene with the killer watching his next victim from a hole in the closet is just as startling and claustrophobic as one can get.

A small space with a couple of dozen patrons on straight back wooden chairs, a pianist off to the right of a little screen and a hand-cranking projectionist (who's in the same room) all watch a melodramatic short called THE KISS.But that brief scene just introduces us to a bygone era. Soon after, this delicious Hitchcockian thriller takes us inside the mansion of Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore) and her two sons. The old lady's in failing health but she's not too sick to worry for her young chambermaid, Helen (Dorothy McGuire). She's a mute who just may be the next target of a serial killer stalking their New England town, a monster that likes to murder women with imperfections.Madame's insistence that Dr. Parry (Kent Smith) take Helen with him is a clue perhaps to just who the strangler is.It's a well-mounted picture that has sets crammed with Victorian-era furnishings, creating a sort of claustrophobic home undoubtedly typical of the well-off of those days.Miss McGuire is the stand-out of this exceptional cast, but right behind her are Elsa Lanchester's humorously alcoholic cook and Rhonda Fleming as a live-in secretary who's the love interest of both Warren sons: the Professor (George Brent, just past his leading man days) and Steve (Gordon Oliver).A final word for Sara Allgood, who has the unenviable task of being the bearish old woman's put-upon nurse. They clearly despise each other, and it's only a matter of time before a neglected Nurse Barker resigns and leaves in a huff (NOT a Huffmobile!).Robert Siodmak's classic suspense yarn gets my highest endorsement!",5,The silent scream,1265760000,"02 10, 2010",0.171

7,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,764007440,Bobby Underwood,"[5, 5]","This fondly remembered film uses a gothic atmosphere and a terrific performance from Dorothy McGuire to capture and keep the viewer's attention. The suspense builds slowly and it is the kind of film best watched on a rainy night with a big bowl of popcorn.Nicholas Musuraca's photography captures the menace of the wind and rain in this truly old-fashioned tale of suspense and romance. Dorothy McGuire shines as the mute Helen under Robert Siodmak's uncluttered direction. Roy Webb, famous for many great scores at RKO, adds another fine one to his list in this Dore Schary production from Selznick. This is a film of atmosphere and performance rather than nail-biting tension. As with many of Ethel Lina White's novels brought to film, the movie is actually better than the book.The film opens as the mute Helen appropriately watches a silent film while a killer on the loose preys once more on a young woman with an imperfection. Helen is very aware of her own limitations but the young town doctor is in love with her and believes she can be helped to speak once again. When it becomes evident that the killer is connected somehow to the old mansion where Helen takes care of the ill Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore), she is soon in great danger because of her affliction.From there it is only a matter of figuring out just who Helen should be wary of. An old spiral staircase and a single rainy night will reveal much. The two very different sons of Mrs. Warren offer latent hostility and intrigue while Dr. Parry tries to protect and warn her, as does the sick Mrs. Warren. Rhonda Fleming offers a sexy contrast to McGuires's wholesome mute girl as the secretary romancing the wayward brother Steven. A fine cast that includes Kent Smith as the doctor, George Brent as the responsible son, and Elsa Lanchester round out the players in this gothic style drama.A shy kiss between Helen and Dr. Parry in a doorway sets the tone for the film, which is very old-fashioned suspense and romance. McGuire has some wonderful moments throughout the film. One such is when she is daydreaming of her marriage to Dr. Parry which becomes a nightmare beacause she cannot utter I do at the alter. The pace is slow and deliberate but works because of a wonderful ending, especially the final shot.Those expecting grandiose tension and suspense will probably be disappointed upon seeing this film for the first time. Those who can ignore all the hype of its reputation, however, will find much to love in its gothic atmosphere and old-fashioned romance.

8,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,764007440,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","Dorothy McGuire delivers an amazing performance as a traumatised mute in this expertly-directed classic of the thriller genre. THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE (based on the book Some Must Watch by Ethel Lina White) is a moodily-lit, delicious treat for the true lovers of screen thrillers.In a picture-perfect New England town, someone is murdering young women who have physical afflictions. Could Helen (Dorothy McGuire) be next? Following an horrific event in her past, Helen has lived her life as a mute. Employed as companion to the bedridden Mrs Warren (Ethel Barrymore), Helen is told that her life is in danger and she must leave the house immediately. Is the killer closer than she thinks....and when the killer makes their presence known, will Helen find the courage to scream? THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE is a complete thrill-ride, from it's prologue set in a turn-of-the-century movie theater, to the emotionally-devastating conclusion.Dorothy McGuire holds the whole movie together, with her masterly performance as mute Helen. It's much subtler than a silent movie or dumb show performance, nor is it melodramatic; the amount of emotion McGuire is able to convey with the simplest look, and the way her eyes tell you what's inside her head, is incredible. It's a total tour-de-force from an actress who was never really given her full dues in Hollywood.Ethel Barrymore, George Brent and Rhonda Fleming lead the outstanding supporting cast, with Elsa Lanchester as the drunken maid, and Sara Allgood as Mrs Warren's comical nurse.The art direction and cinematography in THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE are all showcased to their best advantage with this new DVD release. There's some minor print damage and water-marking in some areas but on the whole it's a very pleasing transfer for a movie made in 1946.

9,A8EJY5GPQV2BW,764007440,Carl Tait,"[10, 11]","The plotting and script of &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; are reasonably good but unexceptional. The &quot;surprise&quot; ending isn't very startling even by 1940s standards -- try &quot;Laura&quot; (1944) for a much more inventive mystery plot.All of this is beside the point, however. As a thriller, this film is justly beloved for one critical factor: ATMOSPHERE. No special effects, no buckets of blood, no sexual escapades interrupted by serial killers, but a truly unnerving (and beautifully effective) sense of gloom and uneasy fear. Robert Siodmak was one of the greatest directors of film noir, and virtually every movie he made is shot through with his wonderful brand of darkly-shadowed artistry.It is sad to report that this is Siodmak's only film noir available on DVD. At least &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946; his &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;) is on VHS -- along with &quot;Phantom Lady&quot; and a few other goodies -- but some of Siodmak's classic films are not commercially available in any form.

13,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,764007440,C. O. DeRiemer,"[8, 8]","A forbidding mansion far from town, a night of driving rain and thunder, a mute young woman who works for the ill matriarch, a spiral staircase that goes down to the shadowy basement...and a killer who strangles women who are imperfect.The Spiral Staircase may not be full of frights, but it is an eerie exploration of suspense. The mansion itself is a great prop. Lit by candles and gas light, the rooms, covered with flocked wallpaper, are filled with flickering shadows, deep velvet curtains, carved marble fireplaces and dark oaken tables. Helen Capel (Dorothy McGuire), who became mute when she was a child, works there as a maid. She helps care for Mrs. Warren (Ethel Barrymore), the bedridden, ill and strong-willed matron of the house. Mrs. Warren has a son, Steve Warren (Gordon Oliver), an unreliable ne'er-do-well, and a stepson, Professor Albert Warren (George Brent). She has no illusions. They are both weaklings, she says.In the village, young women are being strangled...one had a limp, another was simple minded, one had a scar on her face. It's not long before we realize Helen is on the killer's list, and that the killer is most likely someone who lives in the Warren mansion. One person who seems drawn to Helen is Dr. Parry (Kent Smith), the new physician in the village. He is convinced that Helen can be made to speak and wants to take her to Boston for treatment. Mrs. Warren, although bedridden and often irascible, is no fool about the murders. When Helen is late coming home in the evening from the village, Mrs. Warren tells her, Come here. I'd hoped you were never coming back. You should run away. Leave this house tonight if you know what's good for you! During the long night, however, the killer shows his determination to make Helen his next victim.It's not too hard to figure out who the killer most likely is. Since Dorothy McGuire is the star of the movie, it's also unlikely that her character will be killed. What makes this movie work so well, in my opinion, are several elements. First, not whether Helen will be killed, but what dangers will Helen face unable to call for help, including a final confrontation with the killer? Second, who among the supporting cast will be killed? There is the professor's secretary, Blanche (Rhonda Fleming), the cook (Elsa Lanchester), her husband (Rhys Williams) and the nurse (Sara Algood). It's unlikely all will live. Third, the production values of the movie. The Spiral Staircase is beautifully staged and filmed, with each shot framed for maximum creepy effect. The descent to the basement, where one killing takes place and another is attempted, is almost worth the price of the DVD itself. The place is deeply shadowed with wooden trusses and brick walls, piles of cut wood and an axe, heavy casks and rows of cobwebbed wine bottles...so many places to hide, and the only light coming from candles so easy to blow out. Fourth, the killings are subtly handled, which makes them all the more unsettling. The murderer is never shown until the end. Before then we only see his eyes. We never see the actual killings, either, only black shadow and white hands clutching at the air. And fifth, the performances of Dorothy McGuire and Ethel Barrymore. McGuire, in my view, was a fine actress with an innate quality of goodness about her. We worry about Helen because of McGuire's skill and personality. Barrymore was a dominant actress in all her roles. Here, bedridden, she must act with her eyes and her face. She becomes an implacable old woman who sees that justice is done.The Anchor Bay DVD has an excellent picture and audio.

14,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,764007440,cookieman108 cookieman108,"[12, 12]","I did some checking and I discovered this film, The Spiral Staircase, originally released in 1946, has been remade a few times over the years...once in 1961 with Eddie Albert, Hayley Mills, Elizabeth Montgomery, and Gig Young (a made for TV feature), again in 1975 with Jacqueline Bisset, Christopher Plummer, and John Phillip Law (a full length feature this time), and then yet again in 2000 with Nicollette Sheridan and Judd Nelson (this last one, also a made for TV feature, sounds like a real winner). Adapted from the novel Some Must Watch by Ethel Lina White, and directed Robert Siodmak (The Killers, Criss Cross, The Crimson Pirate), the film stars the demure, beautiful, and extremely talented Dorothy McGuire (Three Coins in the Fountain, Old Yeller, Swiss Family Robinson). Also appearing is George Brent (The Corpse Came C.O.D., FBI Girl), Kent Smith (Cat People, The Curse of the Cat People), Rhonda Fleming (A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court), Gordon Oliver (Jezebel), Elsa Lanchester (Bride of Frankenstein, Murder by Death), Sara Allgood (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), Rhys Williams (How Green Was My Valley), James Bell (I Walked with a Zombie), and Ethel Barrymore, who won an Oscar in her previous, supporting role in the Cary Grant film None But the Lonely Heart (1944).The film, set at the turn of the century, begins with the murder of a woman at a hotel, one where a crowd of people just happen to be in attendance of an old timey picture show (the kind where a pianist plays the accompanying score), including Helen (McGuire), a mute woman who works as a servant for a local well to do family. Around this time we learn the murder is not an isolated incident, as someone is stalking women with physical infirmities and doing way with them (the woman in the hotel had a severe limp). Dr. Parry (Smith), who has a keen interest in Helen and her condition, makes the scene and offers her a ride home, but halfway there he's called away so Helen must walk the rest of the way, and it seems, along with the darkness (and a menacing figure lurking about), a storm is coming (in more ways than one). Once Helen arrives at her place of employment, a very large manor owned by a family named Warren, we meet a whole slew of interesting characters. There's Professor Warren (Brent), his secretary Blanche (Fleming), the Professor's playboy half brother Stephen (Oliver) who's just returned from a long European trip, their bedridden mother Mrs. Warren (Barrymore), Mrs. Oates (Lanchester), the cook, her husband (Williams), and finally Nurse Barker (Allgood). As the storm outside continues to build, so does the ominous sense of danger, due in part to Mrs. Warren's continual insistences Helen leave the house as soon as possible, as she seems to have serious doubts about Helen's safety (one couldn't blame her given her sons, one a smarmy mouth ne'er-do-well, the other a bookish fop). There's safety in numbers, but as various members of the household are called away for whatever reason, Helen soon discovers she probably should have listened to Mrs. Warren and got while the gettin' was good...I enjoyed this film a lot, especially in terms of the huge, slightly creepy manor which most of the story took place. The distinctive shadows, darkened corridors, elaborate sets pieces, combined with masterful directing, featuring some strong and off putting killer point of view shots, and spooky musical scoring, all went a long way towards creating an overall eerie atmosphere, a continual sense of evil present as right from the beginning...that and the fact we knew from early on the killer followed Helen home and gained entry into the house. The characters are very distinctive, and played expertly by a highly professional cast, the real standouts being Dorothy McGuire, who has practically no speaking lines throughout the film and must rely solely on her expressionistic abilities, and also Ethel Barrymore as the infirmed, but certainly not mentally impaired Mrs. Warren, once a woman of great strength, now confined to her bed by afflictions brought on by advanced age (she was actually nominated for an Oscar in her role here). The one thing that really gave me the heebie jeebies as far as this film went was Ms. Barrymore as she would often seem to be feigning sleep, but then you'd look over at her and her eyes would be wide open, taking in everything that was going on...Bette Davis may have had peepers distinctive enough for Kim Carnes to pen a song about, but Ethel Barrymore certainly could have given her a run for the money (that and the fact the words Bette Davis comes across much better in a song than the words Ethel Barrymore). And talking about eyes, the killer was often displayed only in much abbreviated form, hands, a foot, etc., but usually by a close up of one wide, glaring eye full of murderous intent. As far as the identity of the killer, it was really anyone's game up until a certain point, and by then the writers wisely saw no point in keeping it a mystery anymore, as most everyone should have gotten clued in by then. I did pick up on it a little earlier than I expected, but only because of the not entirely subtle pushing of other characters as suspects drove me to my own conclusions. As to the motive behind the murders, that aspect did remain secret until it was revealed. I suppose one might be able to discern it before the reveal, but I think this is a much more difficult element to peel away from the story, even though the pieces were there, which is, in my opinion, a real credit towards those who originally wrote, and then adapted this intricate story to the screen. For me, the most harrowing sequences involved the latter ones where various characters ventured, armed only with a candle, down into the dark, drafty, spooky, cobwebbed basement, filled with niches and hidey holes. All in all this is a wonderfully crafted film, and while I haven't seen the various remakes, I have a pretty good feeling the original is probably still the best.The picture, presented in fullscreen, original aspect ratio (1.33:1), looks beautifully sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through extremely clear. The only extra featured on the DVD is a theatrical trailer for the Johnny Depp film Secret Window (2004), and odd inclusion, I thought, but whatever.Cookieman108",4,I'm never more witty than when I've had a little nip.,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",0.0385

So is stylish noir director Robert Siodmak who really knows how to translate troubled inner worlds into complex camera effects. Together, they transform the hoary elements of a maniacal killer, a spooky old mansion, and a houseful of suspects, into a memorable movie experience.I paricularly like the opening sequence where a 1900's audience sits watching an early feature length film, The Kiss. The rest of the audience sits stoically, not knowing what to make of the new-fangled experience. However, Mc Guire's simple servant girl sits enraptured, absolutely transfixed, her luminous eyes suffering along with the endangered heroine, whose predicament curiously foreshadows Mc Guire's own plight yet to come. I doubt that any actress has won over an audience any faster than during those few seconds.Credit should also go to that terrific RKO tandem of art director Albert D'Agostino and set director Darrel Silvera, whose artistic eye helped lift that studio into the pantheon of 1940's black & white. Together, they manage to keep a single set, the old house, from becoming boring to look at, while perfectly complementing Siodmak's own gothic sensibilities.Still, there is a downside. Poor Kent Smith plays the young doctor. Technically, he's a competent enough actor; however, his charisma factor registers somewhere between dull gray and dried cement. Here his rather smarmy physician appears to have wandered over from the set of Young Doctor Kildare. Fortunately, his screen time is limited.In compensation are the wonderfully daffy Elsa Lanchester as the cook, and Carleton the dog as Carleton the dog, perhaps the most beautifully ugly face in the history of canine thespians. Also, making an impressive appearance is an apparent forerunner of hurricane Katrina , howling and thundering for the entire ninety minutes in true gothic fashion.Anyhow, this is a genuinely artistic suspenser from RKO's golden period, proving once again why Hollywood's eventual stampede to technicolor was not an unmixed blessing.",5,Steer Clear of the Wine Cellar,1155513600,"08 14, 2006",0.1239

The Spiral Staircase is a solid little horror/suspense thriller that carefully crafts its settings, as well as a feeling of claustrophobic fear -- the only problem is that it's pretty obvious who the villain is.A small rural town is being plagued by a serial killer; he only preys on young women who are handicapped, either mentally or physically. I'll leave you to speculate on the Freudian subtext there.So unsurprisingly people are worried about Helen, a young mute woman (although for some reason, Helen doesn't seem concerned much). Helen lives in an old gothic mansion some miles from town, working as the companion to an elderly, crabby lady who keeps uttering vague warnings of death'n'doom. Also present: an exasperated nurse, the cook and her hubby, and the old lady's son and stepson.So when a thunderstorm hits and the old woman has an attack of... whatever she's suffering from, Helen's doctor boyfriend goes rushing off to get ether. However, someone is watching Helen from inside the house, and this person is determined to kill her before the night is out...As a mystery, The Spiral Staircase is pretty flawed. Helen spends the entire movie ignoring warnings of death'n'doom from... pretty much everybody, then is apparently shocked when the serial killer goes after her. Also: it's kind of obvious from the start who the murderer is, if nothing else because all the red herrings point so strongly to the only other suspect. It would have been nice if they had made us wonder about the other characters.But as a psychological thriller, this is a solid piece of work. Robert Siodmak fills the entire movie with a haunted, claustrophobic atmosphere, with huge shadows and dark stairwells. And he creates some wonderfully creepy moments as well -- the scene where the murderer sees Helen as a mouthless woman is pretty spine-chilling.And Dorothy McGuire is another reason to overlook the movie's shortcomings. She does an excellent job playing a naive, often terrified young girl, but doesn't go over the top with the physical acting. She reminded me a lot of Audrey Hepburn in Wait Until Dark, especially in the subtlety of her expressions and motions.The Spiral Staircase is flawed as a mystery, but quite spooky as an old-fashioned thriller.

Taking place mostly within the confines of an old house, it is a mystery that builds as we get closer to unmasking the killer. It's the sort of film that you might watch on a cold winter's evening beside the fireplace. Dorothy McGuire does an exceptional job as lead, playing Helen, a mute servant girl who is danger from a deranged killer who preys on women who have some type of physical handicap.The film opens with a shocking murder of a woman at the movies. The murder, it seems, is the third one in recent days, with each murder having involved women with some type of physical abnormality. Helen, who happened to have gone to the movies on her day off, is told to get home soon before it gets dark. Later, after the constable gives word that the killer is loose and in the vicinity, it becomes clear that Helen may be a target and in imminent danger. Suspicion arises within the household as to who the murderer, and next victim, may be.Particularly effective is how the narrative is shown to the viewer. The story alternates from a neutral perspective to a perspective from the killer's point of view. The way this is done is reminiscent of some slasher and horror films of the modern era, and this really intensifies and enhances the tension as we get closer to seeing how things will turn out. The film builds to a dramatic, suspenseful conclusion.This film has everything that a suspense set in Gothic tradition should have: shadowy figures, darkness, dramatic tension, creepy music score, a likeable heroine, a murderer lurking around within, ominous warnings from a sickly invalid, slight romantic interests, and a variety of suspects and victims.

It was adapted from the book &quot;Some Must Watch&quot; by the prolific Ethel Lina White. 2 of White's books had been made into films by Alfred Hitchcock. &quot;The Wheel Spins&quot; became &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, and &quot;Before the Fact&quot; became &quot;Suspicion&quot;. &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot; deals with a pretty creepy premise: An unknown killer has been murdering women with &quot;afflictions&quot;. (One victim was disfigured, another feeble-minded, another lame). Helen, a young mute servant girl working in a gloomy old mansion, is the killer's next intended victim. The killer is in the house with her, but who is it? Siodmak, a master of film noir, holds your attention for approximately 85 minutes, and never lets go. All of the classic elements are here: Old gloomy house, thunderstorm, chiaroscuro lighting, eerie musical score, colorful performances. The sets, by the way, are leftovers from Orson Welles' &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;, the music score by Roy Webb, who had composed other goose-pimplers such as &quot;The Cat People&quot;, &quot;I Walked With a Zombie&quot;, &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; and Hitchcock's &quot;Notorious&quot;. Dr. Samuel J. Hoffman on the Theremin is featured on this score, providing added goosebumps. And the cast! Pretty Dorothy McGuire is excellent as the endangered Helen, in a house peopled by the likes of the very grand Ethel Barrymore, the wooden George Brent, marvelous character actors Elsa Lanchester, Rhys Williams and Sara Allgood, handsome Kent Smith and Gordon Oliver, and lovely Rhonda Fleming. Ellen Corby is in the film too, in a bit part-watch for her! Robert Siodmak was an excellent &quot;B&quot; movie director, having made masterpieces on relatively small budgets.

So, in this age of over-inflated budgets, it's a wonder and honor to see these well-made films from an era of almost non-existent special effects, modest budgets, and great actors. The picture and sound quality on this DVD are excellent-very clean and crisp, so you can really appreciate the gloomy Victorian sets and eerie musical score.

The movie is in many respects a precursor to modern serial killer/stalker movies and used scare tactics that still remain in use more than 50 years later. The focus of the film is on a household at the turn of the century where a cranky old grandmother is bedridden and waiting to die, being looked after by a mute nurse who is the serial killers obvious next target as he clearly goes after victims with afflictions in his attempt to restore perfection and beauty to a tainted world. The director manages to conjure up an effective feeling of dread and claustrophobia - this is a long, long way from William Castle's amiable ghost frolic The House on Haunted Hill which played more like a farce than a thriller. The film is a little reminiscent of another classic serial killer outing made much later in England, Peeping Tom and was clearly way ahead of its time when it came out in 1946. The cast headed by Dorothy McGuire and George Brent but watch out especially for one of the screen's immortal icons, Elsa Lanchester who will forever be remembered as The Bride of Frankenstein.

What did make The Spiral Staircase rather innovative was the use of a mute servant girl, played by Dorothy McGuire, as one of the murderer's intended victims. It's this element that provides the film a larger measure of suspense, and creates a mood of vulnerability comparable to some of the best horror films of the day.There's the strong influence of Val Lewton's fright-films of the early 40s, signaled by the presence of Kent Smith and James Bell --- leftovers from the Lewton troupe who had appeared, respectively, in The Cat People and I Walked With a Zombie. In fact, Lewton's use of Bell in The Leopard Man clearly figured in Robert Siodmak's direction for The Spiral Staircase, except that in this film, Bell becomes a police inspector, and the red herring role goes to (well, no need to spoil it for newcomers...).Merely recounting the influences on this film, though, gives no indication of its real magic, which lies in the way Siodmak brings everything together into a sort of Gothic gestalt. And we might see McGuire's performance as sort of a visual obverse to that of Claude Rains in The Invisible Man: whereas Rains did almost everything by conveying omnipotence with his voice, McGuire steals the show by conjuring helplessness through pantomime and facial expressions.Thankfully, we now have The Spiral Staircase in what is probably the best print seen in decades. In fact, Anchor Bay really deserves accolades for this excellent DVD, which gives us this film in a beautifully-preserved edition. True, the disc is short on bonus features (it's just the film and the trailer), but otherwise this is a fine addition to any suspense fan's film library.",5,A Great Suspenser,969235200,"09 18, 2000",0.2037

She could not communicate, she could not plead or call for help...It was New England in 1906, and she was employed by the bedridden mistress (Ethel Barrymore) of an old mansion (decorated in Victorian style). On the girl's day off, a disabled girl was found murdered in the little town. It was the third such murder...

No need to go into the grim details, but if you want style, thrills and chills, see the 1946 version with George Brent, Dorothy McGuire and Ethel Barrymore and ignore the dreadful attempt to update a classic that needed no updating.This is the one that set the template for all horror movies that followed; the original from which all others flowed. The spooky music, which, in it's time, was as groundbreaking as the theme from Jaws. The classic 3 notes sent chills down my spine, and when I first saw this movie I was 7 years old and it really did scare the hell out of me. I watched it with my father and he loved it too; we had a Million Dollar Movie that played 5 nights for one week and we watched it every night.Ethel Barrymore is, as always, superb and lends the perfect touch to this spooky, suspenseful movie. George Brent is wonderful as the smooth soft-spoken professor, the head of the house, and the caretaker of the family. Dorothy McGuire conveys tremendous emotion given her muted state; she has, throughout most of the movie, not one word of dialogue but a world of emotions and you can tell what she's thinking and feeling.The setting is a New England town, circa 1890, and the house is a huge Victorian, very luxurious and beautifully furnished. The opening scene shows a group of people in a room in a hotel breathlessly watching The Kiss, which was groundbreaking in it's time, because it showed the first kiss ever put on film and was quite shocking back then. The music for The Kiss consists of a woman playing the piano according to whatever mood is onscreen, and is perfect for the score for SS also.There is a serial killer on the loose; preying on women with handicaps/afflictions, which puts Dorothy McGuire, as Helen, in a very precarious situation and it is her safety we are concerned with. The house is populated with a disparate group, and one by one each is somehow removed in varying circumstances, leaving Helen vulnerable to an attack. To enhance the mood, there is a violent thunderstorm throughout the movie, and the lightning flashes occasionally reveal hidden dangers outside and inside (!) the house.So, for an appreciation of truly excellent moviemaking, (and thrills and chills)see this gem, it is as scary today as it was in it's film debut back in 1946...",5,THE ORIGINAL-AND ONLY-SPIRAL STAIRCASE; THIS IS ONE CLASSIC,1129248000,"10 14, 2005",0.1136

In this 84 minute, black and white classic film noir, beautiful young Helen Capel, who became mute as a result of childhood trauma, has lived most of her life in silence. Still, she's made peace with her disability, and lives as a servant to, in the house of wealthy, old, ailing Mrs. Warren. Until the young woman realizes she is being stalked by a serial killer who preys on physically impaired women. Suddenly, the servant must find a way to let others know she's in danger, but how? The night is dark and dangerous, there is a thunderstorm outside. Mrs. Warren orders Capel to leave the house immediately, implores Dr. Parry to take her. He agrees, but another sick patient comes up. This mystery/thriller was produced by Dore Schary, ably directed by Robert Siodmak. Screenplay was by Mel Dinelli, based on a novel, SOME MUST WATCH, by Ethel Lina White.The woman-in-danger film is surprisingly well-cast for what today would be considered a genre film, with good principal and supporting actors who turn in strong performances. Dorothy McGuire, (GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT), plays Helen. Ethel Barrymore, (PORTRAIT OF JENNIE, PINKY) in an Oscar-nominated performance, plays Mrs. Warren. Mrs. Warren's sons, Albert, a professor, played by George Brent, (DARK VICTORY, JEZEBEL), and Steve, a flippant, womanizing layabout, played by Gordon Oliver, also live in. Kent Smith plays handsome young Dr. Parry. The beautiful young Rhonda Fleming, (SPELLBOUND, OUT OF THE PAST), plays Blanche, Albert's secretary, who's been leading rather a busy love life. Elsa Lanchester, (BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, BELL BOOK AND CANDLE), plays Mrs. Oates, the establishment's cook/housekeeper. Rhys Williams, (HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY), is Mr. Oates, her husband, the household's chauffeur, man of all work. Sarah Allgood plays Nurse Barker, nurse to Mrs. Warren; James Bell is the Constable. Still, it must be said that the huge eerie old house, full of dusty, mysterious nooks and crannies, with spider webs and spiral staircases galore, is the star of the production.
