The action is still superb and well-polished even since its release 10 years ago. The enemies are still smart, even with competitors like F.E.A.R. which have incredibly intelligent artificial intellignce. There are a couple of issues unfortunately; some targeting problems and odd save layouts. Other than those, this game is still one of the best shooters ever made. The missions are excellent, the enemies are cool, the weapons are cool, and virtually everything else about this game is superb and well-executed.

Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game, Perfect Dark (if you haven't had a chance to play that) is the superior shooter.They both are fun in their own right though. They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N64 gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also.Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too. Like I said, I liked the characters, Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game.Even the single-player mode was fun.

4,A2N1C9JKI2C5XD,B00000DMAT,An amazon visitor,"[0, 0]","I have to be honest: Normally, I'm not into these first person shooter games. They're just so clunky, most of the time you can't tell where you're going, you don't know if an enemy is behind you, (Or at times even in front of you, if you get a weird camera angle) and plus might I add that you can't see your character, which does not really, (For me, most of the time) give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character.Well, Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game.I don't know why people complain about the graphics...it's actually kind of cool, and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think they're real. The scientists in the facility level are well detailed, and most all the characters are animated incredibly.Besides, you take on the role of James Bond. James Bond! The hero that defined action! This game is not dull, and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room.The multiplayer mode, is, of course, wonderful. You can choose from power weapons, sniper rifels, Dostovals, Shotguns, PP7's, proximity mines, hand grenades, laser guns, and basicly everything else that you can think of. It is an entertaining game, and it is well worth the money.The camera angles rock. you never get lost.So, why didn't I give this game Five stars? Read below and find out.THE BADS OF THE GAMEThere are some major glitches. You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place. The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that? So, I stand back, the enemy comes in, and oh, guess what, it turns out that there isn't just one of them, there's thirty, so they all shoot at me, and I die. You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again. You don't just do the thing you forgot, either, you have to do all the things that you did do, as well as the things you did not.The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.The puzzles can be frustrating. I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.The game is also very gory. I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.Now, for the GOODS of this game.GOODSUse an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.It follows the movie really well, (Most of the time, anyways) And if you're a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game. Even if you aren't you'll still enjoy it.You play the role of james Bond, which is worth it within itself.This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N64. The controls aren't so difficult that you'll get lost and forget which buttons to use while you're losing, but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun. And even if you don't like the controls, you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen.There's nothing that you can't shoot or destroy.The cheats are FUNNY! I mean, honestly, try the invisibility mode. You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near, and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that. This makes the game easier also, and the invincibility mode is good too, although I tried and realized that you can't have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time. You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff, which is really funny to see.The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the movie...they look exactly like the actors.At the end of every level, it tells you how many kills you did, how many limb shots, how many head shots, and how many body shots you had.The artificial intelligence with the badguys aren't all that challenging, but when there's a whole crowd of them, watch out!This game is excellent. Did I mention that it's excellent? Let me repeat it again: This game is excellent! Excellent I tell you, excellent!",4,An excellent first person shooter game.,1027814400,"07 28, 2002",0.1884

6,A1AR8HYZ17T5H7,B00000DMAT,arxane,"[0, 0]","With the Nintendo 64 beginning to slowly...okay, quickly drop off the gaming radar, it's time for gamers who bought the last of the Big N's cartridge systems to see if their investment was a good one. Is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore? Is there one game to give you an excuse to say to Playstation2 and X-Box and Gamecube owners, I know it's an old system, but this game is the reason I still own it? Yes, and that game is called Golden Eye 007.It's hard to believe that a game based off the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies would become an undeniable classic. But that's exactly what Golden Eye is. Many first-person shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay, while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players. Thankfully, Golden Eye is the diamond in the rough. It takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination. Moving Bond, James Bond is as easy as breathing, and the shooting system is just as simple. Even with the horrible N64 controller, a player can learn how to play Golden Eye on the first or second try. And its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate AI. Of course, because of the N64's difficult-to-program cartridge format, some things had to be sacrificed, like detailed textures and realistic AI responses to being shot. But the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters.Graphically, Golden Eye 007 was a marvel to look at...when it was first released. Nowadays, when compared to games like Metal Gear Solid 2 for the PS2 and Dead or Alive 3 for the X-Box, Golden Eye looks like a SNES game. Because cartridges are limited in space, textures can be bland, character models look blocky, and detail is kept to a passable minimum. But anyone who doesn't care about graphics, as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent, shouldn't have any trouble with Golden Eye.Soundwise, it's not the biggest strength of the game, but it's still good. Sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done - a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it, at least to a certain extent. And voices, while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs, suit the game well. It would've been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters, but the limitations of the cartridge format doesn't help this area much.All in all, Golden Eye is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming. While the N64 is arguably one of the worst Nintendo consoles to be released (alongside the horrendous Virtua Boy), it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the Gamecube was announced. Golden Eye is not only the game that many FPS fans point to as their favorite game, but many non-FPS gamers also found it very enjoyable. While later great first-person shooters like the N64's Perfect Dark and the recent X-Box million-seller Halo presented excellet FPS action with updated graphics to boot, Golden Eye will forever be remembered as the first-person shoot for the masses.If you need a reason to keep your N64, this is it!",5,One of the defining first-person shooters in existence!,1018396800,"04 10, 2002",0.2191

The music is good. It has a mysterious sound to it for some reason. This game has some of the best levels in any game, and it controls great. Multiplayer in this game is some of the most addictive ever. At the time it had the best multiplayer around.

8,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00000DMAT,Ben Rowland,"[0, 0]","Goldeneye 007, at first glance, looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated First-Person shooter game genre. The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation.In a word, Goldeneye is amazing. It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth, fun, and challenging adventure. You assume the role of James Bond, the secret agent who needs no introduction. You run through various missions, which tie into the movie, and solve various problems and perform various tasks. What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight. As expected, you have a number of weapons at your disposal, from the silenced pistol and machine gun, to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives. The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game, with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond's charm.The graphics are phenominal, with smooth movements and amazing scenery. This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures. The music is right out of a Bond movie, and adds a nice edge to the action. The controls, usually quite clunky on that horrible N64 controller, are easy to manage here. After a while it becomes like second nature.For parents considering this game for their children, they should be aware of the violence. Much of the game is spent killing people, and the realism is striking.

The graphics are honestly really bad and the controls make you feel like you're drunk. I guess that's where the fun is though, because honestly I really did like the game. I played through it and although the gameplay schematics were a bit...strange, it was oddly addicting. Multiplayer is a lot of fun though when you have friends sitting down in the basement all hooked up. It can get pretty intense on split screen, seriously. 5 stars for the split screen! 4 stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit.

11,A36UKFV79879MD,B00000DMAT,BX Lounger,"[5, 5]","In the year 1997, Goldeneye was released for the Nintendo 64 by Rare, an unknown company and new 2nd party developer. Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo 64 market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title. You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo 64 if they ever played this game and why it was so popular. You're guaranteed to hear 2 reasons in particular why this game is so revered.REASON #1: This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game. It was more than 2 years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music, likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday. They didn't rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake. This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers.REASON #2: Nintendo had no idea that the multi-player section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode. Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multi-player mode until later in its development stages. Though it may be limited by today's standards, you had the basics: several stages based on the single player mode, all of the weapons were available, all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match, team death match, you only live twice (2 lives) etc. and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match. This added a lot of re-playability after you finished the single player mode.If you don't have a Nintendo 64, this game is reason enough to get it. This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it. It's a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with 3 of your friends. Peace. :)",5,This is how all movie based video games should be made,1282608000,"08 24, 2010",0.2144

I was stupid enough to trade in my Goldeneye copy for a nwer but NOT better game. Don't make the same mistake that I did, please! It is hard to get your hands on a good copy of Goldeneye these days. Protect your Goldeneye games! This game lives up perfectly to the movie, and for a 1997 game, the graphics and sound are excellent! Sure, Nightfire's fun, but it never revolutionized the gaming world like Goldeneye did. Goldeneye shoots TWINE and Agent Under Fire out of the sky. Nightfire can't even hold its ground against this solid and superb N64 title. In Goldeneye, you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the Goldeneye film, and the single player campaign holds its ground. But multiplayer is where the game really shines, and it is so much better than Timesplitters or Timesplitters 2 even. I have not played Goldeneye for over a year, but the music rings in my head and I have the levels memorized perfectly. Even if you worship your Perfect Dark copy, I believe that Goldeneye is better, and I have a strong debate on that. The bottom line is that Goldeneye is the BEST FPS EVER CREATED!! It boils down to this:if you own an N64, please play your Goldeneye copy or if you don't even know what this wonderful game is about, buy it now!

Morelock Team Trioxin,"[2, 2]","I have fond memories of this game, and still get together to play it with friends.Before GoldenEye, first person shooters were primarily PC affairs, played with a keyboard and mouse, and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities, which, at the time, I didn't have. GoldenEye changed this. Just like Mario Kart, you could get four players hooked in. Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track, you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond, or one of his allies/antagonists. There are plenty of modes, arenas, and weapons to choose from, ranging from deathmatch to 'flag tag'. And once in a while you have to play with slappers only.In addition to the Multiplayer aspects, it has an excellent Single-Player mode. It's mission objective based (meaning that failure is entirely possible), and as difficulty increases, so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill.The music is also notable. Sure it's entirely synhtesized/MIDI, but in those days, that was the state of the art. The music fits the scenes pretty well, mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme, some being a little different.The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock ( by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives).Whether you've never played this classic or you're looking back on the 'good old days', you should play it.

Forget a touchdown, this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards, with three interceptions and a dozen field goals. Nothing on a home console was even close to its league. And even today, in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo, Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters, the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations.It's difficult to call any game perfect. No matter how original, how exciting, how breathtaking it may look, sound, play or feel, there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas, and Goldeneye is no exception. Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers. No lie, I've memorized the layout of a base from start to finish, known there's nowhere these soldiers could be coming from, and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers' attack. It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits' end. In addition, there's the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way. Every once in a while, an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand, blankly staring, for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the other soldiers' bullets couldn't pass right through him. So you'll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man, a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him, all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body. Despite my small misgivings however, 99% of this game plays flawlessly. The progression of difficulty is astounding, moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the cart's conclusion. And it's all done while walking that razor's edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving. The player realises these missions are possible, even as he's watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes.Add to all that three difficulty levels, cheats that must be unlocked with speed, precision and overall know-how, hidden stages and hidden characters. Not only do you have a legendary FPS, you've also found nearly limitless replay value. Goldeneye is more than just a very good game, it's the stuff legends are made of. It's a game you'll want to play with your grandkids years from now.Hands down, the most attractive part about Bond's N64 debut, even today, is its controls. The Nintendo 64 controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with 007's repertoire, as every button is in precisely the right place for its function. It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. The center grip of the N64 controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP7, Bond's revolver of choice. The Z button is a perfect trigger, and if you've purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire. Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand, as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle. No control system has ever felt so immersive, so right. After the first level, you hardly recognize the controller is there, it's already become such an extension of your own body. I can't sing any higher a praise than that.If you've seen the feature film of the same name, you'll notice some eerie similarities. Everything, from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen. It's honestly unsettling, how well the level designers did their jobs. Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film? You'll get your chance to find the answer on the N64. It's an experience I can't really put into words, something I'd never seen before and haven't seen since. It's a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption.Finally, there's the multiplayer aspect of 007. While the single-player mode is challenging, unique and groundbreaking, multiplayer is absolutely unreal. I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released, and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than I'd wish on anyone. There were literally lines leading into my room, just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action. It was an addictive community event, whenever that little red light on the front of our N64 lit up. Truly something special. With multiple modes of play, a handful of playable levels, some hidden surprises and dozens of options, you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice, and it didn't take much for the lighthearted action to become a cold-hearted war. In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a no-brainer, it's hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field. Goldeneye blazed that path, and did so in style. It cleared out the weeds, flattened the hills, and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today. Truly, the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such.In short, Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo 64, even today. There's a charm about it that can't be described, a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay. It's got the look and feel of a legend, and that's exactly the word I'd use to describe it. While there are certainly flaws, this is a game you'll kick yourself for never owning in a few years, when it becomes increasingly difficult to track down.",5,Buried Gold on the N64,1041292800,"12 31, 2002",0.0768

Where else could you blow up 3 of your friends with a bazooka at the same time (if you were lucky enough to stumble upon them shooting it out with each other).GoldenEye has never left my 64 rotation and again, I still love to play the multi player when my friends come over.

Where you think 006 Alec Treyvelyn was kill & where Bond escapes in the plane. There is a level you saw in the movie Servenya that you go to. You have to go there twice the 2nd time is where you meet Natalya who in the movie you meet in the helicopter explosion. Of course you meet Janus at The Statue Park who turns out to be Treyvelyn. You get to use a tank just like in the movie you get to go through the train depot which isn't in the movie the train level is pretty good & there are lines that Alec Treyvelyn says in the movie on this level.

This game really pushed the capabilities of the Nintendo 64 with its 3D (if somewhat still pixelated) surroundings. There were enough options and variety to make the game interesting - you could go through the levels in Easy, Normal, and Hard mode, and beating the levels in certain difficulty levels within certain time limits would unlock cheats. Some of the cheats were silly, like Donkey Kong mode, but others were cooler, like Invisible or Infinite Ammo mode.Playing the levels in Easy mode was a great way to prep/'study' for Normal and Hard modes (exploring the surroundings, knowing where to go, so you could complete the extra requirements that came with the difficult mode) The save mode allowed one to explore the levels at their leisure - sometimes I played a level I already beat just for fun and exploration, ignoring the time. Molti-player mode was also a lot of fun.The graphics in this game were not as refined as the Wii and PS3 because Nintendo 64 was a groundbreaking console when it came out and the 3D graphics ability was not quite fully mastered yet, so for those of you used to the smoother graphics of today's current consoles, you might notice a bit of clunkiness, and the characters had blocky hands and limbs, and their faces looked painted on their heads. But the 3D was well-done in terms of set-up and surroundings as far as movement and exploration of the world went, so two thumbs up.

The one game where I discovered something new almost every time I played. It was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least 3 or 4 times a week. Somehow it just wouldn't die, no matter how hard we tried.At first, it just seemed so standard and bland. Playing muliplayer for the first time, I had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the Temple level. soon, somehow, something clicked, and me and my friends ended up playing it for about 4 hours straight. Towards the end of that introductory marathon Goldeneye session, we took our first stride out of the standard Deathmatch restriction- increasing my character's health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me. Thus we coined the &quot;God&quot; mode, and we played this variant to death in the coming months.It didn't end there. We had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches. We bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen, LAN-type mode, covering up other player's screens so we wouldn't know where the other players were. We playedthe Team mode constantly, refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship. Fed up with auto-aiming, we turned it off and further honed our skills. I began to be able to play the Complex level in my sleep. Proximity mines soon became an addiction. We pushed the game to its limits, learning that we could move the ammo boxes, shields, and guns around by shooting them, thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games. We began to use Gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that weren't intended for the final version, as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players. We discovered a code that turned one player invisible, and proceeded to do hunter-hunted scenarios over splitscreen.Basically, it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities. It was a revolution for first-person shooters, and so many have overlooked this fact. It was the first to have targeting of individual body parts, over 20 weapons to choose from, realistic glass, shooting out of lights, and bullet holes, and for its time fairly revolutionary AI.

Each difficulty higher, the more parts of the level you explore, and the more crazy scenarios you will experience, places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties.. Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing. It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker #1 with just a silenced pp7 without alerting anyone. Nothing is more satisfying than shooting 2 gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm. In some levels if you are feeling arrogant, you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo. There is so much about this game I could go on for days about how amazing this game is. No modern AAA FPS has surpassed Goldeneye on N64 campaign to this day. The remakes have been complete crap, despite the amazing COD engine.

Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark. The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage. This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be. The production of the game is basically weak, with the menu intro being pathetic, and the music repeating over and over and over on each board. The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running, but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission.Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated. I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for a couple days and never feeling into it. the quad split screen was a big nuisance. Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category, especially the funfactor.So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title.

I can do the levels in my head I've played them so many times. The graphics are dull now, but back in the day these visuals were top notch. The music involves some of the best techno I've ever heard. The game is also surprisingly difficult. I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels. The multiplayer is ahead of it's time with four player large arena style deathmatches. This game should be missed by no one, pick up a copy today and first hand see the best.Presentation- This game captures what it is to be James Bond. There are a great deal of weapons, cool menus, and music that still rocks to this day. All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic. 5/5Story- The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely, and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies. Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker. 5/5Graphics- This game looked amazing for it's day, now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked. 5/5/Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made. Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day. 5/5Lasting Appeal- I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me. I can play levels in my head, need I say more.

66,ADB8XCKNSDY5Z,B00000DMAT,theboombody,"[1, 2]","I had to use a Gameshark to get the extra levels on this game. It's tough. It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent.There are two features about this game that I really like. The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability. If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin. Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die.Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again. They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill.Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability. You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening.The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it. You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame). But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky. You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots. Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away.This game is pretty realistic. There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff. It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck. I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.",4,Difficult,1120953600,"07 10, 2005",0.1121

Berk,"[3, 3]","GoldenEye 007 is not only the best movie tie-in game of all time, but it is perhaps the most influential first-person shooter ever to hit the gaming-console market. If you aren't aware of the plot of this game that's not a problem, because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie, GoldenEye, which was released in 1995- two years prior to this game's release.This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come, and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives, and difficult challenges. The A.I. is smart (especially on higher difficulty settings) and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment, as well as difficulty to any gamer.The introduction of logical hit-points on your enemies is a great feature. Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a well-aimed shot to the head. It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in, sneak out, covertly taking out henchmen as you go, or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts. Because of this there are many ways to beat the game, and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks. AKA: You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levels...and if you don't have a strategy guide you'll have to find out those paths by yourself (which, I might add, is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away).This is one of those games that the more you play it the more you're able to value its contributions to the gaming industry. Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games. So if you have a Nintendo 64 go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye 007, because trust me, as a Bond fan, and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond, or just have an awesome, intense gaming experience.(Also make sure to look out for its sister game, Perfect Dark, which is also on the N64, following the same controls, and very similar weapon uses.)",5,"One of the best, most innovative shooters of all time; A Must Have!",1238371200,"03 30, 2009",0.4008
