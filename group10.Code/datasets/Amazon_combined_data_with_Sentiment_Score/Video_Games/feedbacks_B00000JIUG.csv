There's not a lot of cutscenes here to help tell the story. No fancy soundtrack. Very little voice acting, which is a shame considering the voice actor for Ghaleon did a wonderful job. There's nothing like an elaborate prologue or ending that you got out of Xenosaga. Instead, gamers will have to depend on lots of reading and playing to make the story unfold.Battles are quite challenging. Basically, you plan the moves for all of your characters and then turn control over to the battle system. There is also an option to have the battle system fight for you, but this mode is not recommended.This game's story is very mild and shallow compared to the other RPGs mentioned above. LSSS's strong points are definitely fighting and solving puzzles. The story is a lightweight.

2,AFPH2BZGNNJ79,B00000JIUG,C. Kim,"[1, 1]","Ok.. I'll be honest here. I read couple reviews and sensing that this game is 'bit' over-rated. (I sense people who wrote reviews frowning) I did finish this game and trust me, I had lot of expectation for this game. I haven't played the Sega CD version of it and actually blamed one of the reviewers from EGM, who gave 8.5 when rest of them gave 9 or higher. I thought this game deserves at least 9, I mean, look at the animation, the title animation is one of the most well-represented animated beginning ever, and the music was just amazing. I was constantly humming the tune because it was so, so, SO GOOD- couldn't help myself from humming it all the time. Not only that, Working Design did a fantastic/excellent job on putting in all the extra you are getting with this game, it's simply amazing- I'm left with no choice but to give credit for that. However, after I finish the game, I realized that I came to conclusion too soon, when I did play only beginning portion of the game, mesmerized with beautifully animated movie scene.I wasn't inspired or felt that heartache or anything like that..I mean, characters are adorable and the story is good enough to pull you in, however, it wasn't just strong enough-So when I read several reviews saying this is the best RPG for PS or anything like that, I just couldn't agree with what they were saying, of course, everyone has right to their own opinion, but in my humble opinion, I just didn't feel it. It seemed to me that I'm more attracted to the games with more stronger theme, like Xenogear, and Lunar falls into mild-themed game, which is, of course, enjoyable.I didn't buy the sequel, Eternal Blue, which comes with more extra and whole box for the game looks great, however, I wasn't inspired enough to purchase Eternal Blue because it wasn't just there to hook me, wasn't just there...Well, it's definitely your call.. so if the price is reasonable for you and plenty of time, then give it a try and see how it goes. It's nice to have this game if you are a collector, however, I wouldn't buy this game if you are picking this ONE RPG to enjoy in your busy life, because there are better RPGs out there for PSOne in my humble opinion.",4,Don't get your expectation TOO HIGH because of the beginning,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",0.3999
3,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,B00000JIUG,Cloud ...,"[0, 0]","Originally released on the Sega CD, the developers thought that there could be some enhancements. So it ended up here and although graphically it looks like it came from the Sega CD era, the other enhancements and not to mention the great story and characters is more than enough to get this. Just good luck finding it, since it was in such demand, Working Designs stopped making them and made it incredibly rare to find.The story starts off in the town of Burg where the hero, Alex, dreams of becoming like his hero, Dragonmaster Dyne, who died under mysterious circumstances. Then the hero searches for the White Dragon to become like his hero and from there, he ends up in a battle for the entire land of Lunar. It seems like a straightforward story with plot twists you'll probably see a mile away but the way that it's executed is so masterful.There's some much needed humor in the game involving some pop culture references, such as when a traveller tells Nall(a flying cat) how much licks does it take to get the the center of a Tootsie Pop when it was an owl in the commercial.The music isn't incredibly memorable but it adds life and great background to each location and event the music is featured. The voice acting is amazing some great voices. The one thing that feels odd to me is the voice of Alex, Ashley Angel, is a member of the boy-band O-Town. Although it isn't the most baddest thing in the world, it feels odd.Don't expect mind-blowing visuals. These look quite old but they don't retract from the gameplay. The anime scenes though are incredibly beautiful that range from simple character intros to big plot points. The animation seems so colorful and vibrant rather than looking a little too &quot;adult&quot;. Even has some CG elements like Luna's song on the boat or something further in the game I'm not spoiling for you.If you can find it or borrow off somebody, play this immediately and experience the world of Lunar.",5,"If it isn't considered a classic, it better be",1027382400,"07 23, 2002",0.472
4,A3CYIPLD9090ZK,B00000JIUG,David Baker,"[2, 3]","I'm one of the ten or so people who actually bought a Sega CD and, like many (if not all), I believe this was the best RPG for that otherwise disappointing system. Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete brings me back to the good ol' days of RPGs before the likes of Final Fantasy VII and VIII were called the best RPGs ever by newbie gamers who just don't know any better. The story was flawless and breathtaking then, and yet, somehow, it all seems better this time around. What makes Lunar Lunar though is the fact that Working Designs was behind it. They can translate even the lamest games and make them playable (I even bought Shining Wisdom for my Saturn just because of Working Designs!). The people at Working Designs are a bunch of comedians. There are so many jokes in this game it's unbelievable (second only to Final Fantasy IX in humor). The game has received an upgrade in every single way, most notably, the graphics. Yes, the graphics aren't an important part of any game, but it's nice to see that they got an uplift this time around. Back to the story though. Everything about the story is perfect, it's beautiful, it's touching, and it's one of the best in any game I have ever seen. I could go into more detail...but you should really play it for yourself. What surprised me about playing Lunar again was the length of the game. It's pretty long. While not as long as its sequel, it still offers days of fun like I had with the original version. The characters themselves are great. Typical of their RPG times? Yes, but great nonetheless. Especially Alex and Nall, who I just loved. The difficulty of the game is very applaudable as well. Not incredibly difficult, but it's not easy either, and that's just another reason why I love this game so much. The one thing that didn't stand the test of time was the battles. They're very straight-forward and basic, nothing to it at all. It's just tap...tap...tap. Boring indeed. Thankfully the random number of battles isn't frequent. The packaging also needs mention. Lunar:SSSC comes with a nice box that contains a 100+ page leatherette hardbound artbook/instruction manual, a making of Lunar CD, a music CD, and a full-color cloth map. Who loves ya? Working Designs! Unfortunately, new-school gamers might be put off by Lunar's old-school look and feel continuously asking &quot;Where's Bahamut Zero?&quot; This is unfortunate because it looks like Lunar might go back to the cult status it had on the Sega CD instead of selling by the truckloads like it deserves. Oh well...definitely their loss. Nevertheless, this is a masterpiece. Lunar:SSSC should be as mandatory as the controller for PSX owners. Truly one of the best RPGs of all time...hey, you know the drill: If you're a gamer, you owe it to yourself to buy this. Oh yes, don't forget to pick up the sequel as well.",5,A Classic Among Classics...,977270400,"12 20, 2000",0.3316
5,A1ZYZ5853ZADZA,B00000JIUG,Eric Johnson,"[12, 12]","If you are looking for story as the driving force behind an RPG, then this is a game you will enjoy. Lunar doesn't rely on graphics or amazing sound. It relies on the strength of its storyline. The graphics are the type you'd find on an older system, which makes sense because this game was originally released on the Sega-CD. This comes with two bonus CD's. One is a soundtrack, which is nothing to be excited about since the music isn't something you'd want to listen to outside of the game, but is a nice touch. The other is a making of CD that was rather interesting because you get to see how much the people who made this game were into it and cared about the finished product.One of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting. It's such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game. The female voices can seem rather whiny and too high pitched (which could be said of the males at times too), but other than that, it's quite good. Also, there is a lot of pop culture references and innuendo going on that make you laugh. That may be the best thing about the game. The story is fun. The game is fun. You have fun playing the game.It's not new. It's not full of eye candy. But the game is very enjoyable and worth the money if you enjoy playing with a good story.",4,Good Old-School RPG,979603200,"01 16, 2001",0.5168
6,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B00000JIUG,Feelah the tigress,"[1, 1]","I would say that Lunar is a worthy RPG and definitely still worth playing if you have an appreciation for the classics. However, it may not be worth paying the exorbitant used prices (the cheapest I found my copy was $60, then one of the discs was all scratched up and nonfunctioning, and I had to buy new discs for $30! Yikes!). Anyway, let's see if Lunar withstands the test of time.Graphics (score 8/10): Well, since this version of Lunar (the Playstation version) was enhanced from the original, it looks really good for an older RPG, especially when compared to the playstation ports of Final Fantasy V and VI. However, the graphics are still undeniably dated. On the bright side, anime cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game. There's also an anime portrait whenever they speak, which adds much needed detail to the characters (so you can see what they really look like).Music (score 7/10): Music is decent, nothing that would make you buy the soundtrack or anything. There are a couple vocal tracks in the game, which are also decent. Thankfully, Luna's singing voice isn't too grating on the ears. I still don't understand, though, why everyone in the game keeps referring to her amazing singing voice, when in my opinion, she is only average. Well anyway, there is limited voice acting in the game during scenes and also a couple battle phrases. The voice acting is pretty good; the only voice I'm glad we don't hear much of is Nall's, which I imagine would get really annoying (it's high-pitched and squeaky). You don't get to hear much voice acting anyway, since it's really only present during cutscenes.Characters (score 8/10): Characters are likeable and amusing. They do have a decent amount of depth to their personalities, so you really come to be attached to them. Because the story is so basic, the likeable characters are really what keep this game afloat. Also, some of the NPCs are downright hilarious!Story (score 7/10): Lunar is certainly no Final Fantasy VII. The story itself is pretty basic. You start off as Alex, who sets off on a quest to become a Dragonmaster (person of status who helps keep things in order and peace). Then the story falls into the old pattern of finding X number of things (in this case, 4 dragons) and saving the world from a power-hungry would-be ruler along the way. This is sort of the formula for every RPG in existence, but at least other games add in unique and intriguing twists on this old formula to keep things interesting. Lunar's storyline really has no extra twists or new concepts in it to keep things interesting (thus it relies on excellent characterization). I really wish the game had explored certain concepts in more detail, such as the why the Vile Tribe rejected Althena, Ghaleon's motivations, and Althena's personality, motivations, and origin. However, given the age of this game, the lack of story depth is forgivable. After all, almost all games made during this time period were pretty shallow story-wise.Battle System (score 8/10): Battles are a basic turn-based system. The usual attack, defend, magic, item commands. As an interesting twist, you can move around the battle screen, thus making position a part of strategy. The only complaint I have with battles is that there is an A.I. command, whereby you can have the battle automatically fought for you. I didn't really like this because the option is listed first in the menu, which means you'll spend some time accidentally hitting it. It would've been better if they'd put it at the bottom of the menu. Well, this isn't really a big deal since the cursor in the game remembers where you last had it and always starts up there. So, once you turn on the game and select command, the next battle will have the cursor already on command. This was quite convenient.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me. One thing of note is that the menu system was a bit confusing, at least for me. I really felt that it was needlessly complicated and I never quite got the hang going through it quickly. It's rather annoying having every party member have their own equip menu when you could just have one big equip option, and then just select a character from there. I also hated having to physically put equipment in the person's hand before I could equip it. It would've been better to just let me select a person, and then have every available piece of equipment in inventory for them pop up in a list. Shuffling items from Nall's inventory to each individual character's inventories is a pain, especially if their inventory is full, and you have to move items out first. Well, anyway, also of note is the leveling system. Bosses are always the same level as Alex is, but regular enemies all have their own preset levels. This means that you must strike a delicate balance between under-leveling and over-leveling. I really liked this feature since it kept you from having to level grind all the time. Also, enemies appear onscreen--so there are no random battles, which is awesome. Overall, the gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable, especially for an older game.Overall (score 7/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score. Overall, this was a decent, enjoyable game. Even though the story isn't the best, I really enjoyed the characters and they kept me playing. Is this game worth playing? Yes. Is this game worth the eventual $90 I had to spend on it? Definitely not. I personally don't think this game is worth more than $40. If you can find it for less than that, then go for it. If not, then you might want to try the GBA remake, Lunar Legend (though I don't know how good it is, since I've never played it). If you don't happen to ever play this game, then it's no real loss since there are plenty of contemporary RPG's available that are much better.",4,"So, you ask, is this old-school game still worth playing?",1235779200,"02 28, 2009",0.1383
7,A1EHPSG1JK3C0V,B00000JIUG,Jeff Brugamyer,"[1, 1]","I had just started playing rpg's when I picked this one up, it was probably my third or fourth rpg that I played. I absolutely fell in love with this game the moment it started. I never played the orignal or second on the Sega CD.Storyline: What can I say, its your typical boy loves girl, girl gets kidnapped and boy saves world and girl. Fortunately, rpg's are great not because of the story but how the story is told and Working Designs did a brilliant job in the storytelling. They took the story and put a few twists here and there but not to the extreme or completely insane, they left it a simple story and made it an epic masterpiece. Lastly, this game has one of the most memorable villians in an rpg to date. Ghaleon is a great villian who has a great background story that unfolds extremely well during the game and in my eyes he ranks right up there with Sephiroth.Combat system: For whatever reasons Working Designs left it simple and turn based and keeping to the sprites instead of trying to make the fights 3-D. With games like FFVII, Legaia and others going 3-D this gave a lot of ridicule to the game itself, a very unfortunate thing too. It was nice for the characters to have only certain things they could do, like Alex could only use special sword attack and no magic as where Jessica could only use magic. It kept the fighting more tactical and also made everyone in the group important and not just a space filler.Graphics: Working Designs kept to the sprites and kept it looking a 32 bit rpg. They did do something to keep the story moving along with anime clips, wonderfully done by the way, which they used to introduce characters and to help the storytelling.Music: The battle music gets repetitive and so does the traveling music as I think they could've done a better job in that department. The voice acting was done really well but the women's voices do get a bit high pitched at times and it happens to the guys on occasion.The characters were developed nicely, each having their own background story which adds to your liking and caring about each of your character in your party. You can easily put 50+ hours in the game and also there are whats called Bromides to collect. Bromides are anime pictures in the game which you can collect throughout your travels-I believe there are 12 in all.Extras Disc: I watched it and enjoyed the voice actors and developers talking about how much fun they had making the game and what they did to add what they thought would help the game out.This game despite its old-school graphics and traditional fighting system gets a 5 out of 5 for its wonderful story and loveable characters.",5,Can't say enough about this game....,1223510400,"10 9, 2008",0.509
8,A2602Z4LZ70KE3,B00000JIUG,Jigen Bryan,"[4, 4]","Originally released back on the Sega Saturn, Working Designs ports it over to the Playstation, VERY NICELY. The original great game is here, with a few good enhancments. The best one being the Anime scenes. Very well done, and they help move the story along nicely. The game's not up to par with the likes of most Final Fantasy games, or many other Square/Enix RPG's, but it's definitely a must have for any RPG fan.Gameplay: 8.1/10I'll start with the battle system. The battles you run into to aren't random; you can see them on the screen, and avoid some of them if you don't want to battle. A lot of them are impossible to avoid, though; this is needed, so you aren't just running through the game not fighting. You have the usual attack, run, and skills during the battles. When you have your character do a physical attack, he will move to the enemie he's attacking and stay in that spot while the enemies do their attacks. Some of the enemy attacks will move your character a spot or two back. This way, there's some strategy involved on the placement of your character. Each enemy has a certain amount of spots it can move, so if you want to stay away from some of them, don't attack an enemy that's surrounded by other enemies, because they all will be in attacking range, and they will all get a good attack in on you. A lot of the times, I didn't really worry about this, but it's a little added strategy to the battles other than the usual fighting. One of the more useful ways of taking advantage of this, though, is to defend on one turn, let the enemies move close to you, and then hack and slash away. This way, you don't move in without getting an attack on your enemy, and letting them attack you. Be smart, and you can avoid a hit here and there. The battles are turn based, by the way; none of that meter stuff seen in most Final Fantasy games. Really either way is good to me.The way skills are learned in this game is just your basic learn a skill at a certain level system. Example: Learn a small healing spell at level 5. There's no custom way of learning your attacks. You have to realize, that this came out in the early 90's, where there was only a game here and there had a deep system to go along with it. It gets the job done, but it's not as advanced as some RPG'ers would like. I didn't mind, though. Don't let this turn you away from the game. You will miss out on a memorable experience if you do.The areas in this game are big, good looking, and fun to work your way through. Your usual RPG stuff is here. Caves, Villages, Castles, etc. They offer up a good challenge, too, which you can't say about a lot of RPG's out there. It's not impossible by any means, but it's not easy either. Good challenge. The world you travel through is well designed, and pretty big. As a whole, you won't find a bad or boring level in this game. It's an expansive RPG world, with many fun challenges along the way.The characters are very good. They are pretty artistic. A couple basic looking ones, but overall, they have my pick as some of the better ones in an RPG, ever. The character development is not too bad, either. It's not the best, but you should soon care for each character atleast a little. Especially the main ones like Alex, and Luna.I like the story a lot. You wont find a deep, complex plot. You get a straight-foward, hero defeating the villian, type of story. There's a good surprise here and there, but not many. You will grow to hate the villians, and the story, while not being too complex, pulls you in and doesn't let you go until you finish the game. I guarantee you will enjoy it.I take off the 1.9 because the battle system can get repetitive near the end of the game. The boss battles have you basically using the same spell per character each turn, hoping you have enough left to finish him off. This makes the usual fun boss fights, a little less fun than normal. Atleast they're challenging, though, since they always have the same level as your characters. I didn't take off any more for the semi-basic storyline, and not so deep skill learning system because of the time it came out. That's something you have to realize when playing this game: it was one of the best for it's time.Replay Value: 6.5/10As with a lot of RPG's, it's not very good. I, and many will play through again for the positives I mentioned above, but there's really no incentive to come back and play through the 25+ hour quest again. Only for the hardcore RPGer, I guess.Music: 8.2/10Overall, some very nice tunes scattered through out the game. It's not mind blowing like some of the Square soundtracks, but it's a good one. You will enjoy it for the most part, I know I did.Graphics: 9/10I'm basing it on the year it came out. The levels,and battle graphics look stunning. With that said, though, the characters suffered and look pretty bland. That's the reason for the 1 point off. Not a major problem at all, though. Especially when you play this one for the gameplay, like all RPG's.Overall:(Not an average) 8.5/10For it's time, it offered a fun battle system, great graphics, a good story, and clever, fun level design. One of the best games in the genre at the time, and rightfully so. It has taken a slight hit over the years, but overall, it has stood the test of time pretty well. RPG fans would be wise to not miss out on this. With the special package one, you get tons of extra goodies; well worth the money, although it's only possible to find it on sites like Ebay. If you find it, go for it. You will not be disappointed in the slightest at this classic RPG.I recommend Lunar 2 as well.

The graphics and color have recieved a noticable face lift, some areas have been edited or cut altogether, and a few items have also been left out. The music (a prime feature in the Sega CD version) has been reworked also, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. Another new feature is how you encounter enemies.

For one, you got wayy more spells on the Sega Cd version! The story line was better! And the music was better! And the gameplay hours are about the same. However, the Graphics are better on this one and it has wayyy more cartoons! THATS IT! I love this game, but Working Designs didin't put enouph effort into it! You think they would at least put out a way better version on Playstation but oviously it was just a quick process to make a few bucks! But it is a good game and I would recomend it! The enemys are more chalanging then most RPGS, and the voice programing is awsome! PLuse the battle systum rocks! But I wish the story line was as good as the old one......",3,A BIG LET DOWN!

I'd rather see a realistic cartoon than an annoying, jerky 3-D anytime. The music is beautiful and I'd catch myself humming the opening theme occasionally at work. The anime artwork in some of the scenes is breathtaking and the storyline is engaging. I am looking forward to the sequel which will be coming out around the 29th of November.",5,Hurry Up and Play This Game Because Lunar II is Coming Out!,973555200,"11 7, 2000",0.1218
