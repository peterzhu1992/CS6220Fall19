0,A3H4TIVTTA5IBB,B00000IWIW,Brian A. Wolters,"[1, 1]","Star Wars RACER features excellent graphics. You get your choice of pods and their corresponding character. During the race, the graphics are very smooth and the controls are very easy to master. During the first few races, expect to break lap records in finish first. In the harder levels, expect nose-to-nose finishes. The only drawback is that the game is pretty much the same from start to finish. This is a must have and still today, it will show off your graphics card!",3,Great Graphics and Gameplay,975196800,"11 26, 2000",0.1446
1,AKBH21PTTCWVJ,B00000IWIW,D. Bass,"[11, 11]","This is probably one of the most exciting and intense racing games I have ever played. Set in the Star Wars universe, this is definitely one that's sure to last a long, long time.It's a surprisingly long game, although it didn't take too long to beat. It also has great replay value, and I enjoy it now just as much as I did when I first purchased it. Throughout the game, and as you advance through the various courses, you will be able to implement the money you earn to purchase better parts for your particular pod racer. As you advance, you'll also be able to select more powerful (and occasionally weaker) pods to test out. Run through each of them, and see which fits you best. It might be the difference between coming out on top, or being involved in the biggest explosion since the Death Star!There's also an amazing score of wonderful John Williams music from Episode I. There are various tracks for each course, and they add an even better thrill to the game. The graphics are also very good, much better than on the N64. If you have a good computer, and a decent 3D card, you should have no problems. I have a 300Mhz system with a Voodoo2, and it rocked!All in all, LucasArts has done it again! May the force be with you! (Believe me, you'll need it!)",5,The Best Racer Game to hit the Market!,959644800,"05 30, 2000",0.4564
2,A1SF5QI677TQYK,B00000IWIW,Jason Anderson,"[4, 4]","I bought it (when it first came out) for full price... and thought I might have wasted my money...let me tell ya...NO WAY..I didn't waste ONE penny...It's like racing indy cars but much faster, they turn easier and they fly...:)...There are 4 levels to this game. Level one has 7 races, all aare pretty easy. After you finish the level, you are given access to one level in level 4...each level is the same, but each getting harder...there are 4 races in level four, and let me tell ya...THEY ARE HARD!!!!!!! :)...!!! :)...(I still havn't completed races 3 and 4 in level 4!!!)...The Graphics are TOP NOTCH!! The compant, Lucasarts produces the best graphics in computer games. The game follows the story line of the movie well. Sure, the tracks are on differant planets than just Tatooine, but hey; It's fun! :) I love the game. And the characters from the movie, you can play all of them. The ONE thing that is not like the movie (BUT I'M GLAD IT IS ON THE GAME) is the &quot;YOU GET A NEW PODRACER&quot; feature when you crash...It's a life saver!!!ALL AROUND, I GIVE THIS GAME A 2, maybe 3, thumbs up.JASON ANDERSON",5,WOW!!

4,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00000IWIW,tropic_of_criticism,"[12, 13]","If you think that the &quot;Star Wars Episode 1: Racer&quot; is an effort to cash in on the _Phantom Menace_ hype, you vastly underestimate the talent at Lucasarts. As usual, they top expectations and deliver something far beyond a merchandising tie-in. This is a product which pushes the boundaries of the racing genre. Take this feature-rich game out of the Star Wars Universe and you still have a thrilling, easily-networkable ride.The large number of different racers with different qualties is somewhat _pro forma_ nowadays in the genre, but Lucasarts takes the idea one step further. By winning purses, you earn money with which to upgrade your racer. Thus there are a number of useful configurations which are only possible through victory.The number and quality of camera angles is equally impressive. In fact, the cockpit view is downright revolutionary. From this vantage point, you feel the 400-mph+ speeds, and it's comparatively harder in this camera to complete tricky courses.Where the game flags, I suppose, is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film. There's no ability to eliminate opposition by &quot;dirty tricks&quot;, and you can't disable the &quot;i-crashed-but-now-i-have-a-new-racer&quot; feature. The pod racers are absolutely indestructible here (though they can be seriously damaged) and that's a disappointment. I would've liked a &quot;harder-edged&quot; version--perhaps one you could toggle on and off--but it's a small complaint for an otherwise stunning effort.",4,Breathtaking graphics make you forget it's not loyal to film,947203200,"01 7, 2000",0.0371
