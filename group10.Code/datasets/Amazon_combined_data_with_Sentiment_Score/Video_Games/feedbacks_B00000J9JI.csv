0,A25APFN07P2KB0,B00000J9JI,Ben,"[0, 0]","Forget all those 3D games that are practically carbon copies of one another, constantly ripping off the character concepts that Street Fighter invented. This is the definitive fighting game for the Playstation.The graphics will be familiar to anyone who's played Street Fighter or the Alpha series, but they do have a newer, fresher anime style about them. The large anime drawing of the characters after they win a match is also very cool. They animate very well, much better than in Marvel vs. Capcom. The sound effects are also great, and the music is excellent. My only minor complaint about the music is that the classic character themes are gone. I preferred the old classic songs to these new ones. But, that's not too big of a deal.Anyone who says this game has no depth simply doesn't have a clue about its system. Each character has three different fighting styles, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Some moves and super moves are only available in certain fighting styles. Some fighting styles are better for attacking, and others are better defense, counters, and reversals.The super moves are not as spectacular as a Capcom vs. title, but they're still excellent in themselves. They are also not insanely powerful, unless the character has been trained and leveled up a whole lot. Which brings me to my next favorite aspect of this game:The World Tour mode. This was a great addition to Street Fighter. Some say it's been ripped off from Soul Edge or Soul Caliber, but considering how badly other games have ripped off Street Fighter over the years (all the SF clones on the SNES, and even Tekken rips off the characters now), I don't think that argument can stand. This mode allows you to choose a character and go on a world tour, fighting lots of matches with different stipulations, such as super combos only, multiple opponents, etc. As you do this, your character raises levels and gains new abilities, perhaps being able to use some abilities that his fighting style would not normally allow. You also gain the ability to change your balance of power, making your character lean more toward offense to hit harder, or defense to take less damage, or remain neutral.In fact, this game has all sorts of cool extra features to be unlocked, as well as secret characters. Now, there are not many secret characters at all, but those that are there are far better than most of the ones in Tekken (Come on now--you can't seriously hope to compare Gon, Mokujin, or even True Ogre to Shin Akuma). The other features include the Dramatic Battle, which lets you fight 2 on 1 against the computer at high difficulty, the Survival Mode, which lets you see how far you can get as both the difficulty and number of simultaneous opponents increase, and the Final Battle, which simply lets you choose any character and fight the last boss so that you don't have to play them all the way through the Arcade Mode. With all these cool extras, plus the fact that the Arcade Mode actually has a good story behind it, this game never runs out of replay value. You're always looking for something new to try, or just to pop the game in for a quick play.One of the coolest aspects of this game is its characters. There is a huge variety to choose from, and each is played differently than the next. At the same time though, none of the characters really seem silly or out of place, except perhaps Rainbow Mika... That's a matter of opinion I guess.Overall, this is the best Street Fighter game I've ever played, and the best fighting game in general that I've ever played. It's easily worth 5 stars, perhaps with a half a star removed for not using the classic tunes.",5,The Fighting genre at its finest.,996537600,"07 31, 2001",0.2882

It has awesome game modes cool levels and best of all its the never ending fun of a 2d fighter. The graphics are what you would expect froma 3d fighter a little choppy and an occasional glitch or two or maybe an occasional mergence of fighters but all in all its one of my favorite game out there. Ihave been an avis street fighter fan all the way back to the SNES version of street fighter 2 turbo! i would encourage anybody to get street fighter alpha 3 because its fun and hey its down to 20 bucks now!,5,What can i say its street fighter,976924800,"12 16, 2000",0.7328

Batica,"[0, 0]","Street Alpha 3 really rocked in the Arcades and when they brough it to the homes of millions on the PSone, it still rocked, it looked great and of course how could you forget the many characters you had to choose from. In total (I want to say) 34 or 35? total characters including hidden characters. A definite up scale from the original Street Fighter Alpha where there's only 8 or 10 characters and 2 of which you could've easily done without (Sodom and Birdie).Also in this one, the special moves changed because now you got to chose which set you wanted which was cool for some characters and detrimental to the success of some of the other characters.I'd still definately get this one because it's that good and even so, how could you not continue to collect the Street Fighter series? PLEASE! You know you want to so go ahead and get it!",5,Should be very high on any gamers rankings!,1036540800,"11 6, 2002",0.3548
4,A3KYUMPEHRT8JB,B00000J9JI,HBK Muziktodriveby,"[0, 0]","Now most people will read the title and think he must talking about the game. After all this is the third game in the Alpha series. No, I called this review that because this is my third copy of Alpha 3 lol. I had the Alpha Anthology first, then I got Alpha 3 Max on the PSP, now I have this. So, why get this game. Simply put I have an arcade stick and I want to play it with that on my PS3. So, I had to buy it again in order to do that. This game plays like and dream and looks great. I am impressed at how well the PS1 handled this game. It looks like the Anthology version which I would assume is the best, just because the hardward in more advanced. You really cannot tell the difference between the two other than load times existing in this version and not in that one. Ima keep this brief if you like Street Fighter you need to own this. This really needs to be a game Capcom puts online. I don't know if there is much of an out cry for it but there should be. Its up there to me as one of the all time greats. With Capcom vs SNK 2 and other great 2-D games of that era. Its fun, its bright and viberant its just one of the best SF games ever made period.",5,Three times the charm.............,1310860800,"07 17, 2011",0.2876

6,A6VFFRIHAXKRL,B00000J9JI,J. Paul John doe,"[0, 0]",While eveverybody says Street Fighter III the 3rd strike is there favorite SF game & I do think it should be up there with Street Fighter II & IV Street Fighter Alpha 3 is my favorite Street Fighter game the Alpha series takes place before Street Fighter II basically the Alpha series as a whole tells the story of Akuma killing Ryu & Ken's master & Akuma going around & killing people & M.Bison taking over Shadowloo trying to capture Ryu for his Psycho Drive Ryu travelling around the world to be the best Ken's desire for a rematch with Ryu. Charlie Nash & Chun Li investigating Shadowloo & trying to bring Bison to justice. Sagat after losing to Ryu joins Shadowloo Cammy turning against Shadowloo. Now I just want to put this little update I want to talk about the other version of Street Fighter Alpha 3 the Japaneese only Sega Saturn port. The Playstation version is very good but this is my opinion this is the best port. When you start out Guile Evil Ryu are already in the game. This version is almost arcade perfect & you don't have to unlock any of the characters. Evil Ryu being in this game fits for future referance in the later games espically Street Fighter IV. Guile figures into the plot he's going to find Charlie who The Military think has goneAWOL Charile's fate is different if you play as Guile. It does add plot points & connects to SF II very well. It plays well it's perfect for the Ascii arcade stick or the regular Saturn controller. This is closer to the arcade version it does play better than the Playstatin version. You will need a Action Replay 4MB RAM cart if you choose to get this but this game can be expensive I got mine for $130 I believe it depends on how big of a Street Fighter fan you are I mean if you have Street Fighter Alpha 1&2 on Saturn it's a great finish to the series. It is my favorite game in the Alpha series.Pretty much the entire Alpha series is story driven & I can't do the games justice but I do recommend it to Street Fighter fans or anybody that's serious about getting into fighting games in general.,5,Review quickie Street Fighter Alpha 3 revised on 12/23/10,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",0.346
7,A3E6LFV7XEGACM,B00000J9JI,K. Tucker,"[1, 1]","Alpha 3 is the culmination of everything Capcom had worked towards with their fighting games. Everyone knows Capcom has the habit of sticking to similar concepts for several games in a row (Mega Man, Resident Evil, etc), but in no other case has the last game in a series before a major change been so fulfilling.Street Fighter Alpha 3 is (in my opinion) the best Street Fighter game available (including the recently-released SF2 HD Remix). The gameplay is a blend of the slow-paced and strategic Street Fighter 2 and the more varied and frenetic Alpha series. Air combos, alpha counters, and flashy finishing moves combine with superior character balancing and deep fighting strategy.The main arcade experience can be brutally hard, as it would be in the wishes of any Street Fighter fan. The two-player experience is also extremely fun, as players new to the Alpha series can choose different fighting modes, one of which (X-ism) is more aligned with classic SF2 balancing. Other modes include A-ism, the Alpha standard, and V-ism, a mode that enhances a player's ability to chain standard and special moves together for lethal damage.Alpha 3 introduced an incredible World Tour mode, enabling players to tour the world (if you will) fighting various characters under various conditions. These tasks may be as simple as defeating an opponent to as complex as defeating three opponents with only super combo moves whilst your character is low on health. Completing these objectives unlock abilities that can be linked to your character, such as automatic blocking, taking zero damage while blocking, infinite guard, and more. On top of that, characters built up during World Tour mode are playable in other many of the other modes.The other gameplay modes include training, boss battle, survival, and more. Two-player battles can also accommodate multiple player characters, in both versus and cooperative (ie P1 and P2 vs C1 and C2, or P1 and P1 vs P2 and P2). Two-player back in the days of SSF2:Turbo was the only way to play, but Alpha 3 dramatically increased the available options for single players. These lend towards the game's long life, as one player can play in various modes ranging from standard arcade style to fighting bosses to survival mode and more.In essence, Street Fighter Alpha 3 defines fighting games of the Playstation era. It is a smooth balance of speed and strategy. Though the graphics are dated by today's standards, two-dimensional games tend to age gracefully, and this game is no exception. Street Fighter fans owe it to themselves to own a copy of Alpha 3, if not to check a popular franchise's history, then to own the best Street Fighter game ever made.",5,The Ultimate Street Fighter game,1228780800,"12 9, 2008",0.0574

11,A3EU0FX5OZZ32P,B00000J9JI,neomurtle,"[3, 3]","Street Fighter Alpha 3 is the best Street Fighter experience one can have on the original Playstation. With well over 20 characters selectable from the outset, classic Street Fighter gameplay, and multiple gameplay modes, this is one fighting game worthy of adding to any gamer's library. There are a few faults though. Some animation problems are present here and there (some characters have newly animated moves that don't quite fit with their old set of animation frames), the endings could have had more attention paid to them, and some of the music is rather bland. Also, for those of you who may not know, the Alpha series is supposed to take place between the events of the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2. So why are we seeing characters appear that are from the later versions of Street Fighter 2, such as Deejay, Fei Long, T. Hawk and Cammy? Even though Capcom may need to work on the story a bit, it's still nice to see all of the Street Fighters together in one game, so I'm not complaining. Even though there have been countless versions of Street Fighter before it, Street Fighter Alpha 3 proves that you can't beat a classic formula, and that the series is still very enjoyable. Unless you're completely burnt out on 2D fighting games, I recommend picking up Street Fighter Alpha 3 for either Playstation or Dreamcast.",4,The best version of Street Fighter next to SF3: 3rd Strike,998265600,"08 20, 2001",0.2505
12,AWI8LGUNYD15T,B00000J9JI,Steven Wong,"[0, 0]",Alpha 3 has a roster that will take you months to master each character. I haven't seen so many Street Fighter characters (31) in one game before for the PS and PS2. The unique feature of this game is the ISM system where you can choose which finisher move you want. The best feature is the World Tour which is practically a Street Fighter RPG (why can't the new Street Fighter games have this?!) where you level up your character as you win matches.,5,This is the ONLY Street Fighter game you need on your Playstation and even Playstation 2,1390608000,"01 25, 2014",0.3304
