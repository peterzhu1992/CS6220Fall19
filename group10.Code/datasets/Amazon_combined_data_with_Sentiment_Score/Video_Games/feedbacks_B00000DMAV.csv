0,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00000DMAV,ACEMAN1 HERE TO PISS YOU OFF,"[0, 0]","The very first Grand Theft Auto is likely the most forgotten, and for good reasons. Though there is fun to be had in this game, it is marred by one of the worst control schemes I have ever experienced, the top-down camera is awful, and the combat mechanics suck. The graphics are quite ugly as well. The overall presentation is a mess because of poor development skills the development team had apparently. Like I said this title is passable overall, but it is marred by some huge issues which is probably why it's forgotten.",3,BARELY PASSABLE 5 OUT OF 10,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",-0.1776

The gameplay is rock-solid, and the game moves really fast. Camera is great, as the whole game is viewed from a bird's eye perspective. The game is very open ended, and you will never get bored while playing this.",5,The game that started everything.,1028592000,"08 6, 2002",0.3995

4,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B00000DMAV,Micheal Hunt,"[4, 8]","I just wanna review out something no ones said yet.If you still ever play this game, it is a great game, it's 5 stars, provided your into this sort of thing.But recently when i played the playstation version, i noticed they jibbed out and didnt include certain things that the PC version and better version had.First off - There is no train. The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure, it may be useless to crash into another train, but it was entertaining. The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet, it has the tracks for it, so go figure that one out.Next, lack of vehicles. The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.And something no one can say wouldnt be better... you can edit the PC version, not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself, but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools. You can not just add cars, you can add missions, put more cars into things, edit the exsisting map, or hell, make your own city from scratch.When I play this game, i like to ride around in Knight Rider, or maybe the General Lee, try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis... gouranga!Convinced the PC versions better? Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking, huh?",1,"Play this on PC, the Playstation version is not the full version",1164412800,"11 25, 2006",0.2371
5,A3HA702TWWHP87,B00000DMAV,Mike Sean Clifton,"[0, 0]","I remember when my parents got me this game for Christmas 8 years ago! That was good times! Liberty City's based on New York City featuring Brocklyn based on Brooklyn, Kings based on Queens, Brix based on Bronx, Manhaddan based on Manhattan, but no island based on Staten Island! Liberty City's bordered by the Garden State of New Guernsey based on the Garden State of New Jersey! Very decent graphics by 1997 standards! Realistic car controls! Realistic gun fights! No so realistic fist fights. Good music! There are 2 more cities to unlock such as the unidentified city in the Golden State of San Andreas based on San Francisco, California and Vice City in the Sunshine State of Florida based on Miami, Florda! So get out there, grab a car, and have some fun!",5,GOOD TIMES!,1327104000,"01 21, 2012",0.1034

If your a GTA fan but haven't played this it is a must to truly understand how great and innovated this series is and has become.

7,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B00000DMAV,N. Durham Big Evil,"[2, 2]","The original Grand Theft Auto was a classic for the PC, but it's gleefully unabashed violence, simple graphics, dark humor, and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy. Eventually Take 2 Interactive (now they're called Rockstar) published GTA on as many systems as it could: the PS1, Dreamcast, and even the Game Boy Color. These days anyone and everyone are GTA nuts, but only when it comes to GTA 3 or Vice City. The original GTA may seem simple enough, but it is undeniably fun for the most part, no matter how simplistic the graphics seem. The missions can get rather tedious, and the fact you can't save your progress in game (a problem which would be corrected in GTA 3), and eventually you'll lose interest, but for the most part the original GTA is still loads of fun. Those who have only played GTA 3 or Vice City will not like this original installment, but it's a great ride while it lasts.",4,"In it's time, it was an underground classic",1039737600,"12 13, 2002",0.2883

Thankfully they fixed this in GTA 3 &amp; 4. Those games are incredible.

Oliver,"[7, 9]","and you just became part of it.Pros:Brought violence and profanity in videogames to a whole new levelVery good sound effectslong enjoyable levels and misionsA short, but destructable arsenoalVery useful cheat codes(Despit I usally don't cheat)Pretty good musicCons:The graphics are plain out horribleone shot death(A bit too realistic)well, unless you have armorCan't save until you beat a leveldefinitly not for kidsThe game suffers from slowdowns, if too many things are on the screenIn 98 this game was jst a instant classic, despite being overshadowed by loads of games(especially Metal Gear Solid, and Zelda:Ocorina of time). It's definitly unknown since GTA 3 and Vice City overshadowed it by a loooong mile, but yet I still play this game from time to time. In this game you could even say ... the police and let them eat the gat, take out a squad of them with a machine gun, blaze them up with a flame thrower, or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcher(That was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy). If you're used to GTA 3 or Vice City, then this game will hardly be interesting to you, but if you have this game, then I'm sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you, and took you on the crazy ride from this, all the way to vice city.Final Words:Speaking of Vice City, That was one of the levels in this game, and so was liberty City, and San Anderess is the last city. Could San Andress be the next Grand Theft Auto? Hmmmm...peace",4,"The streets is a dirty, dirty way of life...",1052611200,"05 11, 2003",0.1132
