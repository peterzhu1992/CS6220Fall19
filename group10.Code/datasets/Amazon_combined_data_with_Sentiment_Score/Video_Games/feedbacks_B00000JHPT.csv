0,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,B00000JHPT,ACEMAN1 HERE TO PISS YOU OFF,"[2, 2]","Wow, Superman! This game has earned the lowest review score I have ever given a game (and I've given some rather s***ty scores), and the second lowest score I have given a product I've reviewed. I find it absolutely sickening when some of the people who reviewed this game; like ShaqFu (A guy who named himself after what many people would proclaim as the worst fighting game of all time and one of the worst games of all time, mind you), said that this game was a masterpiece and quote on quote, This is by far the best game on the N64. WHAT?! You're not serious are you? This is definitely not the best game on the N64, it is without a doubt the worst game to plague the N64. That's like the stupid people who say the that the God-awful Gamecube was way better than the PS2 and Xbox, it's not an opinion, it's the truth that those things suck. To show my love for the N64, instead I will give you a list of my personal favorite N64 titles you should play instead of this:1. Perfect Dark2. Starfox 643. Conker's Bad Fur Day4. Resident Evil 25. Mario Kart 646. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater7. Spider-Man8. Star Wars Episode I Racer9. Road Rash 6410.Pilotwings 6411.San Francisco Rush series12.Goldeneye 00713.Turok seriesetc., etc., etc.There, go play those instead. Those games are a million times better each than this game will ever be. Now let's talk about the glorious Superman 64 in all of its greatness!WHAT THE GAME IS: The story seems straight out of an award-winning movie. Superman's friends have been kidnapped by Lex Luthor and thrown into a virtual metropolis. Superman must go save his friends and the world from the evil deeds of Lex. This game feels like a Pilotwings/Beat 'em up/Find the button game.GRAPHICS: The people who gave this game 5-star reviews said the graphics are amazing. Are they? Why yes, if you think a game that looks like a PSone game made on a budget of $10 or it looks someone vomited Fruity Pebbles all over the TV screen, then yes it does look fantastic. Absolutely mind-blowing especially with the numerous glitches in the environments. The programming work done by Titus is stunning indeed. Superman can go through walls unexpectedly or can stuck in random places and will be unable to move for a brief period of time. Wow, Titus!MUSIC: The musical score is truly amazing. It's the kind of musical score that makes a person want to drown some kittens when they hear it. I want this composer's hand then slap them across the face and tell them, Wow, way to suck!SOUND: The sound effects seem like they were recorded in a basement. Everything is too quiet or it echoes. Another accomplished feat for the guys who made this game. Even something as simple as sound effects suck.GAMEPLAY: During my playthrough of the game this is how the missions went; Fly through the rings! Pick up those cars before those people get crushed! Fly through more rings! Pick up that police car and take it to the other side of the road! Fly through more rings! Beat those four thugs armed with guns! Fly through more rings! Use your ice breath to stop those tornadoes from sucking up those people! Fly though more rings! Go into a building! Beat up robots and find a keycard! Insert keycard then go to an elevator to another with even more robots to beat up! Destroy those robots, open those doors, and rescue those people underground! Go disarm bombs, and along the way beat up more robots, a tank, and a woman who has better skills than you do! The repetition goes on and on and on. This game is very repetitive. Extremely repetitive to be exact. And very broken too. Overall, this game plays out like Pilotwings, except you break the controls, and the make the dated visuals even worse.OVERALL: If you enjoy life and don't wish to pollute the classic N64 stay away from this horrible game. I'm surprised Nintendo didn't do what Atari did with E.T. for the Atari 2600. Destroy thousands of copies and bury them in New Mexico. Worst of all there's a Nintendo Seal of Quality on the box. How did nobody stand up to say, This game sucks, that's all it would have taken.THE GOOD: (This category has been left blank for obvious reasons).THE BAD: Everything.

1,A1HJOYTU965TWU,B00000JHPT,Alex Jenkins,"[3, 4]",If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game. All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts. It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere. Even if this game was a buck it's so bad it couldn't even be a novelty. People who know this game might even make fun of you. Anyways I don't think there will ever be a good superman game it's sad.,1,Don't buy this game,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",-0.0983
2,A2582KMXLK2P06,B00000JHPT,B. E Jackson,"[0, 1]","I feel so hypnotically enchanted floating through endless rings as Superman with the distant soaring effects peacefully sounding in the background. For the first few minutes Superman seems challenging as an early 3D experiment to figure out which ideas work and which ones can be tossed aside and... you'd certainly *think* that floating through ring after ring would get boring after a while but... the opposite happens. You get unusually attached to the endless task.After a while these floating rings just seem to call my name. It's like I'm destined to fly through them for all eternity. I don't want to do anything else in life but fly through these hypnotic rings. Sometimes I bump into bad guys and shoulder bash them away, other times I pick up items and toss them at specific targets but... the rings. They always call me back for several minutes of peaceful daydreaming hypnotism at its purest. I'm enthralled in this games beauty. The graphics are decent too. I have to go now. The rings are waiting for me. *stares off into space*",3,so many rings... I want more,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",0.1614

5,AD7IBJCYSJ9EE,B00000JHPT,Destitute,"[3, 3]","Bad games happen all the time, but only the worst of the worst are talked about years after their release. Superman 64 is just one of those games. Receiving no positive reception when it was released in '99, it is a laughing joke and quite a disgrace to the Man of Steel. This looks like a job for...a hammer to smash the cartridge with.GRAPHICS: Bad, even for its time. Blocky characters compiled with glitches in movement and glitches in general. The town is full of 'kryptonite fog', which is just an excuse for the lack of perception in the town. Simply inexcusable.MUSIC: The same repetitive tunes, over and over and over and over...STORY: How long did it take for Titus to think of this epic story. Pretty much, Lex Luthor traps Superman's friends in a virtual world, and for some reason, Superman flies through rings and saves virtual people on his way to finding them.CONTROLS: I once recall someone on Gamefaqs saying that Superman controls like a 500 pound man on drugs. That's an understatement. Taking off and flying requires lots of work, while Superman himself steers like a drunk driver.GAMEPLAY: Before starting a stage, you have to start a series of awful missions. For some reason, Superman flies through rings, rings, and more rings, and this is quite difficult with the godawful controls. After that, Superman does odd missions such as saving people from cars, beating shadows, or stopping tornadoes with his ice breath. Note that all of this is virtual, so why is he bothering to save them? Then after that, he flies through more rings, does a mission, more rings, and eventually the level begins. The levels themselves are terrible as well, filled with glitches and the fact that Superman is super weak. He is the Man of Steel, yet an explosion is enough to kill him. After the level is completed, the whole cycle starts all over again. As with all Titus games, to fully complete it you must play on the hardest difficulty, which is just plain stupid.BUY: No! Stay away at all costs and don't let it corrupt your N64. Well, if you are interested, get it on an emulator, because even paying a dollar for this game is asking too much.",1,Don't play this game if you're suicidal.,1235088000,"02 20, 2009",-0.1315

When I was a kid, I didn't understand a game could be bad and simply thought I was doing something wrong and kept playing until I finally accepted this game is awful. The control in this game is really bad, especially during the ring stages. You'll just fly all over the place. The first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly, but you have a time limit, so you don't have time to move slowly. When I got to a point where I could fight, it was like a maze and had no idea where to go. The ONLY reason anyone should buy this game is for game collecting only, and even then, they should save this when they are scraping the bottom of the barrel.",1,I still remember the headaches,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",-0.2332

The Story is even worse, you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping, so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun, but it gets dull fast.

16,AZ9JWGE1UGKZA,B00000JHPT,R.A. McKenzie,"[7, 8]","In Kill Bill: Vol. 2, David Carradine described Superman as follows, Not a very good comic; not particularly well-drawn. Well, I suppose if Caine from Kung Fu is talking about this character, then the game must be cool too, right? It's been almost 10 years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system. It must be good, since we're still talking about all these years later.Seriously, there's a lot to like about SUPERMAN 64. You won't need any sort of defect warranty, because the second you flip the POWER switch, it works every time. It's refreshing to buy an electronic device, knowing that it's electrical circuits will never fail you.Equally cool is that Superman flies in this game...I like it when he flies. Every time I pop in this cartridge, I'm even more eager to watch the Christopher Reeve movies...all 4 of them.The plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint. You see, there are bizarre, murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick wouldn't be able to visualize. For example, Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to, um...a blurry contraption that kidnaps them; or does it imprison them? I personally couldn't tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois, because it's very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes. But isn't it neat to figure it out for yourself? You see, because the graphics are so confusing and blurry, you get to keep playing again to unearth the game's secrets. And don't worry about completing SUPERMAN 64 in a short period of time, either. It's a tough game, and there are few games that equal its challenge.What's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman's emotional state. I'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly; it's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7. Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully. You see, when Superman flies, he won't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do. A free-spirited main character...brilliant!Lastly, Superman's powers are present here. He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath. That's always neat, huh? But what's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel --- according to this game --- has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists. He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky, and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis. How cool is that? On the other side of this spectrum, there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch......you know, I still haven't figured out how to beat those sections of the game. I wonder, is there a higher power known only to Superman? I ask, because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry. The most gifted scientists, researchers, cryptologists, artists, and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.SUPERMAN 64 is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming!*****THIS REVIEW WAS MEANT TO BE SARCASTIC AND SATIRICAL.

18,A39OZIQ7FATEU5,B00000JHPT,Skinr,"[0, 1]","I bought this game, and actually tried to play it, rather than giving it one star and paraphrasing the Angry Video Game Nerd. It's actually not as bad as most people would have you believe. Would I have paid $60 for it, even in 1999? No.The graphics are about average for the N64: nice but full of blurry textures and gourad shading, as well as a tiny draw distance. The stock music is odd, but the voice clips (thankfully, used sparingly) are crystal clear. Sadly, they don't do anything to make the story any less incomprehensible.Now, we move on to the controls. Flying Superman is simple, if a little loose. Making tight turns is a problem, but you have a lot of freedom with the controls; you can even do a vertical loop without the need for a second analog stick (see Superman: Shadow of Apokolips). Getting him to stop is tricky, which can be a hassle if you need to land somewhere fast. Camera control (using the + Control Pad) allows you to rotate the camera around the Man of Steel, and his movement with the Control Stick is character-relative. Zooming in or out is also possible, so any Superman fans who want to make machinima about the last son of Krypton, go right ahead.For some reason, you can't save at all unless you have a Controller Pak; but when I did have one, it never prompted me to save, nor did it do so automatically. Perhaps I didn't get far enough into the game? There's not even a password feature, so playing later is difficult.The mission structure consists of vague objectives linked by timed flights through floating rings. Unless you have completely spastic fingers, the ring stages shouldn't be too hard; I was able to do the first one in two tries, not 100 (like many people seem to need).Overall, the game certainly isn't the worst ever made; not even close. It could have been so much more, but thankfully, people learned from the mistakes of Titus and made the much better Shadow of Apokolips and Superman Returns.",3,"Not the worst game ever, but not a great one either",1368921600,"05 19, 2013",0.2114
