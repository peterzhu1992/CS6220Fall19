It gives me space to write calendar urgencies upon a wall in an affordable way.It does not (nor do the instructions imply that it does) work with heavy pictures or mounting other heavy wall objects.Seeing the improvements made for its newest addition, this old product version will do the trick, but the newest version is most desirable (particularly for landlords and perfectionistic homeowners) for changing or taking down mounted products.",4,"Basic, but Use Sparingly",1307836800,"06 12, 2011",0.1112

Just be aware that the tape can pull off the top surface of any layered material.You can attach a fairly heavy object anywhere you want on a smooth, strong surface. An open-end wrench from a Model-T is currently attached to my toolbox fascia, strictly for aesthetic purposes.Most often, I use it for securing small rubber feet/pads at the bottom of items that live on tabletops, as well as securing shims of wood, cork, plastic, cardboard, metal, rubber, etc. onto the bottom of uneven items.If you need to re-attach or re-orient an object that had a single-use, peel-off sticky surface originally applied, this tape is your friend. The most common usage in that category is the deer whistles re-attachment on my car's front bumper. I always seem to find them on the ground where I park. Take the time to remove any residual gunk with a Goo-Gone/Dissolve-it -like solvent, and then some alcohol to get rid of any oily film, first.Just appreciate that this tape is permanent in the sense that disassembling the pieces it connects may damage them. You need to pry things off very slowly and carefully. It is also almost structural at the scale of flimsy plastic components, which seems to describe most objects these days.There is another variant - Heavy Duty double-sided tape (colored red, rather than white) for more massive items and those that you'd prefer to not ever come loose. It works almost like an epoxy. I used some most recently for attaching a rubber/foam door seal (intended for a garage door's bottom edge) as a threshold on a tile floor - 1 year on and it's still holding.Also, don't throw the packaging away, since it lists the strength of the adhesive, which is very convenient when you want to calculate how much to use. 1 wide tape is also available.This product is an indispensable item in my toolbox/fabrication drawer.

I have bought the two sided tapes for years now, for both business and personal needs.

If you mount a picture to a painted wall, for example, and then remove it the paint will most likely comme off with the tape.

Add to that, my size makes it difficult to tie shoes directly, so I tie them before I put them on, and use a shoe horn. The problem is the tongue of the shoe can get pushed into the shoe, slipping it on this way, and then the fit is wrong. I've tried to tie the strings to keep the tongue in place, but this had mixed benefits. I decided to try this two-sided tape, and it works great. I cut about two, one inch pieces, put them on the top of the tongue, and stuck them to the shoe top from within. The stick works pretty well and so I no longer have the problem.I believe the sticking power will also work in hanging some of my anime posters that tend to come down with regular tape. I might try this on some hooks as well, but I believe 3M has a better product for that application. This is not going to be much use for a carpet, windows, or larger applications, you don't get a lot of tape in the roll, and it's white, not clear, so unless hidden behind the use, you can see it.

This is just great for very lightweight objects or for holding heavier objects steady (where the tape is not actually supporting the *weight* of the object). For example, I have a heavy mirror mounted to my bedroom door by over-the-door hooks. Every time the door was closed, the mirror would swing behind, clapping against the door when it stopped. But by putting a square of Scotch's mounting tape behind each corner, the mirror stays firmly against the door (even with raucous kids running in and out). The great thing about this tape is that the foam layer helps compensate for a small amount of surface irregularity on the object or mounting surface.The package directions specify to use four inches of tape for each half pound of object weight, to a maximum of two pounds. For heavier applications, consider using Scotch'sexterior mounting tape, which is rated at being able to hold up to five pounds.For best adhesion and performance, really mash the tape in well, smoothing it all over, then apply very firm pressure against the mounted object over each point where you applied tape. Consider cleaning the wall with alcohol before applying tape to remove any oily residue from household cooking (even if it's not in the kitchen).",5,Great for lightweight applications,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",0.2286

Up until now, my solution has been to keep anything heavier than a poster off my walls, and posters just aren't exactly grown-up decor.Then I got this mounting tape. It's permanent, so I was very careful about finding a spot for a piece of lightweight art, a small piece of framed needlepoint. I followed the directions and used plenty of tape, and I wiped down the wall with alcohol before smushing the picture frame onto the wall. It holds perfectly.I've used a similar Scotch product that was cut into 1 squares, and wouldn't be without it. It holds my precious items onto my plate rail in the dining room, and keeps the photos on the picture rail. This product is even better - because it comes on a roll, it stays cleaner and dispenses more easily.Yet another Scotch product that's an absolute must in my house.

Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom. The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks, which supported the weight of the picture. All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter.

64,A23NSKTMSPPBTR,B00004Z498,Wayne,"[0, 0]","Scotch 1/2 inch Mounting Tape is a padded, double sided tape on a 75 inch roll. One side gets applied to an object, and the other side gets pressed against a surface on which you wish to mount your object. The cushion between the adhesive layers gives you flexibility when it comes to mounting objects that do not lie flat against one another.This mounting tape is designed to be permanent and is not repositionable. The user must take care to line up objects carefully when mounting them, and there is no guarantee that the surface of your walls will be completely immune to damage when this is removed. For some items, it might be helpful to mark its desired position before mounting, or use a small level.For some items, mounting tape is an ideal solution. For example, one of my children made an art project on a 36 square inch ceramic tile. There was no way to nail it to a wall, and adhesive hangers with flaps for mounting on picture hooks don't always hold up to the task. Due to the irregular surface on the back of ceramic tiles, the foam padding is needed to provide the thickness and to allow for irregularities in the surface.As a rule, you should use about a half inch of this tape per ounce of weight. I used 5.5 inches for the ceramic tile, and the bond is as strong as would ever be needed. The package says that it holds up to 2 lbs, which presumably refers to the maximum weight of each object to be mounted. The roll is long enough to support a total of over nine pounds worth of items. Sixty 4 by 6 photographs weigh about nine ounces, so this roll can go a long way.The tape itself comes in a roll with no dispenser and with a single backing strip between layers. Therefore, you can't pre-cut a section and hold onto it for later. But you can cut off the amount you need, apply it to an object, and leave the backing layer in place until you are ready to mount your object.There's nothing new or innovative about this product, but this product is very well suited to its task. It can also be used for a wider variety of tasks, but it might be best to save it for those special tasks for which it outshines other solutions. Although it can replace anything from thumbtacks to picture hooks, thumbtacks are cheaper and this product might be overkill.
