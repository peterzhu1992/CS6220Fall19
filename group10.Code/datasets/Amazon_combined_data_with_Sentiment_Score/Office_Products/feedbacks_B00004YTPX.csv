Use em far more often than I use my Parkers (which I also love)",5,What's NOT to like about Bic?,1275868800,"06 7, 2010",0.745

I'm sure every one has used normal bic pens before, they are exactly the same as the one you normally used. I personally don't mind using them, I live with a few people in my house and my pens tend to get lost quite often. They normal everyday pens.",3,They are normal pens,1252454400,"09 9, 2009",0.1101

They go through a lot of pens - customers take them, bussers toss them, they drop them, etc. This package, as an 'add-on' item, cost under 10 cents per pen so I ordered two and took them in. BIC pens are pretty reliable for taking orders and are cheap enough they don't mind putting them down with credit card receipts.",4,Good cheap pens,1354752000,"12 6, 2012",0.2885

5,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,B00004YTPX,csm,"[4, 7]","I think we've all used these pens for thousands of years, or so it seems! This is usually one product on which you can count, to not leak all over the place and still write nicely, and for a long time. However, I noticed that they're now made in Mexico. Why on earth? Bic, you need to come back home to make these. Other than that, highly recommend!",5,Great pen!,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",0.1797
6,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B00004YTPX,D. Blankenship,"[16, 19]","Indeed, as another reviewer has stated, these pens have been around for almost ever. There of course is a reason for this...actually several reasons. First they are quite inexpensive. Second, they actually write. Third they are available anywhere. Forth, they do no leak. They last quite a long time. And finally, they are not unpleasant to write with.I substitute teach which means I can be in a 3rd grade class one day and in an advanced high school class the next...I never know. I carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff. I always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably, sure as the sun rises, there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil (I always keep several packages of pencils too...but that is for another review). I have also noted that some classes and some students will actually try to take advantage of a substitute teacher and their third favorite request the instant the bell rings is can I go to my locker...I forgot my pen. Ha...I have the little twerps! And I don't even have to be mean about it like I do with the endless bathroom and drink requests.Anyway, these pens work great. They do not leak all over the place and smudge. If the student forgets to return the pen...which often happens, I am not out a lot of money and they are less likely to steal them as they do not really look all that cool nor do they have a lot of whistles and bells on them.As an additional advantage, I do not mind writing short notes with them myself, and I am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk. I have found that even I have trouble loosing these things if I buy them a dozen at a time. Anyway, they write smoothly and get the job done.Like another reviewer here, I am not all that happy about these not being manufactured in this country anymore and think it is a shame...but what are you going to do? I guess it is worth it if we can make the fat cats fatter. I will note that when the company changed the manufacturing location, to save money I presume, I certainly did not see the price of these things, cheap though they may be, going down any, for us, the consumer.Be that as it may, I certainly can recommend these things. They do what they were meant to do.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,THESE GET THE JOB I BUY THEM FOR DONE.,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",0.1541
7,A1UFLVSJ3IRETQ,B00004YTPX,Eric Aderhold,"[2, 2]","What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable. They have a plain, cylindrical body, a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap, and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within. They won't win any beauty contests, but they do put ink on paper, and they do it cheaply. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly. Other than that, these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat.",4,They write. They're cheap.,1278547200,"07 8, 2010",-0.0667

When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do, I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use. I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars!

I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design. It says white barrel in the description, but I hoped to get this new color. Luckily I did. The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside, and it looks more interesting than the traditional white. But, I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it. It still feels about the same as the old barrels.They write the same as always, too. Not as good as the Cristal pens, but decent. The Cristal pens have a wider point or something, even though these are both labeled as medium points. If you want a basic blue ballpoint, this is it.",4,Basic Bic Pens,1255132800,"10 10, 2009",0.2431
