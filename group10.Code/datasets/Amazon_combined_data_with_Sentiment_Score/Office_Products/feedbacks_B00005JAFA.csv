In my case, this has been a good incentive to think twice before I go to print anything. Now, this set is a true price break from what I was used to. I don't really need an 8-pack but I did get one once, by mistake and I had no problem with the i950, I just ended up with 2 extra cartridges.It's low price, free shipping... if this was a grocery item, I'd probably set it up as an Amazon subscription. If anyone is aware of a better deal anywhere - it's got to be genuine Canon ink - please leave a comment to this review and I will be more than grateful.",5,"Probably the best deal around, if your printer needs an 8-pack",1235865600,"03 1, 2009",0.4226

On Amazon, even if you filter for new only and manufacturer only, it brings up used cartridges from unknown manufacturers.Used cartridges are really not good for your printer and you never know exactly what you'll get (unless you have your own cartridges refilled). Now if you still want to use them, that's up to you.My issue is that you really have to pay attention to make sure you are getting new and sealed manufacturer cartridges when you are buying online.

10,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,B00005JAFA,"Gadgester No Time, No Money","[5, 6]","Well, the other guys are all complaining about Amazon's shipping charge. Amazon's free shipping for over $25 offer comes and goes, so if you see it in effect -- it is as of today (10/12/2005) -- grab whatever you need. As for buying the ink tanks, just buy all three colors in the set at the same time to qualify.Anyway, let me talk about the ink tanks themselves. The three BCI-6 ink tanks work in the Canon Pixma iP3000 printer. (Maybe in other models as well, but I have the iP3000.) These are official Canon ink tanks so you'll know they'll work well. The number of prints you get heavily depends on your printing habit, e.g., what you print, how much you print, and at what quality you print.Using my usage as an example. I print at Normal Quality most of the time, and I print about 50% photos (at 200 or 300 dpi, depending on needs) and 50% web pages (e.g., flight confirmations, Hotmail messages, etc.). I don't print Word text documents much. I've run through 2 sets of ink tanks, and my very rough estimate is each set has lasted about 250-300 8.5x11 sheets. Maybe more, but I don't wish to raise your expectations too much. Suffice it to say that of all the inkjet printers I've owned -- photo or not -- the iP3000 has a terrific ink capacity record. Of course, if you use one color more than the others, that particular ink tank (or ink tank combinations) will go out faster.(For your reference, a few months ago I read in a magazine review the the average per letter-size print cost of the iP3000 came out to around 12 cents per page on plain paper, one of the lowest average costs for inkjets. Not sure what settings they used in their tests or how much they paid for ink tanks, though.)In case you are interested... the new Canon iP4200 model employs a new formula of ink which supposedly will not fade for at least 30 years. My own take is, no matter how you print your photos -- even at professional photo labs -- a photo print will eventually fade if exposed to light. It's just a simple law of chemistry. So be sure to archive your digital photos on CDs or DVDs so 30 or 40 years from now, you can still print fresh copies and relive your treasured memories in their full colors.",5,"A real review, not complaint about shipping charge",1128988800,"10 11, 2005",0.0851
11,A1EKSETIBS9ETQ,B00005JAFA,,"[0, 0]","Well this is canon own ink so the quaility is top notch and I have great photo printouts. My beef with this ink type is that it dry too quickly and canon printers waste too much ink when you turn it on and off, it does it cleaning or something. I don't use myCanon i960 Photo Printerthat often, when I do use it for black and white, I get low ink all the time. Sometime I only use black printout and the other color inks are out. I spent too much money here on Canon fast dry-up wasting ink compare toOriginal HP 56 Black Ink Cartridge in Retail Packagingand and old Epson that I could refill the ink/color. There is no chip on the ink, but I got a newCanon PIXMA MP560 Wireless Inkjet All-In-One Photo Printer (3747B002)that does use an ink with chip like HP.So you get good quality but Canon makes their money off the ink that dryout too fast when not used.
