My only gripe, and why it's 4 stars, is that the box that it came in doesn't clasp fully closed. I'm not sure how to explain this - the clasp is molded plastic, two little nubs. One of the nubs is missing. Still holds together alright, but I wouldn't want to shake it around or drop it on non-carpeted floor or anything. It came like this. Obviously is broke somewhere along the way and wasn't designed like this.Not sure what else to say about push pins. Except, doesn't it always seem like push pins are things you know you have around until you actually need them, and then you realize that you don't have any anywhere? They're like safety pins in that way.Anyway. Good push pins. Meh container.",4,They're push-pins.,1349827200,"10 10, 2012",0.0874
