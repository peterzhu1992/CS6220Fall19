1,A2UTU1T0P7YTSG,B00004Z64O,"[4, 5]","DYMO brand labels are more expensive than generic labels. A lot more expensive sometimes. However, I burned through 2 DYMO label printers with inferior generic brand labels. They got the machine jammed up and caused the entire machine to burn out and fail. Generic labels caused me a big headache and lost money and time. I still like my DYMO printer, but I learned my lesson the hard way. Spend the extra money on DYMO brand labels. Yes, they are probably charging a little too much, but it is what is. The labels are high quality and won't ruin your printer.",5,Warning: Do Not Use Generic Labels.

A little bit of sun and heat and the thermal paper blacks out.Now, their clear labels are a whole other story...I love them!! These allow a more professional look on envelopes, packages, and return mailer cards.Buy the clear labels - you will fall in love with how quick and easy they are to use.",3,Love Dymo Labels!,1205625600,"03 16, 2008",Barbara Bell,0.6885
