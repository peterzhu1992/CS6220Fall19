It is plain vanilla - there is no picture of cute kittens or puppies but it does the job at a very reasonable price. I recommend it to budget-minded Amazon shoppers.,5,Plain vanilla but does the job,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",0.1997
7,AFXTKAO0CB354,B00004Z59A,C. Weaver,"[0, 0]","I've used many different typs of mouse pads with many different kinds on surfaces and I've always liked the one color darker type cloth pads. The pads with patterns and things printed on them can cause a problem with some laser mice and I've run into that many times. The back surface is great and the thing I liked best was it wasn't to thick. Some pads have a really thick rubber base and that tends to raise the pad a bit to high for me. I have my mouse pad holder mounted to the left side of my KB on a center desk drawer and this pad nicely covers the whole surface and isn't to thick as my old one was. The darker color seems to have helped my tracking too. I've ordered two more of these, one for another computer's mouse and a spare. Really like this pad!",5,Just What I've Been Looking For....,1351641600,"10 31, 2012",0.2295
8,ABDR6IJ93HFIO,B00004Z59A,Daisy Daisy S,"[1, 1]","For me, I tried this very nice quality Blue Belkin Standard Mouse Pad and was happily surprised. This mouse pad works well with any type of mouse I tried and any brand of mouse I tried! First, I tried the MS Wireless Mouse and the mouse moved so well over this pad. Then I tried out my new Verbatim Mini Mouse (the retractable type). The Verbatim mouse moved very well over this pad. In addition, the back of this mouse pad is coated and stays in place (no slipping on my desk--it stays nicely in place).Looking for a very good quality and basic mouse pad that works without paying a high cost? Look no further, this is the mouse pad I suggest to you. And I believe that you will be very happy with it.Highly recommend this Belkin Mouse Pad!",5,Basic Blue Mouse Pad - Works Well With ALL TYPE OF MOUSE!,1383868800,"11 8, 2013",0.3896

18,A6FIAB28IS79,B00004Z59A,Samuel Chell,"[0, 0]","This is a very ordinary mousepad, though the Belkin name at least assures you of decent quality for a mundane yet necessary item. It replaces a dirty, ink-stained, slightly smaller red mouse pad. My 5-star rating includes considerations of pricing and packaging along with Belkin quality. I've received similar pads that were all rolled up and misshapen so that they would fit into cheap packaging and require less postage. But as a Prime product, this two dollar mouse pad, rest assured, will arrive in a full and firm cardboard box. No unfolding, pressing, or ironing required before you're able to use it without agitation. The pad, moreover, is sealed in a Belkin cellophane wrap, making it a nice, inexpensive gift for a friend or associate on an otherwise overcast day.",5,Meets all expectations.,1316995200,"09 26, 2011",0.2085
