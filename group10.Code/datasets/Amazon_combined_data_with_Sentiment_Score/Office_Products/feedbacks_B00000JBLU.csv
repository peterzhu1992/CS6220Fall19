0,A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B00000JBLU,Comdet,"[3, 3]","This is a well-designed, simple calculator that handles typical four-function math. Large, easy to read display that includes a comma to help ensure long strings are easier to read. The buttons are slightly sculpted which helps ensure you don't hit more than one at a time, and are nicely spaced. The display angles up and is legible in even somewhat dim lighting.Seems well-built - better than I expected given the price. Excellent choice if you're looking for a small desktop or hand-held calculator.My only complaint is that you can't clear the memory unless you display it. That seems to be the way with all calculators today. A shame -- I have a very old one that allows you to clear memory without displaying the number (e.g., has separate buttons for clear memory and display memory). That comes in handy at times.",5,"Nice design, works well, great value",1291680000,"12 7, 2010",0.2998

Large easy to read keys with a nice feel, not too hard - not too soft. Large easy to read display. All in all, good calculator for everyday basic functions.",5,Great basic calculator,1184025600,"07 10, 2007",0.3816

However, if you need a handy sized, easy to read, solar calculator...this is a good one. It does everything that I want a calculator to do at work. It can figure %. I never use these features, but it can figure tax rates and has memory (mrc, m-, m+). The buttons are big enough. I would buy this model again.",5,Perfect,1216080000,"07 15, 2008",0.1111
4,AGBFIQMV9L61Y,B00000JBLU,Ladybug,"[0, 0]","A great, basic calculator that does exactly what I need it to. It is a bit bigger than I'd like, but I've become used to it. I actually kind of like the bigger buttons now. I also like that it has a no-slide bottom (i.e., it stays in place when I am punching numbers at the table). Overall, a great purchase!",5,Great basic calculator.,1315699200,"09 11, 2011",0.4265
5,A2R6RA8FRBS608,B00000JBLU,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[6, 6]","Texas Instruments makes an excellent, relatively basic calculator with all the functions I need. The unit is sturdy; this is well made.In addition to solid construction, there are quite a few calculator functions that should suffice unless you need a scientific calculator or another more advanced model. The keys are good sized; and this makes using them to calculate things very easy. You can expect this product to reliably add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers; and you get square root, percentage, a change sign key (to change from a negative number to a positive number), and three memory function keys as well. Great! I also like that the display uses commas when necessary.There are three more function keys at the top of the buttons that read (rate, tax+, tax-); they are for calculating tax rates.Although this is a solar powered calculator (you can also use it under a light), it can be used with batteries as an option. There is a battery compartment on the back of the calculator but rest assured you don't need to use it; solar power or using this on a desk with a lamp will make a battery unnecessary.Overall, this is an excellent little calculator without the bells and whistles I just don't need. I highly recommend this item.",5,all right by me !!!,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",0.5916
6,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00000JBLU,Patricia A Reader,"[14, 17]","This review is for the SECOND version of this calculator, the slightly-larger, grey, BLACK and white model, with a rounded mound housing the keypad. I had actually ordered the older model -- the light-grey model, with the blue and white keys, slightly smaller, which I had had previously, but sadly lost. I had considered returning this newer model, but finally decided against it, as it is now listed as being discontinued by the manufacturer, so -- if I returned the newer one I did get, I very well might have gotten the same model back..........I was, at first, extremely disappointed in the newer model. (Why both the newer model and the older model -- which look COMPLETELY DIFFERENT -- have the VERY SAME MODEL NUMBER is completely beyond me. I mean, people who work at Texas Instruments are supposed to be very intelligent and know what they are doing....but why they decided to give to truly different calculators the same model number is something I don't think I'll ever understand. I mean...what kind of genuis makes this very simple mistake? (one who wants to fool online and catalogue buyers, who have to trust that the packers will pack the right model, perhaps>)That said, this NEWER model -- though larger and more-than-slightly bulkier than the older one -- does have a few advantages....I think.I don't remember the older model having a tax+ or tax- or rate key, nor do I remember it having a battery backup, as the newer model does.This newer model has a nice little compartment for the battery, which need only be opened with a single screw. So, the entire back of the calculator need not be taken off -- with the slight dangers, therein, of getting dust into the machine, or disturbing the delicate circuitry, in the half a minute or so, that it takes to change the battery. With a neat little separate oompartment for the battery changing, the rest of the back of the machine need not be disturbed at all!This is all the more important, as more and more calculators, sadly, are made with no user-replaceable batteries enclosed, (no -- one is instructed, in these other, still newer calculators, to take them to the nearest authorized repair shop, of the designated manufacturer -- and have them replaced there, like wrist-watch batteries! First wrist-watches, now calculators! Talk about planned obsolence! (Buy even this newer model 1795SV, and keep it close!)Although the newer model 1795sv has a wrap-around, windshield numberical display, (instead of what is to me, the far more esthetically pleasing and clearer, picture-frame numberical display, found in the older model 1795sv), the numbers still are well-spaced and clear to view. It also has the nice, l a r g e numberic display, which is not only on this newer model 1795SV, but also on the older model 1795SV.....and also on the belated, dearly loved, and sadly lost original Texas Instrument 1795 model, (no sv), which I once had, and enjoyed more than both of the 1795sv models put together! (It was small, handy, and a beautiful medium-bone-yellow in colour. It also seemed to stay on FOREVER -- pr at least an hour or so, if I remember correctly. Oh, that Texas Instruments would bring THAT model back, sigh!)Well, this NEW m0del 1795SV -- though NOT the older, handier model 1795SV, nor the original model 1795 -- still has many good points, most of which are delineated above. It is also a desk-top model which can be carried in a pocket-book, if necessary -- and also in a briefcase, but not in a wallet. It is bigger than the two previous models in the Texas Instrument 1795 line...but does have that priceless customer-replacable battery chamber. Although I do prefer the previous two models, this newer one, now available, is not a bad little calculator, all things considered.But I would still welcome, (greatly!), the return of the original 1795 model, and/or the original 1795sv.",4,W O R T H....A....S E C O N D....L O O K....A N D...

The numbers are large enough to see. And has never given me a false answer or calculation like other ones I have had.It has a solart cell so you do not have to be concerned with battery failure. As your desl lamp or outside window light will keep it charged for you. Large led numbers are easy to read if your eye sight is not what it used to be.Purchased here on Amazon.com Where the whole World.
