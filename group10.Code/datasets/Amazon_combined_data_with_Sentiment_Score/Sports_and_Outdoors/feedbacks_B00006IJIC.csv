I kept one at home and one at work (I work with middle school students at a summer camp/program) and both broke but regardless I still love this thing. Mine at least have been pretty easy to aim as it is pretty consistent. It is a little tough to pull but shouldn't be a problem for anyone older than 8. In high school one of my teachers had one just to shoot students who were falling asleep. Pure fun for any age! I think their average life is about a year and then the &#34;bag&#34; starts to rip. Assembly was quick and easy, it's just a fun product.",4,Pure fun except they aren't too durable,1360886400,"02 15, 2013",0.4154

It shoots a bullet of air that is strong enough to catch any unsuspecting soul off-guard.Initially saw one in use at DollyWood; one of their magicians used it in his act, and it was hilarious.It makes a bit of a &#34;pop&#34; (thats obvious) when you pull back to shoot it, but if you're in an area where unsuspecting folks are its too funny not to use.Safe, fun, easy to assemble, kids and adults will enjoy.",5,Oh my word...,1381795200,"10 15, 2013",0.6913

When it starts getting boring I put it away for a week or two then shoot the dog with it. Since he can't see it coming he things something just jumped in front or above him! I even hit my mother in law several times and she had no idea the &#34;thump&#34; was what was causing her hair to jump!!!!! This is even fun for my 4 year old, she can pull it back enough to get a nice air slug out even though she can't pull it back all the way and still aim. Great fun!!!!!!!!!!",5,After several months I'm still having fun with this.,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",0.0619

It was a really fun way for them to fight each other, and have a war WITHOUT anyone or anything getting broken or injured. Even the adults seem to love shooting it at each other. But if you're worried about messing up your hair I wouldn't recommend getting shot.. It really does shoot a blast of air.. nothing to forceful.. but will mess up your do!",5,The teenagers love this!,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",-0.1033
7,A17BUUBOU0598B,B00006IJIC,"Mark Technology, Music and Movies","[5, 10]","The AirZooka may be a *little bit* of fun for a very young child, but overall it's a pretty disappointing toy. I have to wonder if the people who seem to have had a great experience with this toy actually were able to purchase one pre-assembled. That's because once all the pieces are together, this toy may hold the interest of some kids. But putting this toy together reveals how poorly designed and fragile it is. And personally I really didn't see the point once we did get it assembled.One of my nephews received a pair of these on Christmas Eve. Good thing he got a pair because only one survived. I, and several of my cousins, undertook the rather embarrassing endeavor of trying, and failing to correctly assemble these. It quickly turned into a joke along the lines of how many engineers does it take to assemble a simple children's toy.The unit is made of three concentric rings, as you can see from the product picture, that must be extended before you can attach the handle and a sight. The two attachments are kind of shaped like christmas trees, but have some small tabs that are supposed to attach to the rings. These tabs are VERY fragile and be warned, if you break one of the 4 there is virutally no way to attach the handle. And without the handle, it's impossible to use this toy for what it's meant to be used. The three rings collapse into themselves if you try to just hold onto them and pull the air bag without the handle attached.Somehow we were able to at least get one of these put together. The pay-off was very anti-climactic for me. There's a plastic bag inside the AirZooka that you can pull on and release to shoot a concentrated gust of air. I suppose if you caught somebody off guard it might be funny. But how long can that joke be re-used? My nephew seemed to enjoy it OK, but after 15 minutes had moved on to his other toys. Considering three of us messed with this thing for 30 minutes to get it to work, the pay-off just didn't seem worth it. I also have to wonder how safe this toy is. If that rubber band were to break free, I could see the bag and pully being launched at somebody.I am surprised that others seemed to love this toy. To me, the poor quality was strike one. While some kids will find sneaking up on people with this to be fun for a little while, this also seems like a one-trick pony. For me that joke would get old fast.If you haven't removed yours from the box yet, exchange it for something else. And if you are considering this, I definitely do not recommend it at any price.Good luck.",2,AirZooka Air Gun - Big Disappointment,1230163200,"12 25, 2008",0.1502
8,A1QNYLBG73QRNF,B00006IJIC,Neurasthenic neurasthenic,"[1, 1]","One of my nephews just turned 9 and I got him this Airzooka as a gift. He seemed disappointed upon seeing the box, expecting something electronic I think. Once it was assembled though, and demonstrated to him, he was delighted. The air blast coming from the Airzooka carries a surprising distance, and the target feels for an instant as though he's been hit by something very soft. But there's nothing but a targeted gust of air, making this a much friendlier toy than a gun that shoots actual projectiles. I personally was charmed by the fact that this remarkable effect is generated without use of any batteries. The design is ingenious.Some reviews here have complained about the difficulty of assembling the airzooka. I found that assembly was easy, but the instructions were bad. At one point, they call for rotating the barrel of the gun, which I first took to mean rotating the lower part of the telescoping barrel relative to the upper parts. That isn't what they mean, and in fact they could just have said extend the telescoping barrel all the way and saved the confusion. Assembly takes one wide-tip screwdriver (I actually used a narrow chisel), and took about five minutes.The only bad news about this toy, from my point of view, is that it is loud. Parents are typically going to want to restrict it to outdoor use as a result.I plan to buy a second Airzooka next month for another nephew; they are going to love having air wars with each other.",5,"I love this, as did my nieces and nephews. A great non-battery toy.",1342396800,"07 16, 2012",-0.0286
