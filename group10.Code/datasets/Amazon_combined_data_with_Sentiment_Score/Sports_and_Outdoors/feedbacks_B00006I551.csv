Stop watch,date,light etc....Seems like water proof very durable and battery lasts forever.Tried other watch but they were bulky , heavy, battery life is crappy, bands dont last a year.I had all different expensive watches but they died on me with all different reasons.This is the only watch that still running.",5,"Cheap, thin, very functional.",1358208000,"01 15, 2013",-0.4461
2,A1UL25PU5ULVBJ,B00006I551,hbthemik,"[12, 13]","I needed an everyday digital watch that I can wear to classes and gym. This one does the job very well at its kind price (can find at a cheaper price online) and looks good as well. It stays very comfortable on my wrist due to its thin and small face. I have a relatively thin wrist (Sz 6.5) so it looks proportional. I can see how this one can look a little small if you have a thick wrist but worth a try anyway. It even looked a little small on my wrist at first but I became to like the look of it as time passed.I also just switched battery on mine since the lcd looked a little weak. It's extremely easy to change the battery too. Just unscrew the 4 bolts on the back, take out the watch inside (it's one piece), open it by opening four corners, swap the battery, then put it back together. Even if you have no experience with battery changing on a watch, you will figure out easily.Overall, I'm very satisfied.The only con if I have to pick one - the light could be a little brighter. But no problem reading the time.",5,F-91W,1278288000,"07 5, 2010",0.2671
3,A21XUDC9QBLLSI,B00006I551,jlundin,"[0, 0]","I think Casio under prices this watch. I have purchased watches from Nike and some of the other expensive brands and this Casio is still my favorite. The low profile makes it wearable every day. It says it is water resistant, but I have gone to the lake and swimming with this watch and never had any water issues. The back light is not as bright as some other brands but I am glad it is not because this helps the battery last longer and it is bright enough to see it. The watch is very user friendly for first timers. You can not beat a watch like this, especially when it is a quarter of the price of other watches.",5,Best watch I have ever purchased,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",0.2841

8,A1S6713X0SUBZS,B00006I551,Midwest Al,"[2, 2]",I use the watch often and it functions well. The band is a thin flimsy plastic BUT strong enough that it hasn't broken on several work activities. I have worn in the pouring rain and had it on when it was -5 F...and still works well. I paid about $10 and I would consider getting it again!,4,Recommend it...,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",0.2696
