0,ASGL4FBI6GZW0,B00004TQ2P,B. D. Brault,"[4, 6]","Like other reviewers I am absolutely enamored with this little ball. But two flaws stood out right away. The first is that ball came 3/4 inflated. I had to dig out the bicycle pump to inflate the ball. Not a hard job, but one I didn't suspect I would need to do. The second issue was the synthetic material covering and the Made in China stamp. I find it hard call this a replica ball when it's not made of leather nor made in the USA. That all said, the ball is really cute. We tossed it around the yard today. I got it specifically for my 2 year old son. He is infatuated with my official NFL game ball. Now that he has his own, fit for his small hands, he is so very happy. As I write this review, he is upstairs sleeping with it tucked in bed with him.",4,Absolute Fun!,1352505600,"11 10, 2012",0.1502
