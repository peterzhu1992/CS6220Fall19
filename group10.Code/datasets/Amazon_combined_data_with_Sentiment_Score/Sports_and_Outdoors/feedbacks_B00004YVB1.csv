0,ACNYR79WI3K1K,B00004YVB1,Amazon Customer,"[5, 5]","This is my initial review. I will update this after using it in Afghanistan.BLUF: I would buy another one should something happen to this one right now and would recommend it to a friend. I have used two other brands of multitools extensively for the last 13 years and this product is more solid and feels better made. Each tool can be extended without pulling out other tools and does so smoothly yet firmly enough not to feel cheap or to come out when you pull the tool next to it out. The tensioner on the back of each handle is very finely cut to produce an individual tensioner for each tool. The tools themselves are very general purpose and don't seem to be designed for any particular trade or use. The pivot pin of the pliers is smooth, has no spring or tension to it, nor any lateral/sideways movement. The case fits well and doesn't slide around much at all on my 2 utility belt. The tool arrived well oiled appearing to have been cared for until packaged for distribution.My overall initial impression is this tool strikes a good balance of tension and smoothness to provide a quality tool suitable for general purpose work. It would certainly suffice until more appropriate tools were on hand. I will edit this review after the tool has loosened up and I have had a chance to use and sharpen all of the tools. (Update 1: The carry pouch for the tool closes via a button which I have not been able to master. It takes some finesse to close properly and if it is hit just right it will open unknowingly. I've recently replaced it with an old multi-tool case that has a velcro closure because I fly helicopters with the doors off. The case itself is the sturdiest of the four nylon cases I have owned in the past and the closure suffices for day to day uses, but if you do work where the tool could fall out if the button were not snapped, I would either look at getting a different case or know you will have to modify the existing one. I have downgraded my review from a 5/5 to a 4/5 because I believe the people that use a multi-tool like this on a daily basis are probably performing a job that would require a more secure closure; however, if I were to rate the tool itself, I would rate it 5/5.)",4,Quality General Purpose Multitool,1313193600,"08 13, 2011",0.1807

In my opinion, Victorinox Swisstool X beat all others I have in quality and functionality. The selection of tools is perfect to perform all tasks I face in home or outdoor. The tool is very well made and the finish is perfect. The tools have individual locking mechanisms and all tools lock in position. All tools are also easy to access.The pliers are bold and strong.

That pliers are not needle nose but I like the compromise. The stout but slightly rounded nose is precise enough for most precision jobs but because the metal is of softer material I can understand why they don't included it. The craftsmanship on this tool is top notch and better than any other multitool I ever had. What more can I say, it's a victorinox!",5,Best of the best!!!,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",0.4256
4,AQ55H30MZSV0Q,B00004YVB1,John A. Lefcourte,"[0, 0]","This is a beautifully constructed, solid tool. Being so it is on the heavy side. The only faults that I find with it are: the phillips head screwdriver blade is hard to remove and there are three slot head screwdriver blades. In this day and age it is rare to find a slot headed screw and rarer still to need three different blades. On the other hand, the one phillips headed screw driver is of an in-between size (size 1?), a larger or smaller one would be more useful. I have found that it works fairly well with larger Phillips head screws.The locking mechanism for the blades is positive and easy to remove.I agree that the snap closure on the holster is inadequate.If the combination that includes three flat screw driver blades works for you then this tool is nearly perfect.",4,Beautifully made,1293408000,"12 27, 2010",0.2778

Its a little heavy....but its a larger mult-tool andso is pretty much on par with its competitors as far as weight.I think the price tag is acceptable, as this thing will last youa lifetime.I know there are a lot of leatherman fans out there that will tell youleatherman is the only way to go and is American made!Thats all nice and good....but I would advise you just get out there andplay with a few of these...like I said, you will feel the quality of the swiss-toolover the leatherman.

6,A1R4830GBU8UIM,B00004YVB1,LgT,"[1, 1]","This one has all the tools I was looking for - sturdy pliers, scissors, sharp plain edge blade, file, saw, and the all-important awl which seems to be a hard to find feature these days. I own several Leathermans, and I can't stand how their tools clump together and are difficult to deploy. The Swisstool has no such problems. Every tool is easy to deploy individually, and locks in place. Also important is that the tools can be deployed without having to open the pliers. The product has good fit and finish, is reasonably comfortable to hold, and has no sharp edges poking my hand where they shouldn't. The included holster holds the tool securely, I didn't observe the problem of it opening too easily as mentioned elsewhere.",5,Excellent multitool,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",0.2547

9,AA8YKC2LOYDN2,B00004YVB1,Richard G. Life is Good !,"[1, 1]","I owe Wave and Vic.X tool as I found them to be the best of the best on the market among multitools. Recently I bought Leatherman TTi Charge(the most expensive one) and pliers broke with first hard squeeze... that was unacceptable for me and I returned it. I owe first Wave and X tool for 4 years now and will say that for more delicate job you probably would want Leatherman Wave but for the tough job (any job)- X tool is 100% the leader. Just look ahead of time and decide where, and how, you will most likely use your knives. The best future for me over Wave is quality of steel. I didn't see anything of the same or better steel quality in other knives yet.

10,A23PRGE14NPEDK,B00004YVB1,Saint Richard,"[31, 34]","The Swisstool comes in three configurations, which another reviewer has described well. The X model had the combination of ingredients that seemed to fit my needs best. Everything about the Swisstool shows that Victorinox was incredibly serious about offering a top quality product.I have had experience with several multi-tools (check my other reviews) and the Swisstool MUST BE a contender for the best. There are some top of the line tools that I have never used or even handled, of course, so I can't say absolutely what tool is THE best but the Swisstool X has to be considered one of the very best mulitools available.I can't help but make a comparison between the X and L-Man's Charge TTi (which I also own and rate as a 5).1. Both these designs exude class. The X has a beautiful high luster polish to it. The fit and finish factors are all first class. On the other hand, the TTi's Titanium scales give it an elegant look and also offer an improved grip.2. I like to access my tools without unfolding the pliers. The TTi allows this kind of access to the tools I use MOST. But the X allows access to ALL its tools from outside (except the pliers, of course).3. The TTi allows you to access two knife blades and unfold the pliers with one hand - maybe useful in emergencies - which the X does not. Some have complained that the tools on the X are stiff and hard to access. I recommend using a thumbnail rather than a fingernail for this but it isn't a complaint that I - personally - consider a major drawback.4. The Knife Blade: I am reserving judgment on this. The TTi has two blades and the X just one (which is the configuration I chose to buy) so I will compare the one blade. Each is straight edged, no serrations (which I prefer) and about the same length (larger than the blades on other multitools I have owned). I like the shape of the X's blade better (a spear point, as opposed to the clip style blade of the TTi). On the other hand, the TTi's blade is S30V steel (premium stuff) whereas the X's is of top quality stainless (my guess is 12C27, or something very similar). I will see how often I have to resharpen the X's top quality stainless blade. If the edge holds up well, it may turn out I like the X's knife blade better. But for now, like I said, I am reserving judgment.5. The pliers, etc. on each of these tools seem quite good but I have to give the edge to the TTi, which has a true needlenose design. They should therefore be a bit more versatile than the X's pliers, which are a blunted needlenose design.6. Screwdrivers, etc.: Even without the TTi's included bit driver kit (something similar is available for the X, also) the TTi gets an edge over the X. The TTi's eyeglass screwdriver is definitely superior to that little wedgie at the end of the X's can opener, which will not be able to reach into narrow places (sorry).7. Both tools have solid, easily accessed and worry free locks for all tools, a necessary safety feature - as anyone who has had a tool fold up on them can tell you.8. I have no concerns in the area of durability and ruggedness for either tool. I have had the TTi a while now and have done things with it that SHOULD have broken it - but didn't. It still looks and feels like it did new. The X seems to be at least as solid in its construction as the TTi and Victorinox has a reputation to uphold, so there are no worries here.The bottom line is that I am really pleased with both of these tools. If I lost either one, I could live happily a long time with the other. If I lost both, I would probably buy the X as my replacement (considering the considerable price difference) even though I probably like the TTi just a little better (this week, anyway).In any case, Victorinox has a winner in the Swisstool X. I can't imagine how anyone could rate it as less than a 5.",5,Yup. For Sure a Five. This is a reference quality tool,1218153600,"08 8, 2008",0.3425
