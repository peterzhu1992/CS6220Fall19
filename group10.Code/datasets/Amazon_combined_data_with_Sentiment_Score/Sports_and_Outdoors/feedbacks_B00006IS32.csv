I had a single mantle Coleman years ago but the ex wife got it. I burned regular unleaded gas in that one years ago and it wasn't recommended, but it worked fine and never had a problem with it. I'll burn good old regular unleaded in this too.",5,Very Nice,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",,0.2284
1,A5G7B65K0UKOT,B00006IS32,"[1, 1]","These Coleman lanterns are incredible values. I've had this model for 20 years or more. As a kid, my family had a similar model that is still going strong. There isn't anything advanced about these; no electronics, no batteries. They just work. I have to replace the mantles about every 7-8 years, usually because I bumped the lantern too hard and one or both mantles broke. At only a few dollars for two mantles, it's no big deal.You would need several high-powered LED lights to equal just one of these lanterns for light output. On high, this will light up your entire camp site.I can't speak to the issues some have had where they say that their units appeared to be used. As long as you get a new unit, you cannot go wrong with this lantern. You'll be passing it on to your kids or grandkids.",5,A Must-have For Any Camper,1375142400,"07 30, 2013",Bob,0.0289

3,A1MLF8GEG3HKFZ,B00006IS32,"[5, 6]","I absolutely love this lantern, so much in fact that I plan on buying another one.This is my first gas powered lantern, so I read the instructions carefully on how to light this. Box says it is 1107 Lumens, with 7 hours run time.First, you need to burn in the mantles with a match before lighting, this was quick and easily done, there is a YouTube video out there to show you how to do this if you need help, it helped me out and was easy.I only use Coleman fuel because I have read enough reviews that say unleaded gasoline will shorten the life of the generator, and even the instruction manual will tell you this also.I filled it up, pumped it about 30-35 times, and lit it with a match. It lit up right away, it kind of dims and brightens repeatedly for about a minute, but this is normal for for the first minute for the generator to warm up. And WOW, I was amazed at how bright this is!We used it camping the following weekend, and I can easily say out of a packed campground with 49 camp sites, we had the brightest lantern by far! I just set it on the picnic table at night and it easily grabbed everyone's attention who drove by because of how bright it is! The kids loved it, as it easily lit up the campsite to safely navigate and not have to worry about tripping over anything or stepping on something, not to mention it gives them a sense of safety of not being scared of the dark.I had this burning on max output for about 4 hours before we went to bed, and the amount of fuel it consumed was barely noticeable. I have a feeling a full tank of fuel could make this last a lot longer than what the instructions say!SUMMARY: On a side note, this isn't a lantern to be used inside a tent or camper, due to the fire danger and the inhalation of gases, but using it outside it is flawless, I can't say enough how much I love it! It is Made in the USA, so that's obviously a plus. The quality seems great to excellent. I believe this thing will last a very long time with light normal use and being taken care of.

5,A2M2522FFM497K,B00006IS32,"[10, 12]","This full-sized lantern is a good choice for a shelter-in-place (SIP) scenario or campsite. Backpackers or people walking to a bug out location (BOL) will probably want the much smaller/lighter eXponent lantern.This lantern lights easily and is quite bright. I find the lighting holes acommodate the long grill lighters if you get the lighter angled up-down enought. Remember that using Coleman fuel instead of unleaded will extend the life of the generator. Use of unleaded exclusively may be a false economy, depending the price of (non-gasohol) unleaded and generators in your neck of the words. Coleman fuel will also be considerably less stinky while running and particularly when starting and shutting off.The lantern does not come with a case but you can make one out of a pickle bucket. Line the inside with larger bubblewrap to absorb shock. There will be enough space inside for your long lighter, spare mantles, funnel/filler etc.",4,Good emergency preparation lantern,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",FraterMus FraterMus,0.0946
6,A23TT1WKYB0OS9,B00006IS32,"[1, 2]","I wrote some pretty scathing reviews on the dual fuel gas stoves, but I gotta tell you...this lantern is real nice. It casts a nostalgic amber hue across the campsite, unlike the bright, in your face LEDs that are so common. Keep the LEDs inside the tent, where they belong, this lamp is made to be outdoors and it is incredibly efficient. We burned it for four hours each night for 2 nights and I still had almost half a tank of coleman fuel left. Meanwhile, my neighbor was scrambling for D-cell batteries, LOL. Is a bit unusual to prepare the mantles and light the fire in this day of point and click, but, take a moment and relish the (sometimes) greatness of simplicity...this product gets the job done.

You can use Colman fuel or unleaded gasoline (the Colman fuel burns brighter) I bought this to replace the one I had for 30 years. The old one didn't berak someone stole it or I would still have it for years. This lantern is very similar, it is a little easier to operate and my old one was green.

11,A24IOF8IXC4WEH,B00006IS32,"[2, 5]","It is an OK lantern that provides light at night. I did not try it out using unleaded gasoline, so I am going to assume it works OK using it (We used Coleman Fuel for it.) It is not too heavy to carry around, although it is way too heavy to hang on their very own Coleman Packaway Deluxe Camp Kitchen as the pole sways way too much. It was easy to setup and the included mantles worked great.The big issue on the one I received was that the adjustment knob was too sensitive to adjust the intensity to anything other than Off, Low, or High. There was no way to adjust it anywhere in between.",3,It Provides Light,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",P. Anderson AgentAnderson,0.1599

It was super bright, burned all night long with no problems and was so quiet. I was thinking it was going to be loud and hiss like the lanterns I was used to having when we were kids camping.....nothing like those. They were great too by the way but this one was the real deal. I would recommend buying the case to bring and carry your lantern because the glass globe is fragile if not stored and carried properly. The case that was recommended by Amazon for this lantern fit the lantern just right and was perfect for storing it in. We packed all of our camping supplies in the back of our truck and no harm came to the lantern at all in the storage case!!
