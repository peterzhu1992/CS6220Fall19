1,A3MNMPRLQBSS5J,B00005BV0D,LifeIsGood,"[0, 0]","Our Jack Russell Terrier/Dachshund mix loves to play frisbee and we haven't found any frisbee she likes but this one. We've tried many different dog frisbees, and she doesn't like any of them - unfortunately, because they hold up to her chewing a whole lot better than this one!!! So we have to buy her a new Aerobie ever 3 or 4 months, but she just LOVES this thing. She quivers all over when we bring it out and she can hardly contain her excitement. This frisbee goes fast and far, but she is a little speed demon chasing it. Although it wasn't made for dog use and can't stand up to her teeth for as long as we would like, it is worth every penny because it brings her so much joy. I ordered some 13&#34; Aerobies by mistake last time, and although they were bigger than she is and would trip her up when she was carrying them, she still loves them. These are excellent flying frisbees for humans, too, by the way!!!!",5,the best Frisbee we've ever used1 Just ask our dog!,1396051200,"03 29, 2014",0.3675
2,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B00005BV0D,Noname,"[1, 1]","I found the Aerobie at our campsite. It have to say, it was a prize! What a wonderful flying disk. I'm not very good a Frisbee, and I never would have bought this, but my daughter and I were throwing it around and it's nearly impossible to throw incorrectly. It will always fly -- sometimes, too far (I don't know my own strength). It makes me want to go to a big park and see just how far it will go. My daughter is seven and she can throw it just as well as I can. Yes, this is much better than a Frisbee -- easy to throw, easy to catch. I'm bringing this to all my outdoor functions.",5,Absolutely the best flying disk,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",0.2948

4,A11DZ2YIN018N,B00005BV0D,Slycooper,"[3, 3]",I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw. This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro.The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use. Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan.It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually.,3,Great Fun But Care Must Be Taken,1367712000,"05 5, 2013",-0.1819
