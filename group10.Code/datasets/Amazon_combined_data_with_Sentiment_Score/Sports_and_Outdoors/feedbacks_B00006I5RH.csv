0,A1U5H73RS0AY73,B00006I5RH,C. Fuller,"[0, 0]",The initial ink that came in my pen was crap. This writes at any angle on almost anything and doesn't streak.,5,Awsome,1389052800,"01 7, 2014",-0.1909
1,A3PRF6LJFSDU57,B00006I5RH,Garry L.,"[0, 0]","Wow! Really does all that they claim! I highly recommend this pen refill. Can be used all by itself, right out of the package in a pinch.",5,GREAT PRODUCT AND GOOD PRICE,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",0.261
2,A2VQLV2GUC4H8J,B00006I5RH,Hal in Augusta hrosser,"[3, 3]","I got tired of ball pens that skip a little when you first start writing, so I got this and it works just as expected. First time, wet or dry - upside down or horizontal.",5,It fits a Parker pen just fine,1355616000,"12 16, 2012",-0.2202
3,A5XST67MB560Y,B00006I5RH,Joe Just a dad,"[0, 0]",The pen is great. It fits in that little pocket of your jeans. I was never really sure what the purpose of that little pocket was until I got my spacepen. Now I know. Refill lasts me almost a year and I use it daily for quick notes and sometimes meeting minutes.,5,Great pen,1302652800,"04 13, 2011",0.0667
4,A1WKN122IOCAD7,B00006I5RH,JohnnyT,"[3, 5]","Everyone covets my space pen when I whip it out of my pocket. Some even try to steal it. When they try, I stab them in the eye with it. Needless to say, that's why I need a replacement refill.",5,It's a OEM refill for the best pen in the world,1293235200,"12 25, 2010",-0.27
5,A3SFYX4G856XIO,B00006I5RH,John Ping,"[0, 0]","The original pressurized refill. This comes with a small cap on the back to take it up to the size of standard Parker refills. I'm currently using it in a Karas Kustoms Retrakt pen body, and absolutely adore the combination.",5,Good pressurized refill,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",0.3128
6,A370EIEIJD139O,B00006I5RH,John T. Kooz Validate Your Life,"[2, 2]","I only use the spacepen. this ink (the medium, the fine point I'd give 2 stars but the medium ink lasts forever). This ONE pen is all i need for non keyboard writing materials really. It's durable; i've had it everywhere. incredible.",5,The Best Pen In the World,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",0.0205
7,ABD6TPKC6ADF4,B00006I5RH,Mehri Kaufman Mimish,"[5, 5]","I've carried a small (4) extend-able sized fisher pen for about 15 years. The ink starts rolling smoothly w/o any smudges. There is a review saying they smudge w/ water, but my papers don't usually come in contact w/ water, so I don't know.... I notice w/ the parker pen that the first word has a big glob-- that's never the case w/ these.",5,Lasts about a year... No smudge,1272153600,"04 25, 2010",0.0
8,A1AIGBCU2HW850,B00006I5RH,Michael Reardon,"[0, 0]",I have used these in my Parker pens for years. They work in the freezing weather the desert heat and the Florida Everglades. Sure they take a little break and to write smoothly but once they're going they keep going for a long time. If you need to write upside down on wet paper and keep your notes permanently look no further than this refill.,5,Still The best!!,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",-0.0583
9,A1E9BNKOSRIYCB,B00006I5RH,Prepper10 DTOM LFOD MALONE LABE,"[0, 0]","If you like pens that don't write well on many surfaces, or when you're lying down, or when it's cold, or whatever, then you'll hate this refill. But, if you're one of those who demand that their pen work all the time, every time, without question, then you've found what you're looking for.",5,Only cartridge I ever use,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",-0.4709
10,A2RTJXBBXZJY7U,B00006I5RH,Robert D. Estrella,"[0, 0]",This is a perfect fit for the Fisher Space Pen for about half the price that you would pay if you went to their website and ordered one. RDE,5,Perfectly Fits The Fisher Space Pen for half the price!,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",0.3502
11,A1WWQB10TA1JGX,B00006I5RH,T. P. Davis timmy,"[1, 2]","This fine point seems scratchy, it may just be the one I got, but this one doesn't flow like the standard medium point.",3,A Bit Scratchy Fine Point,1386201600,"12 5, 2013",-0.3105
12,A27EE7X7L29UMU,B00006I5RH,ZapNZs,"[0, 0]","This is an old, old cartridge and, by modern standards, is outdated. Yet I keep going back to it and makers like Benchmade have made it the refill of choice for their pens (my personal favorite and I have many). Why? It gets the job done.I love how rollerballs write. Smooth, easy, and some now use ink that doesn't smear much at all. But you can't write on an angle or upside down...sounds silly, right? I agree...except when you need to write something on an angle or upside down, it is usually important information as otherwise you wouldnt be doing it. Having a pen not be able to finish the last few digits of that phone number you are writing on a pad of paper you are holding to the wall with your knee is...infuriating...especially given it is probably an important number. So the pressured Fisher cartridges make a big win here.For a ballpoint, these are smooth. Some rollerballs are smoother (the famous G2 arguably is (great smoothness)), but at the expense of smearing and mini-breaks in terms of the continuity of ink. So it's a trade off. Which do you like? I use both...between a Space Pen and a G2, you can write on anything.In terms of extreme heat or cold, these do better than most. For most people, that probably is not an issue, but still a nice addition.In terms of longevity, these really outlast the thin refills. At six bucks, they should...if you are tired of going through Cross refills at a rabid rate, these will last 3-4x longer.But where these shine the most is something Fisher themselves do not advertise for reasons I will never understand. The impact resistance is exceptional. Multiple drops of a heavier pen directly on the point will not cause a change in ink flow. Most other pens will start releasing more or less ink to a point in which it becomes a nuisance to useless. While writing in outer space is something I will never experience, my incredible lack of coordination means dropping pens is something I am a master of. These are really impressive.So is this the best refill made? Not necessarily, as great as it may be. Your application will determine what is best. Today's market is characterized by high-performance writing instruments at a cost that is incredibly low...gel, ink, ballpoint, rollerball, and experimental pens all offer different features and one person may fall in love with one more than the others. Luckily, this Fisher refill is not very expensive relative to other refills and so IMHO it is worth buying one to see what you like.",5,I keep going back to it,1368057600,"05 9, 2013",0.2272
