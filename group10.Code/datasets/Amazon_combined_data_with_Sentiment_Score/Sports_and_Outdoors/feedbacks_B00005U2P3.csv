They boys have been playing with this ball outside all over the neighborhood for weeks now and the grip is still great and the ball is still inflated.Worth it.,4,Great Grip,1342569600,"07 18, 2012",0.719
1,A1HBC0NBQJHT7X,B00005U2P3,Bookphile,"[0, 0]","My daughter had been in desperate need of a basketball for her outdoor hoop, so we decided to give this one a try. The surface has a good, slightly textured feel that was a little bit tacky, which made for a nice contrast to the cheaper rubber basketball she'd previously been using, which had been worn nearly smooth.We've had the basketball for some time, and it's survived nicely in our garage over the course of the change of seasons. Unlike a lot of the other sports balls we have, this one holds air well. It has a good bounce, and the surface is still in good shape after all this time. Being bounced against the cement on our driveway hasn't left it any worse for the wear. I can't say how it might function in an actual court, but it's a good choice for some outdoor basketball.",4,Good for outdoor use,1365120000,"04 5, 2013",0.2728

It feels great out of the package the tack on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- , could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ , Holds air wellFeel - B+, more tacky than other basketballs, but feels greatBounce - B, GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- , I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses.

Using the ball mainly on indoor courts, it holds up well. I'm doutbful that the texture could withstand a lot of use on an outdoor court, but after a few uses outside, it is still in perfect condition.I like this ball a lot, but I only gave it 4 stars, because I noticed that whenever we pick the game ball for our pickup games, everyone shies away from these balls.",4,Very tacky (in a good way) basketball,1343088000,"07 24, 2012",0.3914

While it's the standard size for a basketball, the softness is very nice, especially when playing with little children. They seem to be able to handle this ball a bit better than the harder basketball that we own. It's quite easy to palm this ball compared to our other ball as well. The color is a rich, dark orange and quite a bit darker than the standard ball.

6,A1DY0CRKZEY0FB,B00005U2P3,J. Perkins,"[0, 0]","The main feature of this ball is a tacky surface that makes the ball easier to grip. This feature works really well. This ball has a noticeably better grip than the Wilson indoor/outdoor ball that I have been using for casual driveway basketball. Otherwise, it is a typical indoor/outdoor ball. It is well made and keeps inflated. One interesting fact about this tacky ball is that when wet it becomes much slicker than a standard ball, which grips about the same when playing on a wet driveway.",4,"Nice ball for casual, everyday play",1347926400,"09 18, 2012",0.3674
7,A2V2URLB31HG59,B00005U2P3,JT,"[0, 0]","If you play outdoor hoops, this is a good value for less than $25. I never bring an expensive ball to outdoor pickup games - harsh on the ball plus decent chance of forgetting your ball or someone getting it mixed up with theirs and walking off with it.Upon shipment arrival my new Spalding Tack 29.5 did need some air but I've found that to be typical plus if you own a basketball you should expect to need a ball pump once in awhile. I'm partial to tacky (sticky) balls because I just seem to shoot better with them (better rotation since I can't palm a ball) - this Spalding was right up my alley with the stickiness factor. Nice dribble, nice feel - actually the best sub-$25 I have used and probably my future choice for outdoor ball.Now of course I've only used this ball for less than one month and only a few times per week so I can't comment on the durability yet (will update review if anything notable) but so far the ball is holding up nicely - I've found that I don't get more than 6 months use out of regularly played outdoor ball anyway.So overall, 5 stars thumbs up for value.",5,Good ball for under $25,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",0.5302

I have 2 boys that lllooovvvvee basketball and this ball is their favorite. This ball emulates the feel of leather, that also offers the durability need for mixed surface use. It seems like they had ball handlers and shooters in mind when making this ball. The ball has a wide channel design, suitable for indoors or outdoors use, the ball meets official NBA size and weight requirements.

Otherwise, the ball will start to split at the seams if left out in the sun.This ball would have gotten the coveted 5 star rating but the price is a little high compared to similar balls out there.

It's sturdy and has a good hand feel right out of the box.Even though it did get smooth really quickly when used outdoors, (losing that nice 'tacky' feel), it wasn't unexpected or really a big deal considering the low price of the ball.It's a good value and has held up to daily games without much visible wear and tear.All in all I'm happy with it and would order it again!",5,Shoots and scores!,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",0.7754

Does what you would expect from a new basket ball. This ball is marked for indoor/outdoor play. But the tacky surface feels artificial and won't last long outdoors. It will lose the grippiness after picking up too much dirt and dust and the it will feel worn out.

He already had 3 previous balls he plays with. But when he saw this one he said 'yep, that's pro quality' with a long smile. The grip is so good, the response is up there also.

As a family we have played with this basketball at the court club we belong too (indoors) and so far so good. The tact is still just fine although if and when that changes I will update my review. We have used this basketball everyday since we've gotten it and its still as inflated as the day I got it.I will also mention that the ball doesn't have much protection inside its shipping box so I recommend using caution when opening the box so you don't end up slicing the ball.This particular basketball overall seems to be a great value based on the selling price, I would recommend this ball for beginners and intermediate players alike!",4,Shootin some bball,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",0.6739

This ball is a tack soft basketball, a shooter's ball, with a good finger grip.Of course, when I tried it, all my shots went in. Let's face it, at age 53 I can still shoot. Heck, I tried a ten pound medicine ball and made three straight 3-pointers. But my son liked the feel, and enjoyed shooting, and seems to make more shots.Seriously, this is a gym rat's ball, not a street rat's ball, and it does give a good feel for a shooter.Heck, I could make a watermelon from 20 feet 11 out of 9 times.

Regulation size (29.5). Being soft, it's not Spalding's most durable outdoor ball--the Street model may be more durable if you play outdoors all the time, and the tack on this one does wear off after a couple of dozen hours on cement. Indoors, it'll last forever and stay nice and grippy. It needed a little air when I received it, but otherwise, I'm totally satisfied with it.

Change can be hard, and I sometimes want to stick with the traditional grip. However I have to admit that it is nice to be able to grip the ball better. I also need to evaluate how well this ball will handle usage. I play mostly outside which can cause more wear and tear on the ball than indoor courts. This is probably the most important factor for me, and I'll try to come back and edit my review over time. I am also still evaluating how the ball behaves around the rim. So far I haven't seen too much difference in that regard -- I'm trying not to blame the ball for my misses. :) The ball has kept its air well note. I'd say that if you are on the fence with this ball, just go ahead and drop the few dollars and try it out yourself.",4,Good -- thus far,1342656000,"07 19, 2012",0.2132

That being said it is an excellent quality ball with very deep seems and a perfect gripping surface.4/5 stars for us - my only real complaint is that it is priced quite high.

We bought one similar maybe the exact one before but he didn't write his name on it and it never came back home after a practice.
