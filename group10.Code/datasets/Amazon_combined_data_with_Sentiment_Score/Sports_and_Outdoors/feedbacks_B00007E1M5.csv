I believe that the K-bar is one of the best functional knives I have ever owned, so for me to be surprised with this SOG is amazing. It was razor sharp out of the box. The handle is easy to use with gloves on in the cold, and the handle is not hard to use without gloves, the non slop surface provides for an excellent grip even when wet. This is a very functional knife and if I lived in an area where it was moist or constantly wet and rainy there is no doubt that this knife would be my first choice to carry. I bought the knife as a backup but and am not disappointed with it. I would recommend the SOG to a friend. This knife will replace the K-bar for fishing around the lake and from the boat because I can use a lanyard with it to prevent loss of the knife in the water. I like the nylon sheath because it will dry quickly if wet. the only negative that I have found is the velcro knife retainer on the sheath. This should be a snap in my opinion because it is less noisy. I will use it for hunting in the Fall but do not expect any problems.Overall I believe the knife is a good value and will serve me well in the field. It is nice to find quality and value in the same package.",5,A great alternative,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",0.3288

2,A1M2T0J45TTE64,B00007E1M5,G. Powell,"[21, 28]","I gave it 4 stars because really for recreational scuba diving IMO, a 7inch blade is too long. The Shorter SEAL Pup is a better knife. That said, this is a pretty tough knife. Not as strong as the Strider WB or TAC 10/11, but still strong enough for recreational scuba divers. Those other knives are also way more expensive, like 3x this one. The sheath which isn't pictured here is very high tech. It holds the knife firmly, has lots of straps and loops for almost any carry position. So a better choice than those cheapy but flashy dive knives from US Divers.",4,Good Dive knife,1044489600,"02 6, 2003",0.2706

BUY A COLD STEEL GI OR LEATHERNECK KNIFE INSTEAD they are less price, made in USA and exceed the quality of this blade by lightyears. Its all advertising Crap. Every SEAL carries weapons of their choice! SEALS are not issued weapons, they chooze their own weapons they pick!",5,not USA made?,1345161600,"08 17, 2012",-0.1789

Pulled it out of the box and shaved my arm hair right off...so ya...pretty sharp edge from factory. It looks sleek & stealthyThis will be one of my camping knives. I go camping around lakes and beachs so getting it wet and working fish, battoning wood and such with this knife will not been an issue. Well balanced knife...feels natural in my hands...will take a pounding and keeps on ticking.Love the sheath...well made and I like that side pocket to store my firesteel and a mini knife sharpener.SOG...what more can I expect",5,Super - Solid - Sexy,1357862400,"01 11, 2013",0.3327

6,A1Q1OB903OU30J,B00007E1M5,The Real Deal,"[1, 1]","The SOG SEAL knife is a very good knife. The blade came with a decent edge on it. The sheath is very good quality. There is a plastic insert that the blade slides into. A couple things to mention...First, the knife is made in Taiwan. So if you want an American made knife skip this one. Second, the knife handle is a hard (Zytel). I don't know why, but I assumed the handle would have a little give to it. The checkering does help with the ability to grip the handle though. I'd like for the guard to be a little more prominent, just in case my hand ever slipped. The end of the tang meant for hammering won't help you out too much except for small things. It is only about a quarter inch thick. Overall this is a good knife that I would feel comfortable having with me in the field if I didn't have my KaBar.",4,Good knife,1355529600,"12 15, 2012",0.2197
7,A107ASYG6HHAM1,B00007E1M5,Twang Guy,"[1, 1]","One fixed-blade knife I own I have carried through woods and hills for about 700 miles. (I kept track.) I travel as light as I can and every ounce counts. Any other fixed-blade must deliver a lot a performance for its weight before I would even consider carrying it.I explain all this because the SOG Seal knife is one of the very few I would not hesitate to take with me on a long trip to the middle of nowhere.There are many reasons to buy a knife, I know, but performance is what I care about. How much muscle does it take to get a fixed-blade to cut, chop, slice and split? The SOG requires less effort to use than most other fixed blades I own, and the ones that can match it are heavier. Among blades of this length, the SOG Seal is the champ. None perform better.I attribute this largely to its thick-spined hollow-ground cross section. Compared to many knives, the SOG's edge is thinner. If you want a knife to sink into something, thinner goes in easier than thicker. If I had to pry apart masonry and steel doors after an apocalypse, maybe I'd choose something else. In the woods, however, I know it won't fail.I guess it was sharp enough out of the box, but that's something I never pay attention to because I will sharpen a knife the way I want it to be. With the SOG Seal's blade, it was easy to do.I chose this over the Elite, btw, because this has no rasp on the back. On my Seal Pup Elite, that rasp is pretty much useless except on green wood. I assume the Seal Team Elite rasp is no different.Some might say the SOG Seal's handle could be better, the cutting edge could be longer and a fine edge would be better than the serrations. All may be true, but none of those things diminish the exceptional amount of capability this knife offers.",5,Best fixed blade I own of its size,1372464000,"06 29, 2013",0.1689
