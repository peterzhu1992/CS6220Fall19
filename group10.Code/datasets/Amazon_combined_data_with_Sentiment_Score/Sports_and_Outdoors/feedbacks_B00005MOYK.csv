They fold down to a very slim size that fits well under our seats or in our trunk. We have had them for some time and the children are able to fold them up and open them up without extra help from mom and dad (always a plus).The one negative that I have found is that if you get the lever that is used to lock the scooter open (or closed) at all dirty it will jam and not open or shut very easily. A quick clean will fix this, but it is something to watch for.A small adult can easily use this with no difficulties.

Definitely make sure you purchase a helmet and pads along with this scooter if you have inexperienced little ones.One issue I did not like about Amazon is the constant price changing they do.

Sure, you can't fit two feet side by side on it, it doesn't have suspension of any kind, and the small wheels get hung up on sidewalk seams, but it gets you where you're going three times as fast, (it really -does- roll smoothly), it's -very- compact, and -very- inexpensive.

These scooters arrived at my Post office in less than a week at a overseas military address. Scooters were exactly as described. Adjustable height for the handle bars. Capable of folding up to a relatively small size for stowage, or travel. Why the 4 stars as opposed to 5? This is because the handle bar shaft fits somewhat loosely in the neck of the scooter. I would expect it to be of a tighter fit. Every Razor scooter I have ever seen or handled demonstrated this looseness in the neck.

28,A1TZCOXEFT8XP8,B00005MOYK,HuoXingC Ninja MidgetChan,"[2, 2]","I remember having a Razor A Kick Scooter about a decade ago when the original first came out, and it was pretty handy for traveling short distances (e.g. to/from school or neighbor's house) when a bike wasn't necessary. It was a fun, easy, and convenient to ride...until someone borrowed mine indefinitely. Now, as a college student, I wanted a scooter as a means of transportation to grab lunch and run errands off campus without the hassle of driving my car.I must say that this A Kick Scooter is just as awesome as the original I had a decade ago:+ looks pretty much the same+ conveniently folds up the same+ rides smoothly just as before+ no annoying wheelie bar+ different colors to choose from+ brakes on back wheelSimilarly, it still has the same problems as before:- the brakes don't slow the scooter down fast enough- the wheels are too small- no suspension- not designed for the bigger and heavier kidsNote that it's a very basic scooter offered at a very affordable price, so don't expect to use this for doing tricks. The fact that it folds is all ready a good enough reason not to take this to a skate park. Since it has no suspension, I would avoid riding this on bumpy and/or uneven grounds. Even as a small adult (4'11, 105 lbs), I feel as if I'm about to bounce right off the scooter whenever I'm going down a bumpy road or sidewalk. Also take note of the weight limit. It would definitely benefit from a suspension system and slightly bigger wheels, but at the same time, remember that this is a classic kid's toy. If you're an advanced scooter rider, and adult, or you're anywhere close to the weight limit or above it, I would recommend getting a different model that has a higher weight capacity, bigger wheels, and a suspension systemRazor Pro Model Scooter. My bf, who is 6' and about 180 lbs, can barely move my scooter. If you walk around a college campus and see a rather pudgy college kid riding one of these, you'll notice it's all ready squeaking for help.Overall, I recommend this specific model for kids and small adults for basic use.

Unfortunately, being a winter birthday she couldn't go outside and use it except for a couple days when the weather has gotten better(it's late March right now). However, she has been scooting around the house for the last few weeks and has gotten the hang of it pretty well. All the neighborhood kids already have these scooters so it'll be nice for her to race her friends!I'm giving it an OK rating because aside from assembly being super-simple(just unfold it and it 'clicks' in place) and looking like good quality(that's why I went with the Razor name instead of a cheaper alternative) it has already started loosening around the headtube. It's to the point where the front wheel can completely turn a different direction than the handlebar if you put the lightest pressure on it! I'm almost afraid to let her go outside now and use it on the sidewalks(she does have a matching Razor helmet which I always make her wear). It's only been used in the house for a few weeks and shouldn't fall apart like this!Unfortunately, I don't have a big enough wrench nor do I know what size headtube wrench to buy on Amazon.

If you're looking for the lightest scooter out there, this is it. This guy is priced very well and has a variety of color options. Most importantly, the aluminum construction is light and durable. This thing can fold up to a very sleek flat size that will probably fit in a larger gym bag.But because it is so sleek, the foot rest is rather thin. The handle bars are also somewhat light and narrow. So it's perfect for younger kids and kids who are lighter or have smaller hands and feet. But as your kids age, they will outgrow this.The wheels have ABEC-5 bearings, which any skater will tell you are capable of going relatively high speeds. Not to mention, it's so light this thing could pick up speed quickly. It's worth the time to train your kids on safety before you give this to them. Because of some of these features, they should not be going downhill at high speeds because the brake is not designed for stopping under those conditions.This guy is also missing a kickstand, but since it folds flat that's not a really big deal. The rear brake is also somewhat *bare bones* but once again probably perfect for the size.If you use this scooter right, it's probably the perfect starter. For kids up to 10 years old, this will probably be enough, but if your kids are older you should step up to one of the bigger and better models.I have been looking into a variety of the scooters on the market for the Christmas holiday, and so far I'm pretty impressed with theFuzion Asphalt Ultimate Carving Machine ScooterandFuzion Carbon 4 Wheeled Carving Scooter.

It says 5+, but I bought it for my almost 3 year-old daughter and while she isn't a pro at riding it, she LOVES being like the older kids and riding it. Especially if they are little, don't forget the helmets and pads because there WILL be some falls, but it's all part of growing up! With that said, the weight limit says 143 lbs so definitely not a scooter for an adult to ride around on. I've put all my weight on it (170lbs) and can move around on it, but would hurt the long-term durability, for sure. For $30, you can't beat the benefits of getting your kid outside and moving around! For adults, you can get one, too, to add to the fun for your young child. (get a bigger one like the Pro model $50).Scooter folds up for easy storage and can get slammed all around without damaging it..In short, it's kid proof!",5,Solid Scooter for little $$$,1326153600,"01 10, 2012",0.3881
