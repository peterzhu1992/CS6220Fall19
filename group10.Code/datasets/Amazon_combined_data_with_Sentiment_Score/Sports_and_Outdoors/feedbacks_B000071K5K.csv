I tried it and found it loud enough.Hopefully I will never have to use it to get help or rouse attention. I just feel better having one with me.",4,Safety measure,1389744000,"01 15, 2014",0.3536

I have another for bicycling in my CB hydration back pack.",5,very nice,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",0.1583
6,A2QTDL1XR2HTX,B000071K5K,Escape,"[3, 3]","I have been very pleased with my purchase of the Fox 40 Classic whistle. I mainly use these whistles while hiking or camping in the outdoors. Some of the features I like about it are...* 115 dB of sound- High pitched and designed to cut through other noises like crowds for coaches.Makes it seem very loud.* ABS plastic design- Free of Bisphenol A(BPA). The ABS plastic has proven very strong even in cold conditions* Pealess- No cork pea to collect moisture and germs. Does not lock up with excessive moisture. Makes cleaning easy.* Easy to clean- The whistle can be used in water etc, and it clears easily. Easy to rinse out and clean with some vinager and water or some anti-septic mouthwash. Especially useful after a camping trip with kids.* Variety of colors- You can find these whistles in just about every color, and even with favorite sport logos. I use the orange one most for visiblity purposes. But I also have a gold one which is actually tan.* Economical- The price point on these whistles allows me to have a few extras on lanyards around for each kid in the campsite. They are taught not to abuse them, and to blow them in three bursts if they should somehow get lost.A great whistle for search and rescue work, lifguards, coaches, hunters and hikers. Very versatile and strong. For everyday carry I would also recommendMicro WhistleorUltimate Survival Jetscream Whistle Ultimate Survivaldue to their flat designs and smaller profile. The Fox 40 classic is a great standard whistle meeting most needs.",4,Very Loud and Economical,1342137600,"07 13, 2012",0.3741

8,A1H2RD4UOB9FCZ,B000071K5K,J Bob Marsh,"[0, 0]",I've been carrying a flat pea-less whistle for a few years. Never was really satisfied with it's tone or volume even though it is Coast Guard approved. I bought this as a back-up but I like the tone and volume much better than the other one. This has been promoted to primary whistle.,5,Good piece of survival gear,1380672000,"10 2, 2013",0.3206
9,A1FW0WFZ5LVVCE,B000071K5K,J. Spencer,"[2, 2]",This whistle is extremely loud and has the sound of a real professional sports whistle. The pea-less design is great because you can dip it into water and not have to shake it out for it to work. This makes it ideal for emergency situations and outdoor activities. The plastic is solid and it's an all around great product.,5,Great Wistle,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",0.3939

11,A2AFGNABEUWPCS,B000071K5K,sghunter,"[0, 0]","I compared this to a standard whistle (the ones with the &#34;pea&#34; inside). This is louder, so in an emergency, this can be heard from farther away. However, it takes a lot more air to blow it. Therefore, if an emergency includes you being injured or weakened in some way, you might not get much sound out of it.My suggestion is to have one of these, but also have the traditional (easier to blow) whistle in your pack or emergency bag. If you have the energy to blow this, do so, if you can only blow the other one, even though it isn't as loud, it may still save your life.",4,"loud, but hard to blow",1383177600,"10 31, 2013",-0.0488

14,AURPR9F29QBWW,B000071K5K,TheColorBlindNebula,"[0, 0]","I used the Fox 40 Classic for many years as a lifeguard. You do need to be very &#34;deliberate&#34; when blowing the whistle, but once you get used to it, this shouldn't be an issue. If it's any indication of how loud this whistle is, I actually made my own ears ring many times because I blew too hard. I could also hear a coworker's whistle from almost a mile away over all the ambient noise. When I changed jobs and the lifeguards were given metal pea-type whistles to use (those are a joke, by the way), I continued to use a very old, very chewed up Fox 40. There's never a &#34;pea&#34; getting stuck in the chamber, and no part of the whistle itself can rust like a metal whistle. Also - because of the plastic construction, you can run this thing through the dishwasher without a problem. And, if I'm not mistaken, the Fox 40 will float if dropped in water. The only real 'con' is that you can actually chew the end right off if you use it enough. Even though my waterfront days are (mostly) behind me, I'm restocking my stash of Fox 40s for emergency use!",5,Wouldn't buy another whistle,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",0.0161

However, if you blow as hard as you can, you will find a marked increase in the volume and your ears will be ringing for a little while afterwards. Great, loud emergency whistle when used properly.",4,"Loud, but you have to blow really hard",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",0.0151
