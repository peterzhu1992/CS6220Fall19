0,ANABBW0ZDMRER,B00006IS67,Concrete Cal,"[0, 0]","First off let me say that this was the fastest shipping ever, period. And I just got the standard shipping.This knife is exactly what I wanted. While this is the most expensive SAK (Swiss Army Knife) I've ever bought, the quality is well in line with their other products. Blades are hair splitters right out of the box, the wood saw is just an accident waiting to happen, and the scissors and pliers are both tight. All this was expected.What I did not expect was the crispness of the cut on the file. While this file does appear to be the same steel as the other implements, in a pinch I have no doubt it will do some good work. The purchase of this knife has probably relegated my leatherman to permanent tool bench duty.Overall wonderful quality, fit, and polish.",5,Exactly what I wanted - really really fast.,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",0.1246
1,A36BYA9PJI5ZQM,B00006IS67,DZ1073,"[1, 1]","This is my third Victorinox Swiss Army knife. (I lost the first and still have the second. I only bought this because I wanted more tools). These knives are incredibly durable. I've never had one fail me. With some imagination, the tools can be used for many more things than their intended purpose. They are also much smaller and lighter than a Leatherman or similar tool, which makes them convenient to have on you at all times. They're perfect for those moments when an unexpected need arises and you don't have full size tools with you.",5,Can't imagine how I ever got by without one,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",0.0856
2,A28N1QVRF32RLQ,B00006IS67,gary,"[1, 1]","Swiss Army Knives (or more appropriately, Swiss Army multifunction tools) are among the best in the industry. My last one, just like this one, lasted about 10 years (with very heavy use), so I have no complaints, and it would have lasted longer if I would have stopped dropping it. I especially like the Craftsman because for me it has all the tools I use and like, and none that I don't (like the corkscrew). The pliers are small but useful, as are the scissors, but the saw blade is one of my favorites, as it cuts thick plastic or fiberglass and small tree limbs very well; and although I don't recommend it, I have cut a 2x4 in a bind. You can't go wrong with these as a tool. The construction is top-notch and the steel is excellent. The width of this knife is slightly more than it is tall, so it fits well in my pocket and doesn't spin. This is absolutely a great knife / tool.",5,"It's a Swiss Army Knife, What More Do You Need To Know?",1373500800,"07 11, 2013",0.511

4,AHOXK15HIY6KG,B00006IS67,tohearwell,"[0, 0]","I've had experience with Victorinox Swiss Army knives for over 40 years. My primary casual pocket knife has been the Swiss Army 'Mechanic' for over 20 of those years. I've always been satisfied with the quality, and with the fine edge you can achieve with the Victorinox stainless steel. This knife is no exception. Same fine quality. A little large to comfortably carry in my pocket, but a problem easily remedied with the available Victorinox Cordura Belt Pouch for Swiss Army Knives. Two of the most useful features of this knife are the scissors and the pliers. Of course you also have the available screwdrivers, as well as all the other features. It's amazing how handy this knife has been. There have been times, when I don't have the knife with me, that I find myself reaching for it to perform a certain task, and then, &#34;Drats, I wish I had it with me.&#34;",5,What else can be said - it's Victorinox,1383177600,"10 31, 2013",0.2803
5,A17V6IWPTMUXXY,B00006IS67,totallyfrozen,"[0, 0]","I know this isn't the biggest, most inclusive tool in Victorinox's line up but before you scrunch up your face and say, Dat ain't duh holy grail o' swiss army knibes!, just read my reasons.This tool has literally everything you need in a swiss army knife and none of the silly, gimmicks that you don't.It has all the tools I use regularly: screwdrivers, scissors, pliers, bladesAll the tools I use occasionally: awl, saws, filesA couple of tools that I use rarely: wood chisel, parcel hook (which should be renamed boot lacer since it's better used for tying/untying knots and lacing boots than carry tied parcels--which no one sends anymore)...and NONE of the tools that I never use on a pocket knife: corkscrew (truly ONLY Europeans would think this is a daily necessity); clock (watches and cellphones, thank you); miniature magnifying glass (if I'm trying to make something look bigger, why do I want a TINY magnifier?! I'd need a magnifier to see the magnifier!); flashlight (seriousy?! How can I use the tool when the light I need to see by is IN the tool?! I can look at what I want to cut OR I can cut it--but I can't do both at the same time!); hex drive w/bits (I'm just trying not to lose the toothpick, tweezers, or pin. I don't want to keep up with screwdriver bits!); fish descaler (Um...pretty much any knife blade can take scales off a fish besides, I don't want stinky fish scales in my swiss army knife)....and I could go on but you get the point.I consider this to be at the top limit of size and weight for pocket carry. Now, I wear cargo pants most often and jeans pretty frequently too unless I'm at work where I wear scrubs. I only wear slacks to church so I find carrying this Craftsman in my pocket to be no problem so far. It is only ONE layer thicker than the Victorinox-Swiss Army 53481 Deluxe Tinker Pocket Knife Knives, Swiss Army (which I also own) but you get FOUR more tools in it!If you're a desk jockey who wears slacks everyday, then you'll probably want to use a belt pouch like theVictorinox Leather Large Clip Pouch Swiss Army Knife Pouches Black 33256to carry this. I actually bought my Craftsman on eBay and it came with this leather pouch and free shipping for less than the price of the knife alone on this website. If you're a woman who carries a handbag, purse, or fanny pack everyday; you really have almost no excuse not to carry one of these because you'll hardly notice the weight at all. At 3-1/2 long, 1-1/8 tall, and 1-1/8 wide it's slightly larger than a lipstick or mascara; and at 5.6 oz it weighs less than 1/2 a pound! Ladies, it won't buy you flowers (but he doesn't do that anyway, does he), but it won't fight you for the TV remote either. Keep one of these in your purse and you'll only play the damsel in distress when you WANT to and not because you NEED to.The pliers on this knife are, of course, smaller than the pliers on my Leatherman Supertool; however, the Leatherman is heavy and bulky enough that you must carry it in a belt pouch. It doesn't lend itself to pocket carry (except in the pocket of a large coat). So I find that I don't really enjoy carrying my Leatherman. What good is a knife/tool if you don't have it when you need it? So I keep coming back to this Victorinox Craftsman.For the tool selection that you get for the size, weight, and price--this is truly the holy grail of Swiss Army Knives! Whether you're working around the house, out at the campsite, on the job, or trying to get your Land Rover fixed in the middle of the Kalahari Desert (OK, that last one might be a stretch)--I don't think you'll be disappointed in this knife! If you are, hmmm....I don't know...there's something wrong with you, I guess. LOL! (kidding!)This is just simply...THE HOLY GRAIL of Swiss Army Knives!Get it!(or you're a punk!)",5,Holy Grail of Swiss Army Knives!,1382400000,"10 22, 2013",0.1621
