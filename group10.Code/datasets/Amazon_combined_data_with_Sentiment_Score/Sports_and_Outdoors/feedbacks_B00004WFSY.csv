1,A2OEZIIK61GDW0,B00004WFSY,California Doug,"[0, 0]","Just the right diamond grit to be effective without taking off too much steel. Great for all-around use. The only drawback is the big handle flange, which I cut partly off with my bandsaw so it would fit in my knife block.",4,Diamond Sharp,1341792000,"07 9, 2012",0.3304
2,A2A8DBL1DOPOKH,B00004WFSY,Charles E,"[1, 2]","Had a Henckels International sharpening steel that came in a set with 6 or 7 other blades and a block. It never seemed to keep things sharp, and in fact, I swear it made some newly sharpened knives worse. Our son wants to be a chef and is currently a line cook, and when he saw our steel, he said it was so coarse that it was almost a joke. He tried to fix up our Henckels International knives with his own steel, but the knives were too far gone. I got the DMT diamond steel and it still has not done much with our Henckels International blades, made them better for sure, but has really ressurected som old Victorinox and Chicago Cutlery knives I took out of the basement. Also fixed up my swiss army knife and Columbia River Knife and Tool pocket knife blades. Worked so well I got a DMT serrated blade steel to go along with this item.",5,It really works.

3,A8VKEPW8YV7V3,B00004WFSY,H. Le TheInvestor,"[0, 0]",Just back and forward 5 or 6 times once every 2 or 3 weeks (depending usage) and it stays sharp. This is better than using the brick. After my research this product is worth the money and Amazon has the best price.,5,Work like a charm,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",0.4062

I still use my water stones from time to time but it's hard to beat the edge I get from DMT products. I bought two DMT diamond steels - Fine and Extra Fine.",5,Sharpening with DMT diamond grit tools - Excellent!,1368144000,"05 10, 2013",0.1998
5,AJNU8E5SHV6PQ,B00004WFSY,Manuel Antonio Arce Arenales MAAA,"[0, 0]","This sharpening instrument should be used alongside its brothers, the extra fine and the ceramic. Together they represent the best possible tools if the objective is to provide the sharpest possible edge on knives such as kitchen knives or large pocket knives. If properly taken care of, they should last a lifetime to boot. Use is not as easy as drag through carbide sharpeners, but it's not excessively difficult either. Very good instructional videos are provided by the manufacturer.",5,Simply the best sharpener for kitchen knives,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",0.3914
6,A1NW1NM5UB2I7C,B00004WFSY,nitro,"[1, 2]","4 month update!well after about 4 month it has completely lost it's sharpening ability. minding that i do a lot of cutting, and I used this on every knife around the house. However i was hopping that the diamond edge will hold longer. all an all i'm going to switch to sharpening stones.My Initial review:Sharpens the knives like never before! you need to know how to use a sharpening rod though ( plenty of youtube videos on it). rod usually alight the blade and not sharpen it though with this one you can sharpen the blade. works very well on a variety of steel grades.",2,simply works great.,1364428800,"03 28, 2013",0.1173
