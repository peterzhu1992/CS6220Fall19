I have brought other pairs of goggles from speedos to tyr and they all leak and fog up even when they say its anti fog and they do not seal well around my face. I aways buy aqua spheres now and no other brands of goggles. they are also easy to ajust. I would highly recamend these goggles to anyone they are great.",5,Aqua Sphere Goggles,1359590400,"01 31, 2013",0.1885

And if you have a 5 year old learning how to swim, it's quite frustrating and distracting for the kid and the parent. When it does work properly it's only temporary. Eventually the water sneaks itself back in the darn goggles. It really makes the learning experience for my kid very annoying if the goggle doesn't work. The adult versions are MUCH better. I'll just have my kid use mine instead. VERY disappointed in this product.",1,WATER goes in! Even when adjusted properly!,1392163200,"02 12, 2014",-0.1665

Your child gets a wider field of view, allowing them to see much more, especially for pool sports other than swimming.We've bought three pairs of these over the last four years. They would last longer, but they've gotten scratched in handling (not in use).Recommended, but we wish they didn't scratch.

They work well and keep the water out. Will be taking them to Hawaii next week to give them a proper test. Over all I'm satisfied enough to give them 5 stars.,5,These goggles hold up to there good reviews,1379635200,"09 20, 2013",0.2341

I know for me, nothing can be more frustrating than leaky goggles, so I'm sure it's the same for the kids. If you have never tried an Aqua Sphere product, adult or kids, you should. I have never had a leak, never had fogging issues, and they are comfortable for extended wear. I have had my set of tinted Aqua Sphere goggles for 3 years, and look forward to the same quality for the kids.",5,Excellent Quality...get what you pay for,1398124800,"04 22, 2014",0.1873

We tried many different kid's googles, which are either belt too tight or eye's shape too small.

13,A1MJZAV7WH0LC7,B00005LDW4,Life Adventurist,"[1, 1]","While we love the goggles (my boys aren't fans of the typical style) and they are amazingly easy to put on, we had one pair crack in numerous places around the seal after just one season of use. We do not abuse them, so I don't know how or why it occurred, but I did buy a pair to replace them. If the others crack I'll update!The sun-tinted goggles are perfect for my little guy with sun sensitive eyes. They fit my 4 year old (first wore them at 3) and 6 year old both well, I just need to make sure they are sealed before they jump into the pool.Updating a few months later - the sun-tinted goggles only lasted 4 months of weekly (twice a week in the summer). The last pair is barely hanging on and I'm guessing they will likely last a few more swim lessons before they start allowing water in. The seal has cracked on each pair of goggles, and I treat them the exact same way that I treat my own swim goggles that I've had for years.I do not recommend these goggles, I don't think they are worth buying a new pair this often. I haven't read other people's reviews lately, part of me wonders if there is something I'm not doing that they need that my own goggles don't?

15,A2JDUHUCHA17ZC,B00005LDW4,me-not-my-employer,"[0, 0]","Out of four or five sets of goggles and masks this was the instant favorite for my 6 year old son. It's a wide, comfortable, mask-like experience (without a nose cover) that avoids the problem of fit across the bridge of the nose. I expect they generate more resistence than competitive type goggles, but they're a heck of a lot more comfortable -- I'm looking for an adult-size pair for myself. The UV protection and smoke lens make solar-sensitive Daddy happy. Oh, and the kids haven't managed to get the straps out of whack yet, which is a small miracle.",5,New favorite,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",0.541
16,A2Q3WSU5PS2MZO,B00005LDW4,outwest,"[0, 0]","These are hands down the best kids goggles out there as they stay put on little faces. The large coverage area also seems to give kids more security in the water and also leaves less chances of them falling off. The material is tacky without being sticky, which is great for holding on to little kids in motion. The many colors are also nice so that each kid can have their own color. They aren't indestructible and the lens can scratch so a bit of care is a good idea, but as far as kids goggles go, this is a good investment to make.",5,BEST young kids goggles,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",0.5671
