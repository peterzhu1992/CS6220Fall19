5,AR0EX4KO0V21R,B0000531GV,kristine,"[0, 0]","I don't wear a lot of make-up.. just mascara and eyeliner so I didn't think I needed this but I got it just because i felt it i should since i do go to bed with that little make-up on and i keep reading and hearing its bad for the skin somehow. so yeah i got and its alright, it gets most of what i have on my eyes off, but not all ( i think i need one for waterproof) unless im doing it wrong idk. but yeah if you need a little make-up remover this works just fine. No itchiness, no irritation, no blurred vision (obvs don't rub it into your eyeballs) and i always rinse it off. its also convenient which is the No.1 thing for me. I love Maybelline so yeah, not bad",4,works for me,1372377600,"06 28, 2013",0.102
6,A3PI8OSXZ82Y6X,B0000531GV,Michael Flagler,"[0, 0]","My wife is writing this review for me: I have tried all different eye makeup removers, either they are greasy or don't remove enough eye makeup or leave mascara behind. This Maybelline remover works so very well, removes all of my makeup, doesn't leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind. It even removes waterproof mascara. I used Lancome for a while, and honestly, this works better and is so much less expensive. Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands.",4,Works so well and beats expensive brands,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",0.2088
