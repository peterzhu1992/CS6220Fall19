I used it on my body and my face, and didn't get the results I was hoping for at all. It wasn't the worst soap I've tried, but it's low on the list.",2,"Ok soap, not really worth the week I spent using it",1319846400,"10 29, 2011",0.0383

It's super hard to find, harmon drug has it but other than that you gotta buy it online but it works well. The key is to use a diffrent wash cloth for your acne area then the rest of your body so you dont spread the germs and oils that make acne worse, then ONLY twice a week or so use those scrub gloves (VERY GENTLY) to exfolitae the areas. If you rub too hard it can cause more acne. But this stuff works well on backacne so far.",5,CURES BACK AND BODY ACNE!!!!!,1352851200,"11 14, 2012",0.4179

4,AKUJI8ZQV6F2M,B000052YL1,Rachel,"[0, 0]",I truly love this soap. I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps that doesn't dry out or break out my skin. Would recommend to others. It smells soft as well,5,Soap,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",0.3577
