Cohn Crime Reader,"[2, 2]","I've been using this cream for about a month - almost every day - but I'm not convinced it's doing anything (it's ok purely as a moisturizer). I also don't like the smell - kind of gluey and unpleasant. I'll continue to use, because it's certainly not doing any harm, but I probably won't repurchase (unless my skin all of a sudden takes a sharp turn for the better).",3,Not convinced,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",0.0318

I use it along with a moisturizer each night. It tingles at times, but not to any extreme. It is not greasy or too heavy, but seems to last on my skin throughout the night. Happily, there is a notable difference in my skin! I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother. For the price, it is a bargain that lasts far longer than expensive products of a similar nature.

So after I cautiously use It, I will come back with a review...I just hope it does not mess with my very clear and flawless complexion.2 stars because I'm just not sure what product is in the container, and real Alpha Hydrox is great and I don't want to smear the Brand Name of this ProductAPRIL 10, 2013: Update; I have used the product purchased fromBeauty 4 you and I have not had any problems with the product. Alpha Hydrox has done what it has done for my complection in the past. However, I still suggest that one choose a reputable seller to purchase this product. Although, there are some very great stores on Amazon, one is always taking a chance purchasiang any product when stepping away from the Amazon Halo.Post Note: this product has really gone up in price, although $14.00 is still reasonable, it used to cost roughly $6.00 in the past, so watch for sales and deal breakers!...changed my stars to 5....Good Luck",5,Alpha Hydrox Enhanced Cream,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",0.5534
4,A1VPNNU07W851J,B000052YM3,Awesome,"[0, 0]","I've definitely noticed a difference after using this product - especially right out of show or after exfoliating. I have been using this product for about 2 months now, and have noticed more of a &#34;glow&#34; to my skin, and a reduction of fine lines. It does burn/sting when you first put it on, I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful, but you should be aware.Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes a LONG way, which is nice. A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly, so it's great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time. One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun.",5,Get Rid of Fine Lines,1355356800,"12 13, 2012",0.3905

7,A3JMSGSQJTRG9Y,B000052YM3,C. Slasor frisbeewife,"[19, 20]","I started using this creme about 6 weeks ago when I realized my 51-year old face needed more maintenance than it was getting. I'm a Florida native with blonde hair and fair skin, so after a lifetime of sun my face had issues with some sunspots and a blotchy complexion. I don't have problems with breakouts and only have a few faint laugh line wrinkles that I'm not worried about yet so this review won't address those issues.Since I can't afford constant facials I did some research and developed my own skin-care regimen. Exfoliating dead skin cells is important so I decided an AHA product would be useful and ordered this creme and began using it most nights after washing my face. I leave it on anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then use an eye cream and moisturizing lotion. I had some very mild tingling the first time I used it but nothing after that - if you have sensitive skin you might want to try the 8% version first and work your way up to the 10%.After doing this for about 6 weeks I can see a definite difference in my skin that can't be attributed to just the moisturizing. The sunspots are still there (and always will be) but they are much, much lighter and less noticeable. The blotchiness has evened out considerably and I feel like I could run up to the store without makeup and not worry about frightening small children. [...smile...] As I said, I don't have much in the way of wrinkles so I really haven't noticed whether this has done anything to clear them up or not. I doubt any skin product will do anything for serious wrinkles anyway, and if that's your worry you'll need to look into some kind of doctor or aesthetician's services.I highly recommend this product for anybody who wants to get serious about taking care of their skin.",5,I Love This Creme!!!,1217894400,"08 5, 2008",0.2749

Now they cost twice what they did then, understandable with inflation, but don't work worth a darn. Yet another epic fail. I am so disappointed in this product line. I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage.

11,AY8VC9FOS1WOK,B000052YM3,F. Fox,"[3, 4]",I am 45 and this stuff works. I have used a lot of different products since my teens. I have NEVER been disappointed with Alpha products. Simply they work. Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity (present company included). But these products work! I can testify to that. The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book.,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE",1362355200,"03 4, 2013",0.1253
12,A3PGY1E0PBTEVL,B000052YM3,ITalkBackToRiceCrispies SoThere,"[2, 3]","I absolutely love this stuff. They used to sell the 12% Alpha Hydrox cream at Walgreen's but they don't carry it anymore. I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is between 8% to 12% and the ideal pH is 3 to 4. You can use a pH test strip to check the pH. The Alpha Hydrox cream has a concentration of 10 and a pH of 4. The souffle works well too but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same. I've tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective. The higher the pH, the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless. I've been using this brand for years although I've occasionally tried others. I haven't found anything yet that does a better job for the price. It really does help keep the wrinkles away. I don't often reveal my age but when I do tell people I'm 55 years old, their jaws literally drop. Makes me feel great!",5,Tried and True,1351209600,"10 26, 2012",0.2974
13,A255S4FUADBMZ0,B000052YM3,Liz,"[0, 0]","This is a very cool product. I have dry skin, and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn't look good at all, especially with makeup. This creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher. It is not scented- it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell, but it's very faint, and you can't smell it on the skin (and I'm super sensitive to smells).It stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn't last more than 15 minutes. Also, the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little- that is a temporary effect too. I guess, this is how this stuff works- that must be some sort of cleansing process for the skin. Now that I've used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear, I can even skip the foundation, but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this. For daytime use, I apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is a must after this product, cause AHA is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB). For night use if my skin feels dry, I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn't contain AHAs).I'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, I don't have many, and I haven't used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.I definitely recommend this product, it's a great, truly effective creme, and you can't really beat the price!",5,"for thos who want clear, smooth skin!",1343433600,"07 28, 2012",0.2841

Since using this cream I have been able to wake and feel pretty good about walking around without using something to cover my blemishes. I have not had massive breakouts like I normally would and I feel like my skin has a touch of a glow to it now. I do not constantly run to a mirror to make sure my cover up is staying put. Will continue using this and most likely will repurchase when it gets low. Would order more now but it seems to be lasting well and I want to be sure it keeps doing good for my skin and isn't just a fluke! Will update if it stops working for me.Update: Still works great!
