0,A3DHS97DOBZDBW,B000052ZB1,Adriana V.,"[0, 0]","My skin is combination, tending towards oily. This daily moisturizer gives my skin the moisture it needs without causing more pimples and other blemishes. It leaves my skin silky soft and sinks in well after a shower - it doesn't sit on top of your skin like many moisturizers. For the roughest of winter months, however, I do need a supplemental moisturizer (I use German Nivea creme on top of this), but I have found this is a pretty reliable, year round moisturizer.",5,Fantastic!,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",0.2878

And as pointed out by another reviewer, SPF 25 would definitely be a better precaution than 15 but this moisturiser is so good otherwise I can overlook it for now. The main aspect of it that appeals to me is that the product actually stays on the skin and keeps moisturising all day. On a face as dry as mine is that is a rare accomplishment. Other creams bite the dust in a few hours on me.A reliable product that does what it claims to do at an especially good price.",5,"Got really, really dry skin?",1109808000,"03 3, 2005",0.2658

Excellent. Very neutral scent, with no unscented-chemical smell to annoy or interfere with colognes. As with all Neutrogena products, not a problem for my acne-prone skin.",5,excellent moisture that lasts but absorbs,1283385600,"09 2, 2010",0.064

In the case of this product it is SPF 15 - higher would have been better.Nonetheless, this is a nice hypo-allergenic formula that provides hydration for face and neck. It absorbs quickly so one doesn't have to wait to apply makeup.",4,MOISTURIZES AND PROTECTS FROM SUN,1076198400,"02 8, 2004",0.3107
4,A3N9TOPHBENB9I,B000052ZB1,S. Harrison,"[1, 1]","I tried this product while looking for a replacement for the Neutrogena Visibly Firm lotion that has now apparently been discontinued. I am NOT impressed. It reeks of that sunscreen smell and leaves my face feeling greasy for hours. It does not work well under makeup - the face ends up with a somewhat smeary look, similar to the look you get on a hot day when you've been sweating buckets. Additionally, it causes a very uncomfortable burning sensation if you get even the tiniest bit in an eye.I now only apply this product on my neck and d&eacute;colletage. While it does seem to work pretty well as a moisturizer, I will not be purchasing any more when the two-pack has been used up.Disappointing.",3,"Greasy, smells like sunscreen",1295049600,"01 15, 2011",-0.0401
