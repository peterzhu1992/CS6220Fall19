I use it morning & night in the winter, and at night in the summer, on my face and neck. It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area. One container lasts me forever! My brother even uses this in the winter when his skin gets so dry.This doesn't clog my acne-prone pores at all! And works wonders very quickly! (I like to think it also helps me avoid wrinkles!- I haven't gotten any yet!) This moisturizes without that greasy feeling some products can leave you with. I highly recommend this!1smileycat :-)",5,Just a dab will do ya!,1088467200,"06 29, 2004",0.12
1,A1K5DUV1L52MUD,B000052YQU,Bonnie Sayers autismfamily,"[6, 6]","Reasonably priced skin cream that can go on under makeup for daywear and apply liberally at night. I have been using this for years and it does softens skin in an extra rich texture that has a pleasing and recognizable scent.Since I am allergic to lanolin and have had sensitive skin my whole life I first checked the ingredients on the back of the jar and found this is not listed.There is also no sticky feeling left on your hands or face after applying and no tightness present on the face. It feels so silky when applied after I have come inside from a hot day, relief in a small jar that can be applied over face and throat. I have noticed a big difference in how my face looks since I first started using Pond's Dry Skin Cream.",5,The best and cheapest skin cream around!,1099785600,"11 7, 2004",0.1834
2,A16OCW6P50M874,B000052YQU,Erin Clark,"[0, 0]","I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process. Turning 30 is boring and hard. so far this has been a really, really great choice!! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent. I've tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing (I'm looking at you Lush) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.I will buy this again and continue to use it.",5,LOVE THIS!,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",0.1091
3,A2EFWH8N53TJX0,B000052YQU,Gabrielle Koczab drgabe,"[1, 2]",I bought this to replace the cetaphil moisturizer I was using and I am pleasantly surprised. I wish it had a better fragrance but it gives my skin the moisture it needs.,4,nice moisturizer,1372723200,"07 2, 2013",0.517

I usually buy it at Walmart because I can get the enormous jar for a pretty good price. I have always had pretty clear, dry skin so this moisturizer is perfect for me!",5,Perfect for me,1383696000,"11 6, 2013",0.7648
6,A26I2LD8QJ6ZP9,B000052YQU,Meagan S,"[0, 0]","I have extremely dry skin...if I scratch my face in certain areas, like around my nose, skin flakes off, it's so dry. So of course I've tried every kind of moisturizer out there. This has worked the best for me. You only need a littlebit, I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out. But it's definitely only for dry skin. Other people will say its greasy, but if your skin is truly dry like mine, It'll soak it right up and stay moisturized and it won't look greasy.",5,Finally a moisturizer that works!!,1403654400,"06 25, 2014",0.4234
7,ABAHRPQTOEP8L,B000052YQU,Patricia Manos,"[0, 0]",This would especially be good for winter months when it's cold and windy because it's a little heavier. Love the smell of it!,5,Very nice face cream!,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",0.5799
8,ALQGOMOY1F5X9,B000052YQU,scott,"[0, 0]",Great hydration without the breakouts. Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance. They need to make one fragrance free then I would rate it a 5 star.,4,ponds dry skin cream,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",0.3785
9,A2J22HT2NJC21T,B000052YQU,Tan S.W.,"[0, 0]",This is super effective in moisturizing dry spots. It might be a tiny bit too much for daily use on my combination/oily skin though. But I was in a desert for a vacation and came back with peeling skin on the sides of my nose and used expensive creams to no avail. 2 days with this and it was gone like magic. Recommended highly for dry skin. I just use the excess now on my body and it smells like baby powder.
