0,A1DDOISWL7HABL,B000052YJM,A. A.,"[5, 7]","I don't have severe huge white-head acne, but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere. I have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 (I am now 22). To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot. I am *that* sensitive. Hence, most of the Guaranteed products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).I don't know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin. My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if I itch form red spots, etc. I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I'm going to give it.To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox as needed. When I'm breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. So, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.As far as MOISTURIZER, I've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing' feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. If it simply felt like a 'masked' feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn't help the dryness at all.This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that's helped me. Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling! It's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. It has 0 oil. None. I leave it on for hours and it's perfect. The best thing is that it somehow doesn't irritate my capricious face. I was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim. For the first time in my life, I reached for the save.I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars. Very happy customer!",5,THE BEST!

I went to the dermatologist then and my dermatologist recommended this lotion along with a soap with Salicylic Acid in it to help keep my skin clear. I've used both now for 20+ years and I rarely have break outs.I have oily skin for the most part so I almost never experience any drying from this lotion and since I'm now in my forties, I use something else around my eyes and for my neck but this works great for my face. I use it after showering, allow it to sink into my skin for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a base, then foundation.This seems like it keeps my skin bright as well as clear so my complexion doesn't get dull and it doesn't add shiny-ness to my face. In the winter, I sometimes supplement this lotion with something a bit more moisturizing but this is my primary face lotion for the rest of the year. It doesn't make me greasy and leaves my skin soft. I don't know what I would do without it because I've tried switching to more expensive brands but either they don't work as well or eventually my skin begins to break out again.A bottle of this lasts me a long time too so it's very inexpensive to use. It's a must have in my beauty routine. So long as they keep making it, I'm going to keep buying.One last thing: If you get breakouts on your back or shoulders or chest, this works great for those areas as well. Apply it, let it soak in for 10-15 minutes then apply a good sunscreen if you're going to be out in the sun for any length of time.",5,Works Great on My Forty-Something Skin,1340582400,"06 25, 2012",0.351

The Target generic brand is AMAZING, I honestly would give it a 5/5! I have combination skin, so my face is oily in spots and dry in others. I use the product everyday at night, after I wash my face, before bed. I would like to think that the acne medication has the best time to absorb into my skin while I'm sleeping as opposed to wearing it outside in the sunlight, where it would make my face even dryer than normal. In the morning, I use a daytime moisturizer, but that is another review.I ended up buying the Wal-Mart brand because I left my original bottle at my mom's house. The Wal-Mart brand costs less than both the actual product and the Target brand, but is definitely of a lower quality. It's a lot more watered down than the Target version and takes several more applications to finally work. I still use it at night, however.I'm sure the real version of this product works AMAZINGLY WELL since I love the Target version so much.
