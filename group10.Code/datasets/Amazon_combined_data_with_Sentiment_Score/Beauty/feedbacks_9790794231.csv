I first discovered it when it was an insert in a magazine i was reading and i fell in love with it. i purchased it on amazon and received it shortly afterward. I really like this soft, flirty smell, but i didnt get nearly as many comments/ compliments on it as i do with my regular perfumes... kind of a bummer... but i still like the fragrance....",3,yummy soft smell,1255392000,"10 13, 2009",0.4641
1,A3R9H6OKZHHRJD,9790794231,LH422,"[0, 0]","This is a very unique scent! It's deep and mysterious and light and floral at the same time. The deep purple bottle is so fitting for the scent- it's dusky, smoky (it doesn't smell like smoke, but it gives off that vibe), with a hint of feminine innocence. This is a hard scent to describe, one that invokes images rather than particular notes. I've not smelled anything like this anywhere else.",4,intriguing,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",0.0104

I got this in the roll-on and I don't care for it at all. Just like all other perfumes, it makes me nauseated. I'll be giving this to a relative for Christmas.",2,Not for me,1207008000,"04 1, 2008",0.0784
3,A2W0O92FZFHJOJ,9790794231,Ronnie G.,"[2, 8]","Sorry about the title. . . I couldn't help myself . . . . Anyways, Let me begin by saying there are few things more subjective than a fragrance, especially a woman's fragrance. I'm a woman (and proud) and I know how finicky we can be. But that's besides the point, let's focus on Stella.Instead of expressing a biased opinion I'm going take a objective POV. I'm going to explain the ingredients . . .Yes you heard me . .the ingredients . . .Sure . .The /are/ listed here, but do you really know what they are . . .I'm not going to explain them all, but hopefully enough to help you understand the science of the scent as well as the actually scent itself. H'okay, here we go!*Centaurea Cyanus = the common Cornflower aka bluebottle aka the Buttonierre Flower*Squalene (which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark {most likely its just synthetically created now}) = a natural moisturizer. It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka Sweet Almond (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a skin protectant whatever that means . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent. It takes a mature nose to adjust to the kalaedoscope (sp?) of smells that is STELLA.",4,STELLLAAA!!!!!,1234310400,"02 11, 2009",0.1279
