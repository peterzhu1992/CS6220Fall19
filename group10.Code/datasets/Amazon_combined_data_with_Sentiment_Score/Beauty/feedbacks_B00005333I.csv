Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.Granted, they are still there a little, but it has only been a week. All in all, I say it works pretty well considering I didn't really have high expectations at all. I'll wait and see if it holds up over time.I don't have any wrinkles around my eyes yet so I can't speak for that part, but maybe it'll help keep them away.",4,Good,1388620800,"01 2, 2014",0.2771

I've used this now for about three months with absolutely no improvement whatsoever. It is pleasant to use and doesn't irritate my eyes, but just didn't do a thing for me.",2,didn't work at all,1326585600,"01 15, 2012",0.091

I have tried so many $$$$$$$$$$$ nothing works better than this.Some products are much too aggressive for the eye area.Having very sensitive skin/eyes, everything I have ever tried irritates my eyes, or is to heavy & greasy.This removes the dark circles, feels extremely cool when applying, is not greasy, but moisturizes & keeps those lines in control .I use it morning & night, can be put in fridge also for hour or (2) before if your eyes are puffy, works wonderfully for that !It's perfect, I hope it never gets discontinued I would be lost without it.Thanks",5,excellent product,1308700800,"06 22, 2011",0.5504

5,A1B440FN3PEW87,B00005333I,vgold,"[2, 2]","I've used this for a few months now and this just moisturizes. For reference, I have normal, slightly oily lids. My eye area is incredibly sensitive to retinol. I have really dark circles, mostly due to genetics.Pros:-my skin has not reacted negatively to this product-first ingredient is water, making this a good starter moisturizer for beginners-does not sting or bother my eyes much if I accidentally get some in-affordableCons:-does not get rid of dark circles. There is white shimmer in this gel, which will reflect light making it seem like your dark circles are lighter.-does not get rid/fill in fine lines.-dries tacky. I've varied the amount I put on and there's still a tacky residue through out the day. Might be good for those who use makeup.Although I wouldn't buy this again, I would definitely recommend this product to those just starting out with eye creams. Also, this seems like it will last me a long time. I do use this twice a day.",3,"It's Just A Moisturizer, So Don't Expect Miracles",1395273600,"03 20, 2014",0.2263
