1,AXYVSHTLWBINI,B000052YM0,Erin100,"[0, 0]","Nothing to say except excellent. I use this daily. I can find lots of ways to enjoy.I love that this product. I have this little bottle and the giant one and I won't be without.I keep the aloe in the shower actually.I mix some in my conditioner for extra hydration I apply to face after shower while pores are still open. Mix with oil and apply to body.I also mix one tbsp of this with 4oz water and a tsp of jojoba oil (or argan ) in a mister bottle for a frizz fighting spray. It works well. You just can't go wrong with aloe in my opinion.Aloe also makes a great styling aid. My bf uses this in place of gel now and he loves how his hair holds without looking hard and &#34;wet.&#34; It is also great for frizz free curls.I have troubled skin and I have really noticed that by adding aloe to my routine my face has calmed down a lot. It seems to give my skin a more even tone.I do a raw honey/citric acid mask in shower. Rinse. Blot with towel lightly. Apply some BP, spitz glycerin/ water, then apply a little aloe to lock it all in. My skin has showed huge changes doing this. My skin will never be perfect but this sure helped get it the best it can be.",5,Aloe freak,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",0.2812

I am returning this, Ican't believe the waste of money and time getting it through the mail. consumers need tostop deceiving to sell. :(",1,returning this. :( unhappy,1383264000,"11 1, 2013",-0.205

Also best for sunburn, the quicker you apply it, the better. If you search for the uses for this product you will be amazed. Never run out.",5,Use for a long list of things,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",0.5262
5,AVF2WMYRCFLGE,B000052YM0,Rocky,"[0, 1]","To begin with when I opened the Gel I was surprised it had no scent. However, it made up for that with the amount of hold it had for taming unruly curls and my edges. Also, the gel does not leave any residue or buildup and can be used quite often. It doesnt have any unhealthy ingredients such as alcohol which can make the hair have a crunchy feel instead of a soft supple feel. I would probably suggest this for people who have a unruly curls or edges. Just dab a tiny bit between your hands rub where is needed and voila your hair will come out great. An added bonus is Aloe vera has healing properties for the scalp and is extremely healthy. Lastly if doing a twistout or bantu knots I would recommend this.",5,Healthy and great hold,1363910400,"03 22, 2013",0.2652

I started putting it on after showering, and after just a couple of weeks started noticing healthier looking skin.I've tried quite a few different types of face moisturizers, and the only other two that match the effectiveness are hemp-seed oil, and coconut oil, but they both have downsides that the aloe doesn't. The hemp seed oil looks oily on your skin, and my wife hates the taste of the coconut oil :-)",5,The best!,1402617600,"06 13, 2014",0.1613
