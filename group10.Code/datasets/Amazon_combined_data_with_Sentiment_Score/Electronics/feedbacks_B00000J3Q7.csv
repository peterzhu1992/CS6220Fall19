0,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B00000J3Q7,Acute Observer,"[0, 0]","IOMEGA ZIP 100 Portable USB DriveThis unit is identified by its translucent light blue rectangular box. It uses a separate power supply. The Model Number is ZIP100USB. It can operate either horizontally or vertically (like a floppy drive). A device that connects with a USB cable requires Windows 98 or later. You should use the software EJECT command to remove a ZIP disk in Windows 2000 because the disk caching system may have data that needs to be written out. The IOMEGA software should be installed in Windows 2000 instead of the built-in support.The User's Manual warns against using the Operating System to copy a disk. Use the Iomega Copy Machine program. Right click on the ZIP drive to select the Iomega Format function. Use Short Format to delete all data on an Iomega disk. The Long Format repairs a drive with errors, converts from another format, or removes all passwords. Write Protection protects against writing over data, a password can protect against both reading and writing files. You can also flag the ZIP drive as non-removable so it appears like a hard drive. The manual has the details.Computers have a limited number of IDE devices and drive bays so a separate storage device is practical. Replaceable 100 MB ZIP disks provided vast storage in the past but are no longer the latest in storage technology. But the 100 MB ZIP disk is almost as universal as the floppy disk when you have a parallel port drive for older systems. The ZIP disks reuse deleted space unlike a CD whose space is consumed when you replace files. Falling prices for CD discs solved that problem. A ZIP disk has no compatibility problems between different systems and computers. A CD written on one system may not be updated by a different system.To test the status of a used ZIP disk. 1) Right click on the drive, select `Properties'. 2) Select the Iomega tab (after support was installed). 3) Select `Diagnostics', then `Close' after the green light. 4) Select `More Info' on the `Disk Type' Note the `Disk Life Status' and the `Format Life Status'. Percentages lower than about 85% are not good. 5) A `Long Format' can improve the Life Status statistics.",5,Useful Data Storage and File Transfer,1253232000,"09 18, 2009",0.0137

I then had to convert to a current word processing software, OpenSource.Org and then my intent was to plug this Zip Drive into my iMac and copy all those newly translated files to the iMac. But for some reason my iMac couldn't &#34;see&#34; or read the Iomega Zip Drive (it &#34;saw&#34; it at the USB Hub). So I had to buy a flash drive to copy those files from the eMac. Then I was able to copy to the iMac from the flash drive. (Their Customer Support said the drive had been tested through MAC OS 10.6 and it worked fine [have 10.7.5, Mountain Lion]). In a round about way, the technology served its purpose! Thank goodness. (The Seller was quick in responding to my questions. Good Customer Service.)",3,Amazing.

Great performance, fast transfer rate, not very noisy at all comparing to an LS-120 I own. I recently bought a Zip 250MB, and so far it's get my thumbs up! Full compatibility with the 100MB disks. If you want a portable storage device put your money on a Zip drive. CD-R &amp; CD-RW media are great. The only drawback is the media being used over and over. CDs aren't a very reliable comparing to cartridge disks. Cartridge disks are more reliable and last longer in the re-write processes of everyday backups of your files. And keep in mind that the Zip drives or less expensive and are easily transported anywhere, easy to install and work with. A+",5,Great Product!,977270400,"12 20, 2000",0.2387

After loading the software, Windows would not start, and still will not. I would not try it on Win 7 unless you know what to do when it won't start.

12,A243HY69GIAHFI,B00000J3Q7,tropic_of_criticism,"[37, 38]","As it makes little sense for the 100mb to be the original Zip you put on a new system anymore, most people who buy this product will probably be upgrading from an old parallel version. To be sure, it is an improvement on that device. It's noticeably faster. But it's smart for only a couple of very specific kinds of user.The first is the Backup Bandit. If you only use your zip drive for routine, automated backup of files that fit easily onto a single 100mb disk, it's unlikely you need much more than this device.The second is the I've-had-a-Zip-for-years Geek. If you have a huge library of Zip 100 disks already amassed, and the average file size is above 10mb, then there's an argument to be made for staying with this product. Notice that I'm talking here about a library of truly BIG files, typically graphics. If all you have is a massive library of text documents, you shouldn't fear switching over to the Zip 250 at all.In my opinion, anyone else should go for the USB version of the Zip 250, and add on a FireWire adapter when it becomes available.Why?Well, the Zip 250 USB with FireWire is simply the most flexible Zip out there. You can use it on literally any system that has at least USB ports, can achieve the lightning speeds of internal SCSI Zips if the computer has FireWire ports--and you don't have to sacrifice a scrap of portability. While the Zip 100 here can be fitted out with a FireWire adapter, it can't use Zip 250 disks. True, the Zip 250 is mysteriously slower than a Zip 100 if the files are something above 10mb. But you'll never notice the difference with the vast majority of files. What you will notice if you spend any time seriously archiving your work is how nice it would be to have a little bit more room on a 100mb disk. The Zip 250 solves that problem by giving you a lot more room to play in. In particular, the 250s are obviously better-suited to sharing larger multimedia files between computers, or even between platforms. Finally, the 250 simply LOOKS cooler. Those looks even translate into utility, because its trim profile really does make it a little easier to carry.In fairness I should point out that the 100mb appears to have a substantially lower price tag. But it's not, really. You pay on average 1.5 times as much for Zip 100 disks (per megabyte of storage space) than for Zip 250s. Long term, your storage savings with a Zip 250 more than make up for the up-front difference between the two models.",3,There are better Zip drives out there,968457600,"09 9, 2000",0.2262
