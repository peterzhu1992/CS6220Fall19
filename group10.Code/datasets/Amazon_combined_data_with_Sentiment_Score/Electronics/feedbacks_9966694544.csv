0,A2VTMCHYNBZC07,9966694544,Amir,"[13, 17]",I liked it. I is already formatted and no need for formatting it. My galaxy s4 recognized it easily and easy to use. The only reason I gave 4 star because it is not 32G as stated and it is only 29g. I don't know if that is supposed to be or not. I am happy anyway and would recommend this sd card to every body . You won't never regret .,4,Good and price worthy,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",0.1804
1,A13RIB5M9L611E,9966694544,Chad Brawley,"[1, 1]",Very High Quality and what a deal! Fast shipping. I trippled the memory on my Galaxy S4 for only $22.90 ship. Anyway now i can have all my music and videos and pictures on my new external memory and my phone runs great. I have the Samsung Galaxy Gear watch so I needed more room to install programs for the gear. Awesome deal!,5,what a deal!,1390521600,"01 24, 2014",0.214

3,A3EPT8ENSU0TU,9966694544,DN,"[2, 3]","Bought this since it said it was specifically formatted for the Galaxy S4, and for the first 2 months it was working fine. Bought it to replace a SanDisk 64gb MicroSDHC card that was prone to have problems.After approx 2 months, the card stopped reading in the phone. I tried other cards and they worked in the phone. The Kingston MicroSDHC card was dead and will not even read in my laptop or desktop computer, using different SD card readers. I can't format it, can't even read it in the Disk Management viewer, and can't do anything with the card now. Thousands of pictures and videos are now lost and that doesn't make me happy at all. JUNK card.FYI, I put the 64gb SanDisk card back in and that's been working great ever since.",1,"After 2 months, the card is DEAD",1393113600,"02 23, 2014",-0.0994

8,A3703H5T2Y0R0K,9966694544,J.P.,"[1, 1]","I used it for my Galaxy S4 for a good 6 months without any problems. And just today.. It's died. Won't work at all, can't recover any files, can't even format it to re-use it. It is now a worthless tiny chip... Thanks, Kingston. Won't be using this product again. Any one else who plans on using this for a phone, especially a Samsung, I would recommend you buy Samsung's brand for the SD card. I should have done that from the start, but I wasn't even aware they made an SD card brand at the time. (I should have known.. Samsung makes everything!)",1,Died after about 6 months,1395014400,"03 17, 2014",0.0436
9,A27DHWJ275D678,9966694544,Rev. George T. Cox,"[3, 4]","I bought the 32 gig. card for just that purpose, My Samsung phone, takes as good pictures as most cameras. In fact I like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s-4. I would buy it again and again if I needed a lot of memory. I recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera. I like to take moving photos with my Samsung, and those 8 second runs take a lot of memory, now I don't have to worry and running out of memory",4,I take lots of pictures with my Galaxy 4,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",0.3436
