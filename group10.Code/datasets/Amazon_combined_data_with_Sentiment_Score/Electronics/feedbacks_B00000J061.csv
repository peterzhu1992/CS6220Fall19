0,A3NSPDT7PQAUA5,B00000J061,ALC gadget lover,"[0, 1]","I bought this radio in order to listen to an AM station in my area that is very weak. Prior to getting this radio, I couldn't get it to come in on any radio in my house. Now, I can get it very strong and clear. The only complaint I have is that the dials on the front for volume, etc. don't seem well made and seems like they could break or come off. Since I leave it on the same station and same volume all the time, it probably won't be a problem. It also looks sturdier in the picture than it feels. It's pretty lightweight plastic. But, the only reason I got it was to receive this one station, and it does that job well.",4,Good reception for weak AM stations,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",0.1433

I was a bit disappointed in some areas, but still see it as something good. This radio is big. Period. Once loaded with D batteries, it can be used to tone those upper arms during long listening sessions. Quality control seems to vary from set to set, but a few things off the bat that I found were awry for my $50 were:1) Build quality. The switches and dials seemed on the flimsy side, with the chrome finish easy to rub off.2) Dial Markings. For claiming to be a DX Machine, both AM and FM fequency marks are more for wishful thinking than accuracy. Best bet is to find your local stations and re-mark the dial with whiteout or tape and the actual frequency re-written by hand.3) Audio. For using a large woofer,tweeter, and separate bass and treble controls, the audio quality could be better than it is. It still sounds good, but should be better.On the plus side:1) AM reception is fantastic. By turning the radio to null signals, I was able to pick up a small local on 1040 AM near Rochester, NY, then turn it again to cleanly pick up another station on 1040 AM in Salt Lake City. The wide/narrow setting helps greatly in picking stations from the weeds2) FM reception is quite good. Picking up low-power locals and larger 75+ mile stations is no problem for this unit. I didn't realize there were so many FM's around until I purchased this radio3) AC power cord. Fits neatly in the back of the radio (albeit a bit cramped), and having its own power supply instead of an adaptor eliminates any humming while trying to find faint signals.Although not quite as good as its predecessor the SuperRadioII, it does what it is designed to do - allow good reception of AM and FM without any bells or whistles to get in the way.If you can find it discounted, then pick one up and listen away.

4,A2T70SN2VZHOR4,B00000J061,Bill,"[17, 17]","Most radios you can buy have pretty cabinets, nice paint, and will sound pretty good if you're tuned to a station whose radio beams are about strong enough to cook an egg. They're designed to impress you in the big box store, where looks and the sound of the most powerful station in town are all you have to go on. It isn't until you get them home that you find out how miserable they are in real-world performance, trying to pick up that weak station that's the only one carrying the game you want to hear.The GE Superadio is a whole 'nother deal.It's just an AM-FM radio, aggressively avoiding any other features whatsoever. But it's the gold standard of the type. When a radio geek wants to say whether some other set is good on FM and, especially, AM, s/he will compare it to the Superadio.To give you an idea how good it is; I live in a semi-remote area without any really strong AM stations. Sitting side by side on my couch, a typical 'personal stereo' type radio picks up one AM station. A cheap transistor radio picks up three. The Superadio picks up 37.I recommend my friends get these as part of their blackout kits. For one thing, it will run about two hours less than forever on its six D-cells. For another, this set can pull in AM stations at least two, three hundred miles away, in daylight, any time. If your blackout extends farther than this radio's range, you've got more important things to worry about.Incidently, it runs off AC also. It switches to AC automatically when you plug it in, switches back to batteries automatically if AC isn't available.Sound quality is excellent. It's mono, but it has a good and large speaker and enough audio power to drive it properly. It also has separate treble and bass controls.I give it four stars instead of five for three reasons:1. Some of them don't work. The first one I bought didn't.2. Stations are hard for me to tune toward the upper end of the AM band. They're packed very tightly together there, and getting from one to another nearby is fiddly.3. The wide bandwidth is useless to me. There is no radio signal in my area strong enough for it. I have to use the narrow setting, intended for weak and distant stations, for everything.Still, it's a heck of a radio for remote areas, for camping trips, or if you want to know how well a radio can work if somebody at the company gives a darn.",4,The Standard,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",0.1168

We live in a small town and have trouble receiving AM stations from the city on normal radios. With the Superadio, there's no problem. The tuner is sensitive and easy to use, the speaker sounds good, and the dials are tough. I think this radio is a perfect part of anyone's emergency kit. You'd be able to tune in stations from far away in the event of a power outage in your area. So far I've used mostly the batteries for power and they're lasting nicely (the product instructions say they'll last for 460 hours of on time).

6,AXCWZ8HUF332W,B00000J061,Brett Buck,"[16, 16]","I got this radio to pull in both remote stations, and to have better reception. I also wanted something battery-powered for emergency purposes in case of power failures/earthquakes, etc.First impression is that this is one big, ugly, heavy radio. That impression never goes away, because it is big, ugly, and heavy. The apparent workmanship, fit and finish, looks like it was put together in the dark, by a developmentally-challeneged monkey, who had lost the instructions. It just looks, frankly, awful. Cheap plastic, poorly made (with all sorts of color swirls), with chrome paint. About like the interior of a mid-70's Chevy.It uses no fewer than 6 D cells. But the radio is so big you hardly notice. Most of the size comes from the 6 diameter of the speaker and the enclosure behind it. It probably to about half a barrel of oil to make all the plastic. There's also a very crude perforated metal grate over the speakers. All the knobs and switch *seem* like they will fall of at any moment, and the tuning dial and linear indicator are similarly questionable. It has a handle, and while you can carry it around, it's a portable radio in the same sense that the original beige toaster 128k Macintosh was portable.As far as entertainment products go, this radio is the opposite end of the spectrum from the iPod Nano.You might think that you will get some pretty great sound from a 6 woofer and a about a 3/4 tweeter. But no - the sound quality, overall, it not very good at all. It always sounds tinny and while it's plenty good enough for AM voice it's really not much better on FM.But, by golly, it does have absolutely terrific AM reception. Right away, all theproblem stations I had before were perfectly clear. With a Terk loop antenna, I spent a few late nights trying to see how many of the 50kW clear channel stations I could get. With care in tuning the antenna and the radio, I got the Hartford, CT, station on the first try. Didn't last too long, but I got it. This from *Sunnyvale, California*. It's relatively easy to get stations in Wyoming and Nebraska on good nights. Seattle, LA, Salt Lake, no problem anytime, even with the internal antenna.The tuning indicator is nowhere close to accurate and in any case the markings are so crude that you can't reliably set the radio using the existing marks. I just put some paper correction tape on the scale and marked the frequencies with a pencil.One thing that I didn't see in the other reviews, or anywhere else except the instructions, is that the radio is capable of being set to use 20 kHz bandwidth instead of the usual 10, meaning you get a lot better sound than normal. The speakers stink, but the reception is better and the incoming information is less compressed. Of course you want narrow for long-distance listening but if you listen to nearby stations it helps quite a bit.The FM performance is nothing to write home about, hardly any different from any other radio you might buy. It has AFC to help control the drift, and it seems to work just fine. But it's a mono radio, and the speaker quality limits the sound quality. It's bad enough that it will wear you out if you listen to music for long. There are tone controls, but no amount of fiddling with the bass and treble will fix it. If you want a good-sounding FM Radio, get the Tivoli Model One. It's about 3x the price but the sound is about 10x better. It's clear to me that virtually all the price of the GE went into the AM receiver part, and the rest of it was compromised to meet the *very low* price.With the huge battery pack, I suspect it will run a very, very long time on one set. Of course, it can also use AC.Crudity aside, the radio works exactly as advertised, has brilliant AM reception, will probably run forever on a set of batteries, and is so inexpensive for the performance that you really can't go too wrong.p.s. to clarify, my review is for the *GE* version, not the RCA version, which is still big, ugly, and poorly made - and also has terrible performance.

The engineers had their GE radio reputations on the line, and the concept of good mono vs. bad stereo obviously had market appeal.Over the years, inevitable cost compromise decisions have undoubtedly been made (I was part of some of these types of discussions as well), but when I was looking for a good portable radio, this version was high on the list. We have been satisfied with our recent purchase and would recommend a listen to anyone interested in good reception and sound. One problem is that there are relatively few retail outlets at which to check this out, but that's why we have Amazon, right?",4,A bit of history,1050278400,"04 14, 2003",0.3427

10,A233BX8N5692C6,B00000J061,Derek Hofmann,"[10, 10]","Within a couple of hours of unpacking this radio and without an external antenna, I was able to hear and identify five AM stations that were each over 500 miles away from my home here in Mesa Arizona: 1 in Salt Lake City, 505 miles; 1 in Denver, 577 miles; 2 in San Francisco, 666 miles; and 1 in San Antonio, 831 miles. I should point out that this was in the evening, when radio signals travel best.One station that has always been problematic for me (KBAQ 89.5 FM transmitting from the other side of Phoenix) came in loud and almost perfectly clear. Unfortunately, selectivity on this radio's FM band is poor (GE chose fidelity over selectivity in this case), so 90.5 FM in Tucson is completely drowned out by 90.3 FM here in Phoenix. After opening the unit and replacing the stock IF filter with a 150 kHz filter (please read the Superadio FAQ on the Internet for more information), I can now pull in 90.5 as well.Thankfully, the radio has a narrow/wide band switch that lets you choose selectivity on the AM band: narrow for pulling in those hard-to-tune stations, and wide for getting extra fidelity from closer stations.At $40, it's hard to go wrong with this radio. The next step up would be a shortwave radio like the Grundig S350 ($100) or the Sangean CCRadio Plus ($150).UPDATE: I have only 2 complaints about this radio:1. Moving the volume control has a big effect on volume at low volume, but a small effect at high volume.2. Because this radio doesn't have a digital PLL tuner, it can be difficult to find a specific station when it also picks up so many other stations on the same part of the dial that you weren't looking for.",5,Great reception for the price,1107475200,"02 4, 2005",-0.1714

I'd heard a lot of (mostly) favorable things about this legendary series of radios, and had to get one. I'm glad I did. Here's what I think.....Strong points:1) Great AM reception. Even during the day it's not difficult to pick up stations up to a couple of hundred miles away. At night, it can be several hundred miles. This radio has an 8 ferrite antenna, and when you hook up an external antenna like the C Crane Twin Ferrite, it really gets good.2) Very good FM reception (although I must admit I mostly just listen to AM talk radio.)3) Big 2-way speaker puts out nice, full sound.4) Separate bass and treble controls.5) Very long battery life (6 D-cells)6) AC cord included (but not used most of the time.)7) Great VALUE. You could easily spend 2 or 3 times as much to get a radio that doesn't approach this performance.Not-so-strong points:1) It's a big radio. It won't fit in your pocket or briefcase, but it's no boombox either.2) The analog tuning dial is not very accurate (as noted by many others.)3) Build quality is about middle of the road.

So I was prepared for some rickety thing that had parts ready to fall off when you touched it, and a viewfinder that was as accurate as throwing a baseball at the tuner knob. But the promise of awesome reception was all I needed to hear.First off, I work in a building which has a lot of electrical interference. I needed something to get past that. That was my only concern. So it didn't much matter, as long as I could get past the interference. Now that you know that, let me tell you about this thing.First of all it's not HUGE. I'm 40 right now, so I've seen rickety bulky radio's that would kill if it hit you. This is a nice unit, well sized for the speakers and antenna's in it.Second, it's very well built. I tried to pull off the tuner knob to no effect. Even the volume, treble and Bass buttons nicely placed on the unit can't be removed without some extra tool. The switches are only two function switches, and are well built. Granted it doesn't light up, and the tuner bar isn't a lit bar, but who cares, it's very well built. I tried to squeeze the unit to see if I could make it crack, no, it's sturdy.Now, for the TUNING ability. There is a WIDE and NARROW switch, which can either give you a very narrow tuning area, or a much WIDER tuning area. A station I listen to at 740am appears on the WIDE area from 700 to about 750 on the dial. However on the NARROW switch, it only comes in within a few millimeters of where 740 is. That explains why people say the tuning was so bad, they had it set to wide.So all things said and done, how did it do against the interference? Now basically I'm stuck in an area which is nothing short of several high tower power poles. The improvement was marginal. BUT to my surprise there are additional AM/FM jacks on the back that you can add an additional antenna or signal amplifiers to &lt;G> I grabbed a power cord, wrapped it around the AM port, and between the improvement in tuning, signal grabbing, and the extra antennae, I'm getting very decent reception with only a small bit of hissing.This is a very nice radio, well worth every penny I spent on it.

Miller,"[0, 0]","I have always enjoyed listening to far away AM stations at night (DXing) and this radio is one of the better ones for that purpose, even compared to much more expensive radios. It is simple to use with a large internal ferrite antenna. I have never connected it to an external antenna (screws for this are on the back) or antenna tuner, which I imagine would improve reception. Most new radios have digital synthesized tuners and while that adds tuning accuracy, it often adds noise that is bad for DXing. This radio is not the best built and has known quality control issues such as tuning inaccuracies that can be rectified. It isn't tiring to listen to because it has good sound quality due to the large main speaker, tweeter and bass/treble controls. The FM section works very well too. I do not DX FM so can't comment on it's long distance capabilities but it sounds good and holds the stations well. It uses long running D cells but I use the internal AC power supply - the AC cord is permanently attached.There are many reviews of this storied radio on the net you can read so I won't go on and on.

21,A2BLITJITO97N5,B00000J061,Ingalls,"[371, 384]","If you love AM radio and are looking for a radio that has fantastic reception your choice comes down to two radios: the ccradio plus and the GE Superadio. These are the best radios on the market for fans of talk, sports, Art Bell, Phil Hendrie, etc. Which one should you buy? I have both (the GE for my office, ccradio for home) so here is my take on the two. Both have nearly equal AM reception. At night, you can easily pull in stations from hundreds of miles away (some say even over a thousand miles away but this depends on where you live). There the difference ends. The ccradio has a lot of features that I felt I wanted in a radio. It has a sleep timer, accurate digital tuning, automatic timer that turns your favorite show on at a predetermined time, scan buttons, lighted dial, power cord (not bulky adaptor), weather radio (with auto alert), memory buttons, tv audio of the network stations. The only flaw is that it has a grab indentation rather than a full handle. They are a family business and take GOOD care of their customers. The ccradio company LOVES radio and loves people who share their passion. Is it worth the [$$] for the extras? To me it is. The Ge Superadio has a rotary - and inaccurate - tuning dial. This will drive you crazy if you do a lot of channel switching. Some people tape graph paper to the radio and mark where they found the stations - it is that inaccurate. There is no timer, no alarm, no weather, no tv audio, no lit dial, etc. The sound is better on the GE Superadio, though. The GE SUperadio feels cheaply made and probably won't make it through many beach or camping excursions. The GE Superadio is enormously sized - it is the size of a small attache case or TV! If you only want to pull in one distant station and keep your dial set to that station, get the GE radio. That is all you need. It has great, almost legendary, reception without any bells or whistles. On the other hand, if you love radio, need the extras, change stations a lot, want something sturdily built that will last a lifetime, want to explore the large number of AM stations that are out there, go out and order the ccradio with slightly better reception (see their website to order). I am a radio person rather than a tv person. I have radio playing all day (as some people have tv going on all day). I sleep to radio (and need that sleep timer). I would rather listen to a talk show than watch a sit com. I would rather listen to Coast to coast, Phil Hendrie, and Rush than watch another rerun of Frasier or Friends. If you are like me, do yourself a favor and invest in the ccradio. You won't regret it. P.S., the FM reception will be better than you are used to, also.Bottom line: The GE superadio is low cost with no extras and big and bulky. The CCradio plus is expensive, has every extra you could want (except a decent handle), more sensitive but does nto sound as good as the GE for music.",5,Astounding AM reception,1071446400,"12 15, 2003",0.2466

Corning Ware was introduced long before anyone even knew what a microwave oven was and it turned out to be the best cookware for the ubiquitous food zapper.Now, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III takes its place among such prescient products. Your humble communications technician, seeking to hear another human voice while on the job in a computer room, found the Superadio III remarkably well suited to the computer room environment.I had previously brought a Grundig Yacht Boy 400 and a Sony ICF-2010 to work to listen to an AM talk radio station, only to find out that what makes them so good for world band (shortwave) reception are the very things that meant disaster in the computer room's EMI (electro-magnetic interference) rich atmosphere. Being digital receivers, their computer-like circuits eagerly plucked from the air the squeals, drones and squawks of the network servers, PCs and PBX system that occupy the room while adding their own synthesizer noise to the weakened signal. I pondered the possibilities for better reception. I could put the radio nearer an exterior wall, crank up the volume loud enough to hear while seated at my desk, and be promptly thrown into the parking lot, since others in the room don't really want to hear the same station. Through the interference on the Sony came a commercial for the CCRadio by C. Crane, a tabletop receiver specially designed for long distance reception of AM news and talk radio stations (Translation: The speaker ain't so hot for music). Pricey but perhaps worth it.I read a few reviews of the CCRadio and another model kept popping up as the undisputed CHAMP of Long Distance AM Radio Reception, the standard against which other contenders are measured, the one, the only, ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for the GE 7-2887 Superadio III. Wow, I thought, how often I had seen them at WalMart and Kmart and how often I said to myself, yeah, right, Superadio, ha ha. Yet, here were some of the toughest-to-please SOBs who ever twiddled a tuning knob using this radio as THE benchmark. I was intrigued.A quick visit to the usual suspects (Best Buy, WalMart, Kmart) proved fruitless (&quot;Sorry, if it's not on the shelf, we're out. . .No, I don't know when we'll have more&quot;). In desperation, I came to Amazon.com, typed &quot;superadio&quot; in the Search box and there it was in all its &quot;usually ships in 24 hours&quot; glory, and for less than the best street price. 2 UPS Second Day Air days later, it was waiting for me at home. I didn't unbox the radio until I was back at work the next day.Even before digging into my Sausage McMuffin with Egg breakfast, I unpacked the Superadio III, plugged it in and was, indeed, amazed. The interference no longer dominated the signal from Los Angeles radio station KFI. It was still there, but not as much as on the Sony and Grundig. The Superadio III's analog tuner is, by its nature, more immune to it. Throwing the WIDE/NORMAL switch to the NORMAL position reduced much of the interference. Judicious tuning and adjustment of the separate bass and treble controls brought forth the desired sound while further fading the interference to a tolerable level. Thanks to the 2-speaker sound system, the Superadio III delivers more &quot;presence&quot;, allowing it to sound louder even though the volume might be lower than on a radio with inferior sound.At the minus end of the scale is the tuning scale itself. The aforementioned station at 640 kHz appears between the 650 and 700 markings (675 kHz?). If you do a lot of station hopping, keeping a station list with each's position on the 1-to-10 &quot;log scale&quot; above the AM and FM scales might be a good idea. Made in China and imported by Thomson Consumer Electronics, the Superadio III has a less-than-substantial feel to its construction and controls. Better-built radios DO come out of China (can you say &quot;Grundig&quot;?) but they also cost accordingly.For its price, the GE 7-2887 Superadio III Portable AM/FM Radio does just what you buy it for and will probably continue to do so for many years to come as more and more computer room hermits discover its ability to bring the outside world inside.

But I'll bet this heft is what makes the bass sound so good.I bought it because I wanted a good, inexpensive, big, vertical-format portable radio (I'm tired of the huge footprint and squatting look of most boomboxes today). I wish it had digital tuning, but it doesn't. The analog dial might not be very accurate, but in my experience, analog tuning has *never* been accurate. I've always had to tune by ear rather than eye.Features: Power switch (button) is separate from the volume control. So you won't be wearing out the volume knob every time you turn it on. Bass and Treble controls. A mono headphone out (meant for stereo headphones -- you get the same signal in each ear). Loud. Easily fills a good-sized room with sound. On AM, it has an optional wide mode which can give you really great sound on some AM stations, at the price of selectivity. On FM it has optional automatic frequency control which grabs the nearest strong FM signal (you may wish to turn off AFC for weak FM signals near strong stations). It has terminals for external FM and AM antennas. It has a nice, 36 long FM antenna, and a 20cm internal ferrite rod for AM. It has a nice handle on top, the kind that bangs into the FM antenna if the antenna is extended, so be careful. There's no light on the tuning dial. Again, you must tune by ear.Heavy, however, doesn't necessarily mean hardy. Everything is plastic on it except the antenna and the speaker grille.

The AM reception is fantastic, with a super-large internal AM antenna that can be supplemented with an external antennal for hard-core 'DXing. FM reception is so good you don't need the AFC function, but is only in monaural. Tuning does not drift away from the frequency like so many other tuners. There is also ample room inside the radio to add subcarrier circuits if you are into that sort of thing.The six D-cell batteries last for several months and are a boon for snow storms, power outages, and to tune in far-off stations without electrical interference. The power supply is well shielded from noisy power sources.The sound is very rich with a huge range of bass and treble, which is perfect for attenuating static and whine. The speaker is enormous and the radio features a high-quality tweeter. The sound quality both on AC and batteries is super-powerful.The volume and bass/treble knobs on the front are a little too small for outdoor gloved use but that's the only complaint I have. The antenna is easily replaced if damaged. It seems to be impervious to light rain and splashes but is not water-resistant.I have several of these radios and have given them as gifts. There appears to be some variance in quality between units, such as the maximum volume you can drive the speakers without distortion, but that appears to be due to changing suppliers of the large speaker. Some people are bothered by the frequency display not closely tracking the frequency you're tuning, but I don't think anyone really looks at analog frequency gauges anyway.This is an excellent radio and is great when it is on sale. The regular price is excessive, though, even for this level of quality.**EDIT** In 2010, this radio is now known as the RCA Superadio III. Model numbers include RCA 7-2887 and RCA RP7887.

Intermittently, the volume goes down to nothing..I can hear it only humming..A one year warranty comes with it and I bought mine about two months ago.. It's going back but I'm afraid that since the problem is intermittent, it won't be fixed.. Been there, done that..Never the less, it's a great radio as far as reception..Guess what? I bought another one today.. One for work, one for home use.. I'm sure I'll have to do without the original for a while it's being repaired though.I rate this radio very high for sound quality and reception (design) yet very low for quality of the build..

It's all great.It is certainly not feature rich but who needs all that nonsense for AM and FM radio? More feature would just get in my way.TIP: The radio has a ground screw on the back which I'm guessing most people don't use. After hooking up a long wire outdoor antenna, I noticed that what really helped AM DX reception was the ground!I bought a grounding rod from Radio Shack to isolate the radio from the noisy house wiring system. (I pounded in the rod in the ground outside the house.) That REALLY helped! So much so, that I removed the wire antenna and now only use the ground.",5,I've owned two for fifteen years -- fantastic,1196380800,"11 30, 2007",-0.0768

I should use it more than I have, but it still works very well. Of all my other radios, only the old Panasonic &#34;all-chrome&#34; model(RF-1600?) can shade it on AM, and the difference is *very* small, at best. On FM, the extra long whip antenna really helps here in the semi-sticks, and it does very well, if not quite up to my little Grundig G8 with DSP. Sound from the big speaker is excellent. Recently I've begun using it late on Sat nights to listen to 1120 AM from St. Louis- a long way from NE Texas! Fades in/out a bit less than my best smaller radios on that. Mine even has a fairly accurate tuning scale- tunes 650 WSM with the needle centered on the &#34;6&#34; of &#34;650&#34;, 1200 WOAI with needle on the &#34;2&#34; of &#34;1200&#34;- certainly too close to try & modify. Battery life is looong, too- manual states about 400 hrs on 6 alkaline D-cells. Want to use AC instead? Power cord & transformer are built-in, no wall wart to get lost.Warts? Power switch seems a little fragile, no light for the slide-rule dial. Some will miss a tuning LED lamp, and though it will handle headphones, no FM stereo through 'phones.Best testimony I've seen was from someone near New Orleans who had no power for weeks after Katrina, all local radio stations were knocked off-air, he used one of these as his primary radio to get news & info over AM stations.I've read lots of reviews stating that the later versions sold under the RCA name are problematic.

It has an excellent reception comparable to portable radios that cost over [price], and the quality of sound is very good.Pros:- reception quality on both AM and FM bands;- has a built-in power cord, may use batteries as well.- attractive price for the quality you get.Cons:- a bit heavy, I assume primarily due to speakers (it has two, one of which is quite large) and built-in power adapter;- cavity in the back to hide the thick power cord can barely accommodate the cord; I managed to back it back after several tries.- vernier (non-digital) tuning and no ability to pre-program stations; at the same apparently due to excellent reception, dial range for stations is very large, so tuning to a station is not a problem at all.- built-in power adapter makes a constant humming noise that at lower volume levels can be heard within 2-3 ft form the radio; I assume this is not a problem when using batteries.",4,Good value,1025222400,"06 28, 2002",0.4506

Look, I formerly lived in Ukraine and Soviet Union and to tell you the truth I haven't seen such horrible finish and quality in Soviet portable radios. Quality or a lack of it is just appalling. The tuning knob will fell off very soon. There's no soft material under battery door-so battery rattle (I put some paper inside it cured rattle). I understand this product made in China, but look you can buy Sony, Grundig, or any other quality product and they are made wonderfully in China, as a matter of fact, almost everything nowdays made in China. It's not a question whether or not something made in China it's a matter how good it made there. This radio is obviously was made in garage in China. Just tell me why, but why there's no light on tuning scale, how hard it was to put simple connection to simple bulb. GE seems not to care about quality of their product at all.

Good for news and talk radio, good for music of the 70's also, a true re-production of the 70's impression. :-) For AM programming, this is my choice. However, for FM and concert music, I go with Trevolie Model One, it's simply amazing and inspiring. And for an all around portable radio, the Grundig S350 is my choice, it is much more refined and functional. All three are keeper in my book. In my search of a portable radio, I bought all three within two month time frame and am very happy with the flexibility and quality I get.follow up to my initial review back to August 2004, my superadio is still on the first set of battery and working nicely, no trouble whatsoever. So far, I am convinced if it does not pick up the signal (both AM and FM), pretty much that's it; the station is out of range. I use it mostly for AM, yet, FM reception is just as good. By itself and tuned at a moderate leve, the sound quality is ok. Overall, a nice radio and well worth the money.",5,Excellent AM radio,1092528000,"08 15, 2004",0.4777
