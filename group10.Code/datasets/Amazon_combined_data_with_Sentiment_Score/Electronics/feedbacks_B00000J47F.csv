So I ordered 2 packs and was billed for 2 pack shipping. But when I received the batteries, it was a for pack. So if I only received 1 pack of 4 batteries instead of a 2 twin pack of batteries. Why was I billed for 2 twin packs instead of just paying for 1 4 pack. Very confusing.",4,Was a bite confused at first,1393545600,"02 28, 2014",-0.0421

Plan was to use them for my digital camera.They work, but unlike the batteries that ship with the Kodak (which are 1600 mAH-rated), these batteries are rated at only 1200 mAH. mAH means milli-amp hours and is a measure of the amount of power the battery can store and deliver before needing to be recharged.So, they deliver only 75% of the life of the higher-rated batteries. My digital cam responds to this with a half-battery indicator, even when all 4 batteries are at full charge.",3,These batteries are 1200 mAH,961632000,"06 22, 2000",0.0
