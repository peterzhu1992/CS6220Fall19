I liked this cable because of the small profile at the mini HDMI end and I figured the thin cable would provide less strain on the tablet's port.Cutting to the chase - I'd get flicker on certain scenes during movie playback. Always the same scenes, at the exact same time - so it wasn't a fit issue. But the scenes played perfectly when I switched back to my old adapter and cable. Also - I found I wasn't able to play big (20 gig+) 3D rips, when the other cable could.So . . . for most tablets and cameras this cable will work fine. I suspect this cable will be fine for the Tegra 2 tablets (Original Transformer, Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia, etc.) since playback is generally limited to 720P.
