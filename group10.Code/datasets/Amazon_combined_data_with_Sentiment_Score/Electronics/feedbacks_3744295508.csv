If I had a complaint, it was that I did not purchase a longer one for what I need it for. Of course, this is more of my fault versus the product.But, if the length works for you, and you need a HDMI cable, this will fill the job and do it very well.",5,Very Good for the Price,1333756800,"04 7, 2012",-0.0005

11,A3SGQUKYUATAM8,3744295508,J. Mathis,"[0, 1]","GOLD is good. Makes the best quality connections for data trans. Length is more than adequate (6ft), as length can attenuate (diminish) the quality of signals. Also, sheathing to reduce/illuminate cross-talk or interference both in and out of the cable. Used to connect BluRay player (Wi-Fi) to 45 inch Plasma TV w/o a hitch. Amazon Cables are just as good. I think they all come from China. The thickness of the wire and the GOLD plate are both factors in quality data links. Like the size of a hose for water, and how much pressure it will endure.With FREE shipping you can't go wrong, and they are guaranteed.
