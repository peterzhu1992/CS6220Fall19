9,A10GWHRIUD964P,B00000J1V3,James Sexton,"[0, 0]","I bought this exact same cable in the 25 foot length a couple years ago and was very pleased with it, and needed a longer length for my new setup. So I went to look for a 50 foot length of the same brand, same model (as it were). Found it (this one). Ordered it. Received it. Opened it.And then it hit me. THE STENCH! The cable I got REEKED of chemical, plasticy, rubbery odor that was HIGHLY unpleasant. This wasn't the case with my 25 foot cable! Perhaps they cheaped out on the jacket? Or just simply changed suppliers? I have no idea. But, if you have a sense of smell at all, avoid this cable. I ended up buying a Dynex 50' cat 5e ethernet cable from Best Buy for too much money. What can I say, I needed it right then. Something very similar is sold on Amazon for a lot less, but it doesn't look exactly the same (although it probably is). If it IS the same, then I can tell you that the Dynex cable does not smell at all and is a very nice and flexible cable which feels like it has some kind of high quality jacket material.Buyer beware.",1,STINKS!
