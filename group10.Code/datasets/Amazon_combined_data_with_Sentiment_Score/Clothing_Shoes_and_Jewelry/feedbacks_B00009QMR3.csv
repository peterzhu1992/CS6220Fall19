My little boy's Spiderman PJs are more convincing than this thing.",2,Fake mucles aren't very Spider-man like,1362268800,"03 3, 2013",0.3151

Fun costume that has held up well even after Halloween for regular play time.One word of caution, buy a size larger than you think you need. My boy wears a 5/6 normally, and the 7/8 costume just fit. With a layer of warm clothes underneath he was stuffed tight.",5,Great costume,1355443200,"12 14, 2012",0.3414
