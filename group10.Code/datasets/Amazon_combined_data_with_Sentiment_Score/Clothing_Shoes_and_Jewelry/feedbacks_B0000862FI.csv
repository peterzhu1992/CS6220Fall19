But trusty ol' Amazon has it! Yay! Ordered 2. Black & neutral. So happy to find this item. Ordered by my bust size. Perfect fit!",5,Perfect Slip!,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",0.3384

2,A17QZ5178IUHQ0,B0000862FI,Amy Paige,"[3, 3]","This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious, it is just okay. I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer. One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise. At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for, especially in this case.",4,okay slip,1297296000,"02 10, 2011",-0.2194

The slip &#34;clings&#34; to your body but does not seem to ride up when wearing. I would definitely buy again but will purchase two sizes larger next time.,4,Runs small,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",0.11

It's comfortable, cool (that was my biggest thing), and fits well. The straps do tend to fall down a little bit but you could easily stitch them in place. I don't see this lasting 20 years like my mom's Vanity Fair slip, but I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it!",4,"Decently made, fits well",1375920000,"08 8, 2013",0.4178

I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip. The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected. I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black. I wish there were more color options than just black and white.

Haiss girly girl,"[1, 1]","I recently bought several wrap and faux-wrap dresses that could show off WAY too much leg if there's a slight breeze, so I needed something a bit modest to spare the world a view of my blindingly white legs. This slip works PERFECTLY. It's beautiful and comfortable. It also makes me feel a bit like a '40s film star. Women need to dress like this more often!The fit: I ordered my bra size. I've got that lovely pear shape going, and it still fit perfectly over my hips. I'd order more colors (I got the black), but they're all out of stock!
