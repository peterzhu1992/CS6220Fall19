My friends are green eyed envious and want one. My only question is why doesn't the secondhand click evenly on the numerals on the watch face? I can't believe that one reviewer was upset that the watch crystal wasn't as bullet proof as the titanium watch case and band.",4,I love everything about the watch but why...?,1241222400,"05 2, 2009",0.1551

It's great if you are a cyclist and want to reduce every once of weight on your bike. Quite literally, it is about 1/3 the weight of an average steel band watch. It has a sleek profile compared to most steel band watches so rarely gets snagged on things while doing work. The face is also smaller than most comparable watches. About 1/2 way between a normal man's size watch and a womans watch. I personally like the color of titanium over stainless steel and have received compliments on this watch for that reason. It is fairly scratch resistant. I am very abusive with my watches. I wear them 24 hours a day even while working or in water. I do a lot of hands on woodwork etc. I've drug the face across some sharp metal stuff and this has put some light scratches on the face. Under normal use I suspect it would not get too scratched up. The band rarely comes unlatched even if you do happen to snag it on something. The pins have never bent or come out, ever! I think the titanium latch has better wear over stainless steel watch bands. The pins are probably also made of titanium. It don't know for certain but given the fact they've never come out I assume so. Titanium is much stronger than steel. The band itself is very smooth and comfortable. It never pinches the skin or feels irritating. The reason why I have had 2 now instead of one is that I crashed on my road bike during a 30+ mph sprint and it was drug across 10 feet or more of pavement after an initial hard impact. That broke the face of the watch and put some deep scratches into the titanium but the band never broke or came off. The hands were still good. If I remember correctly I think the watch was still working after all that until I started messing with the hands on it. I paid $100 for it both times. Now that I see they are a lot less on Amazon I think I'll buy another so if I eventually lose or break this one in maybe 10 years from now I'll have another to replace it. You will not be disappointed if you buy this watch. You will seriously be saving money because it is nearly indestructible and you won't lose it if you never take it off because the band doesn't ever break or come off the watch.",5,Best watch I've ever owned,1196985600,"12 7, 2007",0.0882

It arrived in a frosted plastic display cube - looks nice. Good price for this watch.,5,"Light weight and sophisticated.. had 1, bought a 2nd as gift",1353456000,"11 21, 2012",0.3543
3,A2HHQVQTQDHV9O,B0000643Q8,TominVista,"[1, 1]","Wow! I paid $67 for this exact watch on Amazon just a few weeks ago! I was shocked to see that the current price is $112.50. It's a great watch at $67, not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $69.95. The links are truly a bear to remove. I suspect that the link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links. You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather than from the outside edge of the band.",4,Price Jump!!,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",0.175
