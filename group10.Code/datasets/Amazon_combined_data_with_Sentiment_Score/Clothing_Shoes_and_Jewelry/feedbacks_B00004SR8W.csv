0,A18WUUFY45DOWA,B00004SR8W,Brent S. Ferguson,"[0, 0]",better quality than I expected for the price - was able to adjust it so it hung at the side rather than straight in front easily - this was our 'go-to' passport storage solution in Italy where there were a LOT of pickpockets.,5,Get this one it works.,1383955200,"11 9, 2013",0.8176
1,A319M5UYKNLK8B,B00004SR8W,Courtney L,"[1, 1]","I bought this, but it is too large for me. If I put anything in it, it is very visible under my shirts. I ended up buying a runner's belt with a pocket and that works much easier to strap around my upper waist. I also didn't like the idea of the string around my neck being visible. Thought of it getting caught or someone seeing it and pulling it.",3,A bit too large for me,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",0.0292

3,A1RBMSDM4N3M0J,B00004SR8W,JP Dog Lover,"[0, 0]","I bought one of these neck stashes for my most recent cruise and used it everyday while on vacation. You can adjust the strap to fit your taste. There are three sections and you can get quite a bit in it. I stuffed cash, my passport, driver's license and several credit cards in it and still had some room to spare.",5,Hidden Valuables,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",0.1857

6,A1EFMJQNZTZU9T,B00004SR8W,P. BENDER phil2246,"[3, 3]",Love this product. Its small and fits over your neck and under your shirt. I used it on my receint trip to Ireland. Its a lot better then a money belt. Its a lot easier to get to your money or papers and it is harder for anyone else to get to.
