1,A1CYTBE7LLUQ8F,B000067R84,Living in Budapest livinginhungary,"[1, 1]","I wish I had the camera out when our little girl first saw her Backpack. Her face lit up. She was so excited. She also loved 'Map'. Our girl is a small 1yr 9months, so the straps are a little big. Aside from it being a little too big on her back, Backpack keeps our girl entertained. She really likes putting things into it. I'd highly recommend this for every little Dora fan.",5,our little Dora fan loves her Backpack,1177804800,"04 29, 2007",0.3682

The map is hard for my 3 year old to roll up & Velcro back together.. Otherwise, the bag is sturdy.",4,"Cute, but cheap",1397433600,"04 14, 2014",0.1044
3,ACNON4BZACUUL,B000067R84,mommyofchristopher mommyofchristopher,"[4, 4]","Bought this backpack for my daughter to carry her Dora books in and it fits. But the weight of the 2 books made the magnet snap pop off constantly. I think it would be fine if you don't put anything inside the backpack, but if you want to put books in there like my daughter, then you would have to sew on your own snap or button. Cute!",4,Looks almost like the one that Dora carries...,1124236800,"08 17, 2005",0.2835

5,A3DPHU1UEI919U,B000067R84,"N. Rosen medstudent, mommy","[1, 1]","The kids just love this. Why---no clue. I ordered it because my friend asked me to order it for her daughter, so I ordered 2---one for my daughter as well. We live in the caribbean, where it's hot, so a thick plush backpack is something you don't want to have on your back. The color is cute too, but I can see it easily getting soiled. I didn't let this backpack out of the house, and ended up giving it to another child.I liked the pull-out map feature that comes attached to it though. The flap stays closed with a magnetic closure. Good size.",4,fuzzy & loved,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",0.3663
