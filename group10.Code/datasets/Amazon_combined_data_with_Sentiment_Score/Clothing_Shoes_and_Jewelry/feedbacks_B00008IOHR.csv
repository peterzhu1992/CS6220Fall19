1,AEDYUKWZQL63X,B00008IOHR,Gabrielle Chanel,"[0, 0]","It's not lined so you definitely might have 2 peaks showing through your shirt. The cup wasn't the right fit for me. I've been experimenting with finding the appropriate bra sizes and decided to try a 30F in this bra because a 30 E wasn't available. My true bra size is a 28E and my sister sizes are a 30DD and a 26F. I thought if I went in the middle and got a 30E it would fit but I was wrong. Definitely get your true size in this bra if they have it, If they don't, then I wouldn't recommend getting a sister size or guessing which size would fit.",3,It's not lined,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",0.1305

I did order two different sizes in one order, so that I would be able to know which one fit better. Glad I did. NIce bra at a decent price.",4,"Finally, a bra that fits",1373068800,"07 6, 2013",0.2845

I'm a 30G and I know I can't expect to wear those lacy cute bras the smaller girls get to wear, but I would like somewhat attractive. I'm not ready to look like a granny just yet.",3,"Supportive, yes, attractive no",1360454400,"02 10, 2013",0.4139

I am a 36 DD in all bras, this one, not to good.....Fav bras, Bali new comfort bra awesome, Bali t back bra, Gap, full coverage lace, and my very fav. Champion everday bra, wonderful, perfect fitting in each styleSo beware....",5,great for fuller figure,1176336000,"04 12, 2007",0.8497
5,A1XG0R7GMOVEBZ,B00008IOHR,Julie O,"[0, 0]","I wanted a black bra that would still provide lift but made it possible to wear button downs. This bra fits the bill. I will say that it does not look as good with looser (re: no delineation of form), sleeveless tops that have a high neckline because while this bra provides separation and lift, it my breasts are positioned farther apart than I normally prefer. It still keeps them within the frame of my body, which is what you want in a bra, but I do feel wider up top if I wear the above-mentioned tops. I could be having this issue because I decided to try a 30G instead of my normal 32F since whenever I check a calculator, it recommends the former size. The band feels good at a 30, but the cup might not be quite right. This is probably good evidence that you should always try on bras or their brands in-store before ordering online with a vendor that doesn't have the best return policy. If I had ordered this bra strictly through Amazon with Prime shipping, I might have returned it for a different size just to check if it was the bra itself or the fit. Overall though, great bra, well-made, and attractive. I will buy Fantasie bras in the future.",4,Well-made & Attractive,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",0.2329

7,A3VI1ATFO6K7YZ,B00008IOHR,Marie K. Gaudioso gaudilady,"[0, 0]",Cup is odd and puckers near the under arms. I've never had that in a bra before. Material is cheap and feels &#34;scratchy. This bra went back.,2,Odd fit,1364947200,"04 3, 2013",-0.0795
8,A2AWIYAE9G82XO,B00008IOHR,SAM,"[2, 2]","I have shopped at many bra shops in the US and Europe. If you are a 38G and short-waisted this bra is the one for you. I have paid over a hundred dollars in Houston for this bra, so to find it between forty and fifty dollars on Amazon is great. The bras are from England and the quality is excellent. The material the bra is made from never breaks down, it is the wire poking thru that signals that the bra is dead. When this happens I get out my sewing machine, fix the area and use it for another year or so. Even at one hundred dollars Fantasie bras are worth the price!",5,"Great for large breasts, short waisted women, 2 hooks",1321747200,"11 20, 2011",0.1311

I have been wearing Victoria secret bras for many years, but never get the support I need. The full size is very comfortable and the material is thin, which is what I wanted. I dont want to look larger.",5,I just ordered another one,1361145600,"02 18, 2013",0.2193
