0,A1ZPVW0WXNJ3YZ,B00000DMAO,Alex 47,"[1, 1]","I used to love this game; but now it's dated and now that I look back on it, it's not as fun now, either way, here's my review.Graphics: 8.5/10. This is a more realistic snowboarding game, so there are very realistic colors; unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors. 1080 features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated. Anyways, the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow. I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy. For that, this game got what it got in this category.Sound: 9/10. Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice, there's a different noise. There is a different sound for everything, which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N64 there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game.Control: 8/10. Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids. There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.Fun: 8.5/10. Nice and realistic, great events, and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any owner of an N64.9/10",4,Finally; a great snowboarding game.,1144540800,"04 9, 2006",0.0679
1,AQAMD65HGUGMO,B00000DMAO,cj the great,"[4, 5]","This game definitly fits the thought I had of a snowboarding game when I set out to buy one. The graphics are moderately realstic, the control is ok, and the sound is mediocre. I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this, but this edition suffices.It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N64, which was one of the reasons i bought it. Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination. I bought this as soon as I played it at a friend's house. You unfortunatley play with only 2 players at a time, but it is still fun to play your friend head to head. There are 6 courses, and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make. There are 5 characters that you can use to race, and more of which you can unlock. since there are only 60 head to head course combinations, there are other things you can do, like trick or time attacks.This can take a bit to get used to, as it can be boring for the single player. If you have a will and a friend however, this game will surely be worth it.",4,An Adequate N64 snowboarding game.,994982400,"07 13, 2001",0.3072
2,A23MMS6ZRF4KJ4,B00000DMAO,Craig Hightshoe TheCRH,"[1, 1]",I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.,3,Not quite what I remembered,1289433600,"11 11, 2010",0.1906
3,AODCE1AC7NOHW,B00000DMAO,cthoms,"[3, 5]","In comparison to other N64 games, this piece is a worthwhile buy. The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters. Two player mode gets pretty boring, pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety. The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours. However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points. Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder, and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day. So buy this game and spin in circles to your heart's content.",4,1080 Degrees of Thumb Rotation,983664000,"03 4, 2001",0.1321

So much fun that I still get the n64 out here and there simply to play this game. Has a time attack mode, trick mode, racing series, and a mixture of them all. Just a great classic that rates up their with 007 Goldeneye for classic N64 games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself.

It has all the best modes, Match Race&lt;this is where you earn hidden levels against the computer&gt;, 2 Player, Trick Attack, Time Attack,and Contest, this is one game that won't get tiring fast.

8,A2396ASCFP9L7F,B00000DMAO,naomiii,"[10, 11]","Once you get the hang of the controls, this game is awesome... it's challenging and entertaining, and everyone should have one.This game has amazing graphics-- you can even see the snow spray off the board when you make the slightest turn. Plus, the camera controls are flawless. The sound track is pretty good, too- you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk, and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too.My only complaint is that there aren't enough courses. After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the &quot;Black Diamond&quot; level, there wasn't much else to do. But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe.I think that anyone who has a N64 should add this game to their collection, without a doubt... it's a solid game, and you won't regret it.",5,A Must-Buy for everyone's N64 Collection...,977702400,"12 25, 2000",0.6459

10,A1U489SYAGQ2FM,B00000DMAO,Shorebird,"[0, 0]","Without any doubt, 1080 Snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game available.The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it. Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal.The mode and track selection is very nice, offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes. The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more.The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game.1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit.1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.Overall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.",5,"The best snowboarding game, hands down.",975801600,"12 3, 2000",0.4904

12,A3VHLYBTGQHQ7O,B00000DMAO,The Trophy,"[0, 0]","If you don't read anything else:If you find this game at a yard sale for $1.00 - $5.00 or online, then go ahead and get it, but in my opinion there are much better snow boarding games out for the N64, like Big Mountain 2000, Twisted Edge, or even Snowboard Kids or Snowboard Kids 2.Now I know that this was the N64's first snowboarding game, so we shouldn't expect the Taj Mahal in video game form here, but having played the previous mentioned snowboarding games and then playing this, there are some things that I dislike about this game. First, landing your snowboard in this game is more based on luck than skill. First, you have to press the Z button when you land and secondly you can't move your control stick AT ALL when you are landing or your player is going to fall over because the board is on an angle on screen. That right there ruined the game for me because it sucked a lot of the fun right out of the game. Also, if you want to try to play this game, I recommend plugging in an N64 controller that has a joystick that is still very firm. I started playing with my usually controller, where the joystick is a little loose and I was pretty bad. Plugged in another controller with a firm joystick, got INSTANTLY BETTER controlling my character in the game! Second, if you bump a wall you fall over. There are other snowboarding games on the N64 that do that, but here it seemed really prevalent. Third, the music in this game is really annoying sounding. I liked the title track, but after that I was treated to songs that had people with high pitched or dull voices yelling the same things over and over again! I would have preffered just straight up instrumental music here. Fourth, I noticed that PRETTY MUCH the only way of winning a race against the computer player, was to take a short cut hidden in each course. Sure you could try to out board them, but if you mess up 2 or 3 times (hit a wall or wall over) FORGET WINNING!!! Fifth, when you enter the competition events, YOU ONLY GET SO MANY CONTINUES and let's say you are playing on easy (Where there are 4 tracks) and you want to quit the 3rd race because you know you are going to lose and don't want to waste a continue. So you go to select Restart from the pause menu. YOU ARE BACK ON THE FIRST COURSE AND HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN!!! AGGH!!! Sixth, I did some of the time attack modes, I believe that's the right name for it. I am not positive right now.) Anyway, you have to board through certain goals (They look like a traditional marathon finish line) and I am playing the one level and the goal was on a cliff above me, that I had no chance of getting on from where I was and time ran out and I lost! WHY WOULD THEY PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE GAME!!! Put the goal lines where people have a good chance of getting to them. Not up on a cliff, that I could of went up on, 8 seconds ago, but now I am stuck!!!I loved the look of this game! That's why it was so hard for me to let go of the thought of getting fully into this game. I tried very hard to like this game, but I still couldn't bring myself to do that because of the mentioned above flaws. If you can overlook them, and you have the taste for snowboarding games you should be able to enjoy this game. Happy playing and thanks for reading!
