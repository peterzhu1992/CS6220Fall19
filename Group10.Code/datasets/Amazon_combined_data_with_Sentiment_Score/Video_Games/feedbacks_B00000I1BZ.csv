You might could say that this is a prequel to the Soul Calibur series. Anyway, I bought this title after I had already played Soul Calibur II and Soul Calibur III.By the time I bought this game, I was already accustomed to the great graphics, fluid movement, and responsive controls of the PS2 versions. That is the reason why I did not enjoy Soul Blade. I am sure that it must have been top-notch back in the days of the old Playstation, but today, it definitely cannot compare to Soul Calibur III. The basic idea is the same though. You have a small cast of characters who are seeking Soul Edge. Soul Edge is a sword with magical powers. It consumes the souls of those who use it. However, in return, they stop aging and they obtain combat powers that exceed that of even the very best warrior.You might want to buy this game and add it to your collection, if you're a fan of the Soul series of fighting games. However, I would not recommend buying it if you actually want to play.",3,A Tale of Souls and Swords,1168819200,"01 15, 2007",0.124
1,A1XOYXZG9VZZAE,B00000I1BZ,demonsRendangered,"[0, 0]",Soul Blade is the very first game in the Soul Caliber series. I guess it was Soul Blade in the arcade and became Soul Caliber years later for the Dreamcast and they decided just to go with that from then on. It's quite a classic in my opinion. That's actually why I bought it because to be honest the game play has aged a bit and there are much tighter fighting games out there now. It's still a great game to have though. Aside from being the arcade game there is also a weapons master mode in which you select a character and play out a story where you travel the land acquiring new weapons in search of the legendary Soul Blade. If you were into arcade fighting games in the 90's then you should probably have this.,5,Transcending history and the world...,1392854400,"02 20, 2014",0.033

My friends still come over so we can all play it on my PS2!! This game is tight,especially for a PS1 game, I just hope Soul Caliber 2 is made for the PS2! For the price this game goes for, it's worth it completly! I traded Granturismo3(PS2game) for it!",5,Soul Blade good enough foe PS2!!,1004918400,"11 5, 2001",0.4405
3,A1ZYZ5853ZADZA,B00000I1BZ,Eric Johnson,"[6, 6]","When 3D fighters first entered with Virtua Fighter, I was not impressed. Add to that the dismal nature of the Star Wars fighter and things did not look promising. But, thanks to games such as this and Tekken, the fighting genre was saved. I first played this game in the arcade and was floored. Gone were the glitching side to side movements. In were smooth animations with amazingly real movement. It translated as close to flawlessly as possible to the Playstation.From the opening sequence to the finale, I was hooked. The graphics are amazing. The characters are very well rendered and rather well balanced. You have your constent movement, fast players as well as the guard forever and kill in one blow slow guy along with many consistent characters. My favorite character is Taki, but that's probably because she reminds me of Chung Li.Game control is excellent. Combos rely less on stick movement than on button combinations, which makes it much easier for beginners to pick up. Throws are actually a challenge to execute, but are worth the work. The backgrounds are truly amazing and the soundtrack is something else. The tracks are very deep with what seems like full orchestration.Of course the greatest fun is playing against other people, but the single player formats available are quite good. The Edge Master mode is somewhat RPG-like in nature and is a nice addition. My favorite mode is the team battle where your 5 take on the opponents 5.For the price, you absolutely cannot beat this title. The gameplay is great and the controls are rather intuitive. Give the bonus of amazing graphics and sound, if you like fighting games, you'll love this one.",5,My favorite Fighter,963100800,"07 9, 2000",0.3112

I love playing this and I love watching the animations from the characters that are STILL identical to the ones used on later Soul Calibur games! They didn't change some of them!
