There is quite a bit of stuff to do and the game is kind of challenging. My only problem is the movement is a little goofy feeling at first, but you will get used to it.",4,Croc: Legend of Kawaii Goodness,1394150400,"03 7, 2014",0.3014

It's actually really adorable, and has a good setting with cute characters. The camera mode you do have to fiddle with though. But you do get used to it. I was definately hooked on this game, cute, challenging, and fun. 5 stars all the way!",5,This Game is Really Fun!!!,1085616000,"05 27, 2004",0.3
3,AMZCQIDUWDHLC,B00000I1BS,John. N,"[0, 0]","Croc is one of those games I only had a small chance encounter with when I was younger. The demo disc that came with my PlayStation back in 1997 had a demo of the game and by all accounts I was pretty taken with. The graphics were bright and colorful, the world it presented (and by extension Croc and the Gobbos) were cute and likable and overall it seemed to be a pretty solid 3D platformer. Developed by Argonaut Software who developed the Super FX technology used in Nintendo's Star Fox on the SNES in the early 1990's, I ordered a copy of the game based on those memories... but fifteen years is a long time to be away from any game and with advancements in gaming this leaves little room for error. Unfortunately, if the title of this review is any indication, Croc pretty much squanders most of the good will its positives bring to the table and only serves as a history lesson as to why the series never saw daylight after the 32-bit generation.Almost all of Croc's problems center on the controls. Well, it's not completely on the controls, rather it's a combination of the controls AND a camera that does whatever it wants - but if it wasn't for this I firmly believe more people would remember it. The game's controls are not unlike those in Core Design/Edios' Tomb Raider series - which in today's world some people find rather archaic - but I'm still at home with them since I grew up with that game. What makes Croc different (and ultimately more problematic) is the camera is not completely locked behind Croc at every moment. This makes certain moments of the game painful to play and its because these controls are more befitting of a game like Tomb Raider where the game world is more technical being built on a grid of squares. This isn't the case with Croc.Well, that's kind of a lie because the further you get in the Legend of Gobbos the more technical (and challenging) the levels are with all their little platforms and obstacles where the clunky controls become a real liability. Even worse are the controls when Croc is underwater or doing a mini-game as these sections are simply horrendous. The situation with the controls is a real shame since the game (aside from the utterly pathetic boss battles) would still be astounding today if it wasn't for them. It's (kind) of possible to enjoy Croc despite its problems but I personally had to play the game in small bite-sized portions to really avoid my building frustrations - a red flag for a gamer if there ever was one.Despite Croc's shortcomings I can't really tell people to flat-out avoid the game. I still have a soft spot for it (and the characters) despite what I experienced while playing through it. Still, if you can I'd recommend trying - or revisting - the game before you buy it. For those that played Croc when it originally came out nostalgia might be enough to save it, but those without an attachment to the IP will quickly see the game as the ailing entity it is.",3,Would be a PS1 classic if it wasn't for the controls...,1386288000,"12 6, 2013",0.0245

5,A2A14RBCFGMV7L,B00000I1BS,Mali,"[1, 2]","This game has everything it needs to be GREAT! It IS great. I've never played Croc 2, scared off by difficulties in the first one. Yes, I agree, the controls are horrible. I can remember spending 7 minutes climbing platforms only to miss a cage, jump down, take 5 minutes back up, and fall down right before the top. &lt;SCREAM> It made me even madder because the characters are the cutest, you collect things like Spyro and Ty, it's the cutest story, and I WANT to play it so, so badly...but the diificult controls make that impossible. For Greatest Hit couldn't they have fixed that ONE problem?? If they fix the camera/controls and make Croc 3, I will pre-order it.",3,So much potential!!,1121904000,"07 21, 2005",0.2742
6,A1F23MY8SB905X,B00000I1BS,Mitch,"[0, 0]","I played Croc 2 more often, but I did play Croc: Legend of the Gobbos when I was young. These games were so fun, as well as difficult (I never managed to get 100% completion on either of them). The controls are a bit stiff, but this did release in 1997, so that should be expected. The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple, but the game is fun nonetheless, and for me it's a pretty timeless classic, that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games.

In my mind this really isnt a Kids game though. to beat the game 100% actually requires alot of time and effort. Its more the type of game you can play and kids will watch. The controls are pretty easy. its basically MARIO but your a crocodile exploring diffrent levels, theres really nothing groundbreaking.The game does keep your attention and you will have fun completing the levels. A good game if your a patient person, if not youll wonder why its taking you so long to beat thiskids game and make you feel stupid.",4,Cool Little game,1210723200,"05 14, 2008",0.2894
8,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,B00000I1BS,S. Rhodes,"[1, 1]","Croc, original released in 1997 had the same appeal that Crash Bandicoot had. It was a simplistic game that was absolutely gorgeous to look at. Obviously inspired by Crash Bandicoot and Super Mario 64, Croc was a game that could've been for everyone. However, lackluster controls and a bad camera make Croc more frustrating than fun.As with most games aimed at the younger audience, Croc has a simple story. The Gobbos have been kidnapped by an evil Baron. It's up to Croc to save the Gobbos and stop the Baron. And he'll traverse four worlds to do it.The level layout of Croc is surprisingly good. Levels are pretty straightforward but you'll be able to veer off path whenever you need to. In every level your goal is to get to the end and ring the gong. Along the way Croc will be faced with enemies and natural traps like lava or freezing waters. In every level you'll also collect gems. From level to level the total gems you finish with stack up on each other. For every 100 gems you'll get an extra life, and you'll need those lives. There are also six Gobbos in every level you venture to. Five of them are scattered throughout the level randomly. However, the last Gobbo requires you to find five special gems and open a special door at the end of a level. Upon finding those gems and opening a special door, the game will usually make you play some kind of bonus game or solve a puzzle to get the last Gobbo. Some of these parts of the game are incredibly frustrating. For example, in one bonus game you'll have to make Croc jump on buttons in order to whack sheep in a sort of Whack the Mole fashion. However, it speeds up and the controls aren't all that friendly.That may very well be the biggest problem with Croc. The game is such a pain to control. You'll suffer a lot for this. Up always moves Croc forward but the camera is always moving. Croc doesn't turn sharp enough so you'll mostly spend time stopping and turning so that you can continue on your way. This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't enemies on your tail or if you didn't have to stop and turn on a collapsing platform. Even worse is the camera. You don't get control over it at all. The view doesn't shift fast enough which may lead to you running into an enemy simply because you don't know where it is, or having to quickly jump off a collapsing platform. These issues make Croc--an already challenging game as it is--harder than it has to be. It's frustrating as well. The game has potential, and the right gameplay elements, but the controls make it too hard. However, it is still a good challenge. Completing the game 100% by finding all the Gobbos and getting the second ending is a task in and of itself.What Croc lacks in gameplay it certainly makes up for in everything else. The game looks stunning. Especially for a Playstation game in 1997. The FMVs look incredible, the bosses look spectacular. The environments look incredible as well. There are hardly any Playstation games that look this smooth or run this well. The soundtrack is also a beautiful soundtrack. In terms of production values, Croc is an astonishing game to behold.In short, Croc is a good game, but a game that would've been so much better if it didn't suffer from such horrible controls and a bad camera. It's a fun game, but only barely so. There will be many gamers who won't be able to let those issues slide.",3,A Good Game Ruined By Horrible Controls,1202947200,"02 14, 2008",0.0546
9,AFIQFW8URWYAC,B00000I1BS,Zaro27,"[0, 0]","I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. She used to play this game all the time when she was a kid, so I figured I'd get her a new copy. She loved it. Now, I'm not so keen on platforming but I promised her I'd give it a shot. It's not terrible but the controls are poorly designed. The most fun I had was using the side step buttons to make Croc dance, which is freaking adorable and hilarious. Side step animation is perhaps the single best reason to play it, unless you're into kinda bad, old platformers. As I said, I'm not a platformer guy. She loved it though, so if platformers are your thing and you don't mind super retro design, give it a shot.",4,"Classic gaming, weird design choices, decent fun",1363478400,"03 17, 2013",0.3788
