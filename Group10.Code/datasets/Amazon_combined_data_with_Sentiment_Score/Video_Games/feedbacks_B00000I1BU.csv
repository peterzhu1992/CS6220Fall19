0,A3GKMQFL05Z79K,B00000I1BU,blackaciddevil,"[0, 0]","Jet Moto, Sony's answer to Wave Race 64, was an instant hit for Singletrac back in 1996. Singletrac, best known for its' Twisted Metal games, set out to make a futuristic racer in the vein of both Wave Race 64 and Wipeout and succeeded. Players control riders on hoverbikes which hover close to the ground and can be driven over land and water. The game utilizes a system called the Magnetic Grapple in which pressing an assigned button creates a magnetic attraction between the player's bike and red energy poles that are placed throughout the courses. This enables the rider to swing around tight turns with his bike without slowing down. If done properly, it helps players cross gaps to large to get over as well as propelling riders out of turns alot faster than when going in. Chracters are split in teams with bikes adorned with logos of sponsors just like in real-life racing. 20 Characters and 3 tracks are available at the beginning, with seven more tracks unlockable by winning tournaments.Jet Moto is best known by fans for its' suicide courses. Tracks have a point A and point B. Racers begin at point A racing to point B and back again, all the while facing other oncoming racers coming towards them. It's also known for its' somewhat outrageous track structure mixed in with traditional courses.I fondly remember setting up all night on the weekends with friends playing this game, just to see who had bragging rights when the night was over. Most of the time they'd win but, every once in awhile, I would win. I'll admit, it took alot to beat this game. I love this game and still play it to this day.",5,Jet Moto......,1281312000,"08 9, 2010",0.423

2,A1WODHQ4IPYSAE,B00000I1BU,Duane,"[0, 0]","Graphically, Jet Moto is one of the worst games I've played for the PS1. I prefer the second Jet Moto over this one. It's extremely hard, you only get boost refills once a lap, and the computer controlled players try their best to wreck you. Just an overall frustrating experience.",3,Doesn't hold up well,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",-0.0826

You can even upgrade your bikes I think. Such a fun game.,5,Awesome game for Multiplayer,1242604800,"05 18, 2009",0.4626
4,A3CXIWY00AU51G,B00000I1BU,TripsCallerDoh,"[0, 0]","This is the game that got me through medical school. I still play from time to time and definately when old friends get together. The physics is fantastic. The strategy is to maximize your inertia. Turbo on long straightaways. Turn as little as possible. Of course you do have to turn quite a bit. Once you have won the season you get to do stunt races, where certain stunts recharge your boost. After mastering the game it is still fun to try and race for times (whole course under 30 min is good) or race against a friend. The sequal JM # 3 is also great, JM #2 I was never crzy about but it looks cool for ps1 graphics.",5,still playing after >10 years,1207094400,"04 2, 2008",0.3572
