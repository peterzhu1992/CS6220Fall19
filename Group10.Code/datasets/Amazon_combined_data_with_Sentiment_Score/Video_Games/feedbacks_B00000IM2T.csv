0,A9998RE3AEA95,B00000IM2T,Alex,"[8, 8]","I was very surprised with Legend of Legaia when I first played it. Although the basic RPG formula is still basically intact, there are a few radically innovative bits that seem to work quite well.Take for example the amazing battle engine: while turn-based at its core, each character's basic attack is instead a series of kicks and punches that YOU enter (at the beginning of each round). Specific sequences of kicks and punches unlock &quot;Arts&quot; - combos that you can perform at any point in the game. Furthermore, you can chain Arts in combat if they share their first and last moves, and, what's best, you can perform any Art at any given time, giving you total freedom in combat. Most Arts are learned through experimentation, while a few are taught to you by a variety of casual mentors. To save you the trouble of writing the arts down, the game keeps track of the ones you learned in notes that can be called up either through the status menus or directly in combat. Magic in Legend of Legaia is all summoning. During combat you have the chance of absorbing the powers of a variety of enchanted monsters, and thereupon summoning them to cast spells. If you summon the creature frequently, it will increase in level, making the spell it produces more efficient and perhaps even add a side effect.Seems as though Sony threw this amazing thing in and then forgot to capitalize on it. Makes me wonder why they capitalized on the far more restrictive battle engine in Legend of Dragoon.Graphically, Legend of Legaia isn't much to look at (or listen to), with ungainly polygonal surroundings and fully polygonal characters who look like blocks on a string. Thankfully, in combat the characters are realistically proportioned and animate realistically. Also, their faces are very expressive and well-detailed.A diabolic mist has enveloped the world years ago, turning the enchanted Seru into deranged monsters, and their human possessors into mindless zombies. It is up to you to revive the Genesis trees spread across the land in order to destroy the mist. If the story sounds off-beat and unexciting, it is still your formulaic save-the-world story we have come to know and love in many RPGs. The plot is as unobtrusive as they come. There is nothing unnecessary, no confusing tangents, no bland, endless dialog, nothing to detract you from the gameplay.Now, to alerts: this is a slow, SLOW, S...... L...... O...... W game. Travel on the overworld is very sluggish. Character advancement is equally slow. Get ready for tactical level-building, lots of it, because the bosses are tough. If you like your games to move at breakneck speed and half-blind you with glitter of many explosions, Legend of Legaia may reduce you to tears in under an hour. But if you're in for a good, old-fashioned RPG experience, you will most certainly enjoy this game.",4,Innovation you can enjoy,967680000,"08 31, 2000",0.1672

2,A210RFI1LH1F8F,B00000IM2T,Blade Wolf,"[0, 3]","I've had Legend of Legaia for a number of years. I've picked it up and tried to play through it countless times. The verdict... It starts out OK story wise, has a nice battle system on it, but it falls flat after a while. Let me elaborate.First off, the good about this game. An RPG's battle system is one of the most important elements of the game. About 50% of your gameplay time in an RPG is spent battling. That being said, Legend of Legaia has a very nice battle system. It's turn based (which means you can stretch between hits) and offers what many have called a fighting game inspired attack system. Basically, what that means is that the directional buttons are used as the primary selection tool in battle (the X button is only used to confirm attacks and select magic). Combo attacks are initiated by entering certain combinations in Attack mode (up {high kick}, down {low kick}, left {left hand blow}, right {right hand blow}) and not only are nice and damaging but are pretty spectacular to look at too. But, the good stops there.Here's the bad. First off, the random battles. I love RPG's, but I hate random battles with a vengance and in Legaia they spring on you every two steps in any given dungeon. This ensures that the player will quickly become tired of the battle system.Secondly, the way that the magic system is set up is a pain in the butt. Creative, but a pain in the butt. Unlike most RPG's, where the characters aquire new magic by gaining levels or buying it from shops, Legend of Legaia has a somewhat Pok&eacute;mon-esque method whereby the characters must absorb the powers of enemy Seru into their Ra-Seru in order to learn new spells. This wouldn't be too bad if the chance of absorbing a Seru's power weren't so low (maybe a 20% or 40% chance) and that for a character to aquire that Seru's powers, he or she must land the final blow him or herself. That can lead to hours of frustration trying to learn new attack and healing magic. When trying to learn new spells becomes a chore, you have a problem.Third of all, the story line. The plot is really thickest toward the beginning of the game, then becomes less and less engaging as you play. I mean, it starts out promising but never really picks up the pace! The most exciting moment in the game is the attack on Rim Elm (right at the beginning of the game) and from there it never really takes off. For the love of God, they had a demi-god that sleeps in the form of three freaking infants giving random prophecy in a freaking cave town that keeps falling apart! What the Heck! That's the part when you know whoever wrote the script for this game was having some monster writer's block that never really went away.Fourth point, the music. Now, I know most people don't care much about the music in an RPG as long as it's bearable, but the music in Legend of Legaia would be better replaced with the sample music tracks from RPG Maker. It's OK for short sperts of playing, but after a few hours in a dungeon, it gets redundant.Number five, the graphics. Now, I know this game has OK graphics for its time, but it's more the way that the graphics effect the navigability of dungeons that has me. The color pallet for this game tends to be overwhelmingly dark, especially in caves, and in certain areas it's hard to tell a wall from a door from an extension of the floor because the colors and textures merge together so much. Not fun when you've been through 800 random battles, are low on health and healing items, and are just looking for an exit.Lastly, the two most annoying things about Legend of Legaia: Save Points and the price of upgrading equipment. In this game you can only save on the overworld map and at save points. The problem with the save points is that they are so far apart from each other in the dungeons. The save points tend to be one per average sized dungeon and sometimes two, and always about an hour or three apart from each other. This can cause headaches when you just want to quit but there hasn't been a save point in sight in the dungeon for hours on end. And the price of equipment upgrades is just plain wrong. To afford new equipment, you have to run around in circles of about an hour or so fighting to just be able to afford the next sword...after fighting every monster from the last town to the one you're in now without running from a single battle. This leads to hours and hours of trying to get into a fight (which, as it turns out, is the only time when you're not jumped every three steps). This, in turn, leads to boredom.So, in closing, Legend of Legaia is a decent game if you can stand the frustrations stemming from its faults. The battle engine is good and you can always Mystery Science Theater on the plot if you're so warped in humor. But, if you hate getting hit with random battles, being over charged for equipment, never being able to find a save point when you actually need one, and getting lost in confusingly rendered dungeons, then leave this game alone.",3,"It's an OK game, but...",1226188800,"11 9, 2008",-0.0833
3,ATVD3TLOXJRI9,B00000IM2T,bosley83,"[0, 8]","To sum it up, Sony didn't do that great of a job trying to find a way onto the ever growing RPG scene on the Playstation. It lacks a strong story, mostly. You run around reviving Genesis Trees to remove the evil mist that has transformed kind creatures to evil little monsters. That's right an evil mist is your enemy. I as much a believer in the etherial realm of evil as most people but come on. You don't actually expect me to fight mist. They try to tack on a final boss but he seems oddly removed from the evil from the mist so his presence makes little sense. The battles, though the engine is innovative, are much to long. A battle can last anywhere from 3 minutes to almost an hour. The main reason that the battles are so time consuming is because of the lengthy entering of the combat combos that your character uses. The game just stops being fun when you have been in the same dungeon for two hours because you are getting into too many battles. The dialouge is also very dry and foolishly written. After meeting the character Noa I knew that I wanted her to be killed by the mist. She is maddingly annoying, and she runs around like some mental midget on steriods. The other two characters have no personalities. This makes it hard to get involved with the game. The pluses. The aformentioned battle engine innovativeness. Also when you buy a new peice of armor or a weapon you actually see it on your character in battle and they actually use it. Their are some really odd looking weapons and armor. The bad part is that gold is very difficult to come across in this game. My words to you. Do not buy, do not rent, do not do anything with this game. It should be burned and its record removed from the planet. This game does not belong with anyone Playstation collection.

The graphics are top-notch for the time it was released, and the environments vary from being colorful to plain dark with a very fitting soundtrack that hums perfectly with its perspective locations, and the controls are pretty solid, and you can even use the analog stick, which is pretty neat for a game that was originally released in Japan in 1998 with a 1999 US release. The enemies can be rather creepy, which adds to the overall appeal of it. The story is rather entertaining with plot twists that will keep the player going, and the idea of mist being such a poisonous element to the world seems interesting in itself as there are some deserted towns that were deserted from the movement of such a lethal element. The battles have various combinations that characters can use to defeat opponents, and some of the bosses will require having special moves to defeat them, as they can rake up in difficulty very quickly.

5,A11LS12ZU93SV6,B00000IM2T,DeRosset Myers DeRo,"[1, 2]","Legend of Legaia is a relatively simple RPG with a new twist: now you can customize the way you attack your enemies. This makes it look sort of like a Tekken game, but it's still menu-based.The story begins when Vagn, the main character with blue hair, is preparing to go hunting. Of course, like almost every RPG story that starts out with a plan, things take a turn for the worst: Vagn's girlfriend's father gets killed by monsters in THE MIST, then an evil entity invades Vagn's village. Now Vagn must go on an adventure to stop the mist permanently. The guy who was killed isn't especially important; Vagn is just sick of people dying.On his way, Vagn meets a young girl named Noa and an Akuma look-alike named Byron (if I remember the name correctly). Sorry to cut off there, but you'll have to play the game if you want to know more. It's worth it though.What I especially like about Legend of Legaia is that it fits into the 32-bit era without sacrificing bizarre hair colors.

8,A1IQV6AI7L9NOK,B00000IM2T,Feelah the tigress,"[0, 0]","I don't think this game is as well-known as other games, such as the Final Fantasy series, but it's still a pretty good RPG. It's not the best out there, but it's really fun to play and is a solid entry in the RPG genre. Let's find out why!Graphics (score 8/10): The graphics kind of remind of Final Fantasy VII's graphics, although I'm not sure if they came out around the same time or what. They aren't really exciting by today's standards, but they work well enough. Legend of Legaia may not have the best graphics, but it makes good use of what it has. In fact, the enemy designs and area settings are pretty unique and inventive. Overall, the graphics aren't too hard on the eye.Music (score 8/10): The music is pretty good, and somewhat memorable, especially the overworld theme. There is some limited voice acting in the form of battle phrases, most of which are in Japanese. Each character only has three moves that are voiced in English, which don't even play every time you use that move (it cycles randomly between that and the Japanese phrases). To make matters worse, the few English phrases like Tornado Fist sound a whole lot like butchered Engrish. I wonder what happened there. Were they not able to afford more than a few phrases voiced in English? Or decent voice actors? They really should've kept it all English or all Japanese. Other than that though, I have no complaints in this category because the actual music is awesome.Characters (score 6/10): The characters themselves are not the best in RPG history. Firstly, we have Vahn, who never speaks and has no personality. Yep, it's the old silent protagonist. The game even makes fun of this--there's a scene where Vahn steps into some hot water and turns red, then jumps back out, all without saying a word. Then, this guy walks over and says, if the water's hot, you should say so. It's hilarious. Next, we have Noa, who was literally raised by wolves (well, a Seru creature attached to a wolf's head). Because of this, she is socially awkward and knows nothing of the world. Unfortunately, this leads to some pretty cringe-worthy dialogue (for example, a scene where she broadly proclaims that suffering is bad!). To make matters worse, she speaks the most out of your three characters. Gala is your last character. I actually think he is the best developed since he starts out being an uptight stiff but later becomes more open-minded. Overall, these characters are not the greatest, but they get the job done.Story (score 9/10): You'd think a game about reviving trees to save the world would be boring, but this game pulls it off. An evil mist has covered the land, causing the normally helpful Seru creatures to attack humanity. Your small party of heroes possess Ra-Seru, a type of Seru immune to the mist, and must save the world by reviving Genesis Trees, which have the power to drive away mist. No, this isn't Arbor Day propaganda. In all seriousness, though, the story is pretty engaging. It's really interesting seeing how each isolated settlement of humans manages to protect themselves from the mist and who is ultimately responsible for the whole mist problem. The game developers have really done a good job of portraying a devastation-ridden world and keeping it engaging and believable.Battle System (score 10/10): The battle system is an interesting take on the usual turn-based system. You input a left, right, up, or down button in a string to make an attack. Certain combinations will be special attacks called arts which do more damage. If you get sick of inputting buttons, the game allows you to use your last input as a default. This option can speed things up if you just don't feel like doing all those inputs. This battle system is actually more fun and engaging than a plain old attack command, and I really enjoyed it.Gameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me. Now, the best aspect of this game, in my opinion, is collecting Seru to use as summon magic. If you have a collector's mindset like me, you'll really enjoy collecting them all. Unfortunately, this can be tedious and irritating since you odds of catching good Seru are usually low, forcing you to try over and over and over again. This really wears on your nerves after awhile. Usually though, it isn't so bad. Let's see, other than that, no complaints!Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score. It's really a shame that this game isn't more well-known because I feel like Legend of Legaia is a good solid little game. If you're an RPG collector then this game is definitely worth putting in your collection.",4,"A Good, Solid RPG!",1251331200,"08 27, 2009",0.1063
9,A1EHPSG1JK3C0V,B00000IM2T,Jeff Brugamyer,"[0, 0]","Legend of Legaia was the first rpg I ever played which started my love for rpg's. When I first played this game I could not put it down to eat, sleep or go to work. I called in 2 days in a row because of how addicted to this game I was. Anyways, to get to the review part and after beating this game 3x since and played many rpg's it still holds as one of my all time favorites just under Lunar:SSSC, Final Fantasy VII, Grandia and Xenogears for the original playstation.Storyline: I still after all these years love the storyline to this game. Van, Gala and Noa are the only members in your party (which after playing other rpg's, I wished you had a few more people in your party). Basically there is a mist that turns people and animals into crazed monsters and you need to activate the Genesis trees and destroy mist generators. It has some really good twists in the story and it stays for the most part intersesting and keeps you hooked. Van is a quiet and just good all around guy, Noa is a girl who grew up on her own until she met Van and Gala is a monk who seems to be angry most of the time.Graphics: Definitely for its time some of the best around but there were no cg clips or fmv's to help move the storyline on. With games around its time using cg clips, like FFVII, or anime scenes like Lunar, I think Legaia could have used some clips as well. As far as graphics when your characters were fighting, very nicely done, a bit blocky but when you buy armor and the change is actually noticeable on the character its a very easy to get over.Combat System: Probably the very best thing and most enjoyable part of the game, even the random battles are easy to get over because it actually get you into the fight. You get to do whats called arts, hyper arts and magic that is used through your Ra-Seru. Magic is learned by killing monsters but getting the actual spell is random so it can be on your first kill or 200th kill. The power of your magic goes up the more times you use it and the Kamero spell is easily my most favorite.The game can take anywhere from 50+ hours to finish depending on how much you do. There are a few mini games but none that are noteworthy and I only have few gripes about the game itself.The first is when roaming around on the world map Van moves really slow. Also, money is an annoyance to get and armor starts getting really expensive so you'll spend a lot of time money grinding if you want the best stuff.The money grinding, lack of a few cg clips or fmv's to help move the story and long levels keep this game from being one of the greatest rpg's ever.

Man discovered that he could use these benevolent creatures to wield tremendous powers. All was well. Or as well as it could be in a world where war was a commonplace and, sooner or later, someone figured out how to pervert the power of the Seru and turn them to evil. Those who wore the Seru became degenerate, and the world cowered before the onslaught of the mist.Of course, the powers that write games couldn't leave an opportunity like this alone, and our heroes, Vahn the young hunter, Gala the monk, and Noa, an eleven year old girl with the power of 10 were packed off to end the mist, wearing special symbionts, the Ra-Seru. Their first task, to restore the great trees of the world.This is a classic PS-One RPG. Not one of the greatest, but with enough play in it to keep your interest for the 40 to 60 hours it takes to play. The story line is straightforward - the long story arc is broken into a set of subquests, either the restoration of a tree or the destruction of a mist generator. The world is large, and you will spend a lot of time walking about in perpetual battle until faster modes of tranportation become available.The battle system is based on combination attacks which can be layered together in increasing power. Magic is available via the Ra-Seru, who can absorb powers when certain foes are beaten. Like many systems, fighting can be as complex as you might like, but the truth is that you will find certain patterns that work consistently and those are what you will use. This is a flaw in most RPG's - power always trumps subtlety.The game's only glaring flaw is that it is entirely too much a money game. You start out poor and stay that way, since no matter how many you kill, your funds always lag the prices until late in the game, when a variety of sub-games become available to generate cash and prizes. There is something vaguely unsatisfying about putting saving the world on hold in order to go 30 round in a boxing ring to get the cash for that nifty magic grail. Now every RPG has this problem, but in Legaia it is worse than usual.My other gripe is the characters. Vahn and Gala are extremely two dimensional (Gala has a slight sense of humor). Noa, who gets most of the story development time, is a hyperactive, bloodthirsty eleven-year-old girl who is perpetually waving her arms and giving orders. She is also a stone killer. She may get my prize as the silliest hero to grace the Playstation.Graphics are decent for the game's era, but music is a washout. This is a decent game, with fairly enjoyable play, but don't expect Final Fantasy level quality.

13,AK1OBVI54SY73,B00000IM2T,Rocky Raquel,"[0, 0]","And this is coming from someone who has played so many other RPG games including the very impressive Legend of Dragoon and also of course the famous Final Fantasy games.The characters for one are quite memorable. Let's take Noa first. She eventually will become, if not your strongest, then second strongest in the entire group. Her speed is superior over the men's and thus makes her deliver some hard hits. She became my best fighter and unlike others she was my favorite character. Many here say that Noa is annoying but honestly people she was raised her whole life in a cave without any human contact. Of course she doesn't understand how to behave in public how could she? So I think reviewers should cut the game some slack with her since they're just trying to make her realistic.Gala is a great fighter due to his body strength. He eventually hits the hardest and does great damage to the enemies. Gala himself is a rather interesting character as well. At first he doesn't warm up to either Vahn and Noa, but only because of his extreme dislike for seru and anyone who wears them. When he finds out how special Ra- Seru though, he warms up and becomes a willing and actually humorous character.Vahn is the one you have to control. He only speaks what you choose for him to say but everyone loves him. He's the nice guy and a good fighter as well. He's not as quick as Noa, or as strong as Gala, but nonetheless when you get his levels up he can be a great fighter as well.Now for the game itself, it is a very fun, and long game. If you're not patient enough to last through a long video game then you better steer clear of this game. It took me 70 hours to finish it and that's mainly because every town that was filled with the Mist I stuck around before saving it to level up a bit more. Some people I notice complain of how hard the bosses are. I found none of the bosses truly hard at all- even the final boss I did not break a sweat over. Maybe because I have played so many other RPGs that they were easy, but I think even someone not really into RPGs could easily beat the bosses of the game. It's just I think a lot of people didn't level up as much as they should have. At the very end of the game I was at level 52 for my group and that was more than enough for me to beat the game.Leveling up can be a pain once all three characters get to higher levels, but the bosses are easy to beat as long as you level up a few in every Mist- filled town. So I advise gamers to do so. Also leveling up the magic creatures your Ra- Seru takes in as is very easy and necessary- just use them frequently in battle and they will easily level up in no time.Also it is smart to level up anyway to get a lot of money. Because I do agree with one complaint- the weapons in this game cost a lot of money eventually. I think the point is to fight a lot so you don't have a money problem- but I do agree the weapons still, especially towards the end of the game, get to be too pricey. Just fight a bit, or even sell an accessory you don't wear, and you will eventually find the money for them.The plot and subplots of this game is what keeps you overall entertained. I won't repeat what the Amazon review already has wrote out so well, but the basic goal throughout the game is to destroy the Mist all over the world by reviving Genesis trees and destroying Mist generators. Along the way many interesting characters come along and you fight a few and help a few.The best part of the game is definitely the outfits though the three get to wear. The new weapons and armor they wear are always different in appearance and visually appealing. Noa's outfits are especially beautiful. It's worth the money I think to pay for them.So overall this is a long and very creative game. The storylines throughout the game connect well and the plot itself unravels well as you go along. The characters are likeable and as said before the battle scenes are visually appealing and fun. The levels do take awhile as you get up to higher numbers, but you do not need at all to get anywhere near level 99. As said before, I beat the game easily at level 52. I would say the only really minor negative parts are the long levels and amount of money for armor- other than that, this game is a true joy.

I know that it had it faults, but it wasn't that bad and it was pretty fun. I liked the drawings of characters and the animation. If you like FF7 kind of graphics than this is the same kind. I like the battle system. Yes, this game has a similar battle system as Xenogears and that's why I liked it too. It's not a bad thing that they used a similar battle system, it's a great thing, as now I got 2 games that play the same with different people and story lines.The main story is that you control 3 characters and they all have a magic gem that attach to their arm. This give them the ability to use magic/summon spells. I remember as a little kid, I loved seeing those spells come out. The fault in this game with that is it takes awhile to get the spells. You have to get hit repeatedly with the same spell for awhile before the each character learns it.Another issue with this game is that their is a issue with money. I had to fight many battles before I could get enough to buy anything. It's like this for the whole game. I didn't mind this as I had to fight monster anyways to learn those summon spells.What I really liked about this game was the little mini games. I remember playing one mini game for a long time as the fishing game. I remember there was 2 or 3 places where I could fish and I had to get better rods to get better fish. I would keep on fishing for some reason I would get something for getting a fish that weight a lot of pounds. Also, I would get something for getting really rare fish. I remember one time, I got the most impossible and rarest fish in the whole game. It took half a hour of reeling it in and even longer trying to find and wait for it. That sucker was so much trouble to get, but I knew it was worth it.

The #1 reason I love this game is the execution of the Super, Hyper, and Miracle arts. I have a few other reasons but I'm only listing the first one.",5,BEST PSone GAME EVER!!!!!,1260835200,"12 15, 2009",0.6083

Rhodes,"[2, 2]","In 1999 everyone had gotten all excited about Final Fantasy VIII (what a mistake that was) while THIS game would be the one to keep RPGers satisfied until then. While it clearly isn't that remarkable for the new generation, Legend of Legaia was every RPGers dream. A rich well thought out Battle system with an excellent storyline to boot. Not only that but the game was extremely difficult. A vast world full of sidequests and mini games as well as one of the hardest optional bosses in RPG HISTORY!First the graphics. This was probably one of the last RPGs made to use the blocky polygons, but the graphics were exquisite. Especially in battle. When seeing characters in battle the game actually viewed your characters in full armor! If you took armor off and placed on a different armor it showed! When did Final Fantasy do THAT? Outside of battle the graphics are colorful and towns are nice and easy to navigate.Now for what I think made Legend of Legaia pretty interesting as far as RPGs go. The battle system was probably one of the best battle systems I saw. First you selected to fight in a battle. Then with each character you selected several chains to connect together to form a combo (think of Street Fighter). You watch them perform the combo and do an art technique that consumed AP. The only way to gain your AP back was to be attacked, attack without using arts or to select a command called &quot;Spirit&quot; (which replaces what we often call &quot;Defend&quot; or &quot;Guard&quot;). The only flaw with this system? Well gaining AP takes longer than it actually sounds and for that battles get to be VERY long. Boss battles can take as long as an hour because of this.The storyline is that God created humans. But the humans were unable to fend off monsters that covered the land. So God gave them a power in which to aid them. It was called the seru. Humans grew reliable on Seru and began to do things that they otherwise couldn't do. Things such as fly, or become incredibly strong. But one day that came to an end when out of nowhere the mist covers the land in which the humans live on. The mist causes the seru to go insane and attack the humans casuing disaster in the land of Legaia. Thus the Legend begins!Learning magic wasn't entirely original but it was different from what I was used to. You were bestowed with a Ra-Seru and when you attacked certain enemies they would either die or they would turn into a magic spell for you to keep. This was a great idea but learning magic is very annoying at times when you must fight the same enemies over and over again.My cons with the game. The character developement is pretty bad. The characters don't act their age. It's nice that they have a background on them though. So I guess these characters are developed in some ways but they're very unbelievable. The other con is that while the game is difficult it get's disturbingly easy as you go through...well somewhat. EVERY MOMENT in this game before the Final Boss is really hard...then you get to that final boss and he's so incredibly easy. Another bad thing about the game is that there is this hidden boss named Lapis who does several points of damage to you. This is one of the hardest bosses in Legend of Legaia and possibly RPG history. What makes it bad though is that the reward for defeating him is nothing special so of course defeating the boss is only for bragging rights.The music in this game is superb. The moment is always set and the music makes you feel as if you're in a fantasy. A type of music that I don't always get. The game is also full of mini games and sidequests as well. Not only that but the way the story unfolds is by far one of the best ways to tell this kind of story. At first it seems like a cliche but it's much more than that.OverallThe good+INCREDIBLE Battle system+Great story+Cool grapchis+Great music+Lots of mini games and sidequests+A hard game+An epic adventureThe bad-Stuff is too expensive (Not mentioned above)-Characters lack-Battles can get really long.",5,AWESOMELY ORIGINAL!,1063238400,"09 11, 2003",-0.0224
