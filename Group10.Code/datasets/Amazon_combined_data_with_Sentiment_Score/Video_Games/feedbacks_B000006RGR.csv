Deskins WVBullrider,"[2, 3]",this game lacked the ability to live up to name Tomb Raider its more of a City Raider half the levels deal with city-time scenery. and 80% of the enemies are humans. more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities (Venice) so i cant complain too much - just wasnt feelin the whole China scene. I liked to level skip those. and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week. just run around and jump for the most part.,5,imma critic with this one...,1151107200,"06 24, 2006",0.2098
1,A3HTX1NOTTWERP,B000006RGR,Busy Body,"[13, 14]","Tomb Raider 2 is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of all-time! I bought the game in December 1997, around the same time I got my PlayStation. But I never really liked Tomb Raider 2 and only managed to get halfway through the first level, before forgetting about it for a while. Four years later, in the summer of 2001, I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide. What a shock I got!After the phenomenal, worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November 1996, the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel, which, in a rare case, surpasses the original with flying colours. To save the game in the first, you had to find a crystal before continuing, wheras in Tomb Raider 2 you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like. This comes as a great help, especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes. Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game. The first game featured Pistols, Shotgun and Uzis - that was about it. But with this game, you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M-16 Assault Rifle. While Tomb Raider 1 focused more on enemies in animal form, Tomb Raider 2 has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human. But the most notable change on Tomb Raider 2 is the welcome addition of vehicles. Tomb Raider featured none what so ever, but Tomb Raider 2 has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills. Lara also took advantage of a make-over. The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game, but Lara herself has changed a lot; her hair is no longer tied in a bun, but flows freely down her back in a pony tail. The reason this wasn't featured in the first game is because the technology wasn't good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail - they couldn't get it to move in motion with her body (rather silly when you think about it now). Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces. The improved engine also served better lighting facilities, which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas. When it comes to the levels, the highlights are Venice, Offshore Rig, Tibetian Foothills (short but sweet - involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key, before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level), Barkhang Monastery (HINT: Whatever you do, DON'T shoot the monks, they are here to help! They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you don't have to kill them! Accidently shoot one, and you'll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you!) and Temple of Xian.OVERALL GRADE: 10/10Tomb Raider 2 is, in my opinion, the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been. Yes, the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since - especially on the PlayStation 2 and X-Box, but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is. And in that category, it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever. Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably. Buy this now from Amazon - it'd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all time...",5,The Best PlayStation Game Of All Time!,1032998400,"09 26, 2002",0.1682

These games are still great for people looking for a challenge, but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order, as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next, as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But, even though there isn't as much actual &#34;Tomb Raiding&#34; in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game.

3,A28R83ADQPMF2X,B000006RGR,Chris W.,"[2, 2]","From the Great Wall of China to the canals of Venice, Tomb Raider II is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original. In fact, I find this game to be my favorite of the series. In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion. In her quest she navigates the globe, and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds.Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original, and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series. The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence. Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions, they still are quite difficult. Lara has new moves, many new weapons, and more dangerous foes. What more could a Tomb Raider fan - or even the casual gamer - ask for?I highly recommend this game, whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series. I don't believe you will be disappointed - in fact, you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment. And if you do enjoy it, I strongly recommend other games in this series.",5,The Best Game in an Outstanding Series,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",0.2415

This one at least let you safe the progress anywhere in the game without looking for any type of save crystals which made original game incredibly difficult and punishing. This sequel may not be the best game out there for the PS1 but at least it's a bit more fun to play.,3,A better game than the original,1236729600,"03 11, 2009",0.6498

6,APS7IH14C8AZ9,B000006RGR,M. King The super mario nerd,"[0, 0]","I recently started re-playing this game to find that it is actually quite fun. I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention. I just thought of it to be boring and hard. But since i remembered it, i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure, keep it. So i did. Anyways, when i started it up, i remembered everything about the first mission, very hard especially without anymore ps1 memory cards. When i finally beat the first mission. The Wall It sadly took me hours, because after those tumbling rocks after you, you got ran over easy and died. Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission, so this is what took me the most time. Soon i got on to the second mission, i got pretty far but then the disc old and scratched up quit on me. It kept freezing. I have had this problem many times before on the first mission, so i had to restart it back up again. After that i pretty much quit. This is why i keep all of my games in their cases. So they will work about 10 years later. Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing, well the missions in speedy time. And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were. I really enjoyed this game, well the first couple missions of it. So maybe i will buy a ps1 memory card and start to savin' soon.",5,Tomb Raider II,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",0.0198
7,A1HAL6ZQ8MUJSD,B000006RGR,mr_bunghole,"[6, 6]","The first Tomb Raider was a classic in terms of its 3D gameplay, sense of exploration through massive levels, and a unique main character. The 2nd installment in the TR series is not much different. The levels are still HUGE, and exploration is still the name of the game. But this time around, the environments and enemies are more varied, there are more action-based enemy sequences than the first, and the difficulty level has been approriately increased. In terms of the level of challenge, I feel that this is the best in the series. The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times. This one is definitely not a cakewalk, but is very possible without a strategy guide. You don't feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room. Progress is slow, but steady, and you don't ever need 6 or 7 different items to move on. Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches. Some of the level designs are incredible, such as the Venice-based levels, the Opera House, the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian. This is the key strength of the first two TR installments, and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring. Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key, as medipacks are in light supply in this game. Also, every level has 3 secrets in the form of dragons. You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all 3 dragons in the level, making exploration even more vital in building your inventory. Finding at least 2 of the dragons in every level should be quite easy, but some levels have one especially well-hidden dragon. The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult, but the reward of finding them (especially the first one) is worth it. If you didn't like the first Tomb Raider, this game won't change your mind. If you were blown away by the first installment (or even the 3rd, 4th or 5th) then this game is a real treat.",5,Still holds up,1045526400,"02 18, 2003",0.1793

10,A1OMDXD8O3XT57,B000006RGR,Nate Brooks,"[0, 7]","I was only 5 years old my first time playing this game back in Christmas of 1997. I was never able to get past the first couple levels then. But I always loved this game. It was magic back then. The graphics were also great THEN. Second time around, I was 12 and it was 2004. I was able to finally finish the entire game and find all the secrets to. Now in 2012, I had the urge to replay this game again. To get those feeling of being so young. I'm 19, and the magic is completely gone, and for ONE REASON.BE WARNED...... if you have a full HD TV and have a PS3, and bought a physical copy of this game......the playback visuals of this game will be absolutely HORRIBLE! It completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because EVERYTHING is so pixelated if you will. Like I NEVER remembered this game looking so bad before, but I have to assume it had always looked this way but I was in a different era of technology then. HD TVs are completely unforgiving to these types of games. I'm not sure if the the digital copy available on the PSN is any better, but the actual physical copy is not meant for a HD display even in it respective aspect ratio. Maybe just playing this game on standard definition TV might help, but I haven't tried that either. I will just have to remember the game like when I was young as the best PS1 game I ever played and then later the only one I ever beat.

12,AK1OBVI54SY73,B000006RGR,Rocky Raquel,"[3, 3]","A major Tomb Raider fan, I decided to play all the games over again and finished both part one and now part two and they're both still as great as I remember. I think both are strong and worthwhile games with great plots but Tomb Raider Two is more tough, but that's the point of a sequel. It's longer (or at least it felt that way, especially when it came to the Ocean part of the game) yet I enjoyed playing it.Both Tomb Raider One and Two have interesting plots and both are different. In Tomb Raider Two it has to deal with a Dagger that throughout the story grows more important to find and soon. You go through many different levels than you did on Tomb Raider one- including the Floating Islands- which is one weird level but very fascinating. My favorite levels were in Venice, the places in Tibet and yes the Floating Islands. Home Sweet Home level was a little scary- being attacked in her own home!- but I thought it was a good twist. The ending itself was tougher than the first one that's for sure, and I did say a few curse words while trying to finish the game, but eventually when I did finish I knew that it was worthwhile. I had to get a strategy guide nonetheless to beat this game, because indeed in many levels it was a little too tough for me to figure out, but then there's no shame in getting a little help.Overall the game is more hard and challenging and just as creative in plot as part one was (the storylines are way good).
