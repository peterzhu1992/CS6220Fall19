0,AAPFN1BADMWMC,B00000J060,Giancarlo Croce Offer VOID where prohibited,"[9, 9]","This is a simple, no frills, no gimmicks radio. Believe it or not, it was hard to find a radio with those qualities. Modern radios are teeny-tiny, and have tons of &quot;features&quot;. I needed this radio for someone who was visually impaired, had severe arthritis, and was well beyond the age of dealing with multi-functional gadgets. Fortunately (?) GE is still in the business of making things &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;.To me, the GE brand has always meant &quot;cheaply made&quot;. To be fair, it once meant superior quality and cutting-edge innovation, but GE along with General Motors and a few other &quot;Super Conglomerates&quot;, took a vacation from quality and innovation in the latter half of the last century. Now they're madly playing catch-up, and this little radio, even though it's a throwback, is the first sign I've seen that they're making progress.It's a simple am/fm radio. It's a little too bulky, has very nice monoraural sound, and the knobs are a bit too small for arthritic fingers. Still, it's just what I needed, and it's the first GE product I've intentionally purchased in over thirty years. Either my standards are coming down, or they're actually improving their quality.",4,I'm not really a snob,1082332800,"04 19, 2004",0.1214

2,A1U6C4G5YT51E,B00000J060,Jeanette Stingley,"[0, 0]","I was looking around for a small radio to have at my desk at work. I figured with a smaller unit, I would save space and not have a very good sound. I was wrong about this unit. I was very pleased to listen to the quality of sound from this unit. 2 people that sit near me in my office have enjoyed this radio as well and have ordered one for themselves as well. I highly recommend this product. It is a good price, small, and has a great sound.",5,"Little radio, a lot of sound",1173312000,"03 8, 2007",0.3907
3,A22Y586YTVSY10,B00000J060,MP - Middle of the Pacific,"[0, 0]",I wanted a radio to listen to NPR for a few minutes in the morning without putting on the stereo. I did not want a CD or tape player. This is a good little basic radio and I am pleased with it.,5,Good little basic radio,1140048000,"02 16, 2006",0.2144
4,A2V8VLTPY3W01E,B00000J060,P.J. O'Tuama,"[8, 8]","I bought this for listening to NPR while working on painting and stenciling projects on our backporch. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it does a good job with music as well as spoken words. I also like the fact that it has a solid, metal antenna instead of one of those thin, whispy wire ones that so interest the feline members of our household (my husband recently bought a clock radio with one of those antennas -- after two days it was summarily detached and removed to the living room for the 2000 Antenna Olympics). Another nice feature is the little compartment in back in which you can store the electrical cord.",5,great little radio!,968544000,"09 10, 2000",0.5043
5,A3UXU4YM508ZEA,B00000J060,Randy Remote,"[5, 5]","This radio might work better if you live in areas with strong radio signals. In the fringe area I live in, it doesn't work at all,whereas the little ten dollar Panasonic RF-P50 Pocket AM / FM Radio works quite well.",1,Poor Reception,1135555200,"12 26, 2005",0.5367
6,AC8E3L5ZM01P,B00000J060,Timothy B. Dereg,"[8, 8]","I needed a cheap radio for background music. All I wanted was decent sound and to receive FM radio. I wasn't interested in playing CDs or MP3s. Since I do a lot of work around the homestead, I wanted it to be small and easily portable and still have decent sound. This GE radio delivers on all counts. I live rurally but still close enough to town that I can't comment on long-distance reception. All I can say is that I get all the radio stations that I want to listen to, the quality of the speaker is plenty good enough for my taste and level of loudness in FM music, and I don't get any frequency drift so that I don't have to constantly fiddle with the tuning knob. It's just a great little radio for a very decent price. The only downside is that the FM antenna is quite flimsy and can be all-too-easily bent if you knock the radio over with the antenna extended.",5,Great sound for such an inexpensive radio,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",0.0864
