0,A12TAFRBBG9EI6,B00000J0D2,Adam Resnick Adam R,"[1, 1]","Excellent product while it lasts. I have yet to have one of these last for more than four months. I usually purchase a few at time so that I always have a spare for when ever it no longer works. Because the telephone is so uncomfortable to hold, a handset is a necessity and this is the best one to have. Unfortunately, it does not last for too long.",3,Uniden HS910 Headset for Cordless Phones,1181174400,"06 7, 2007",0.0293
1,A12T2YJDP004C2,B00000J0D2,Bill Gaston,"[1, 1]",I've owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless. This unit fits well and the sound quality I hear is superb. I've asked those I've talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear. Guess I'd have to give it a total of five stars.,5,The best unit I've had so far,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",0.1043

I have used Plantronics plastic tube-type microphones at work and the sound quality was better the sister said.It was weird to have a very lightweight headset on my head -- instead of a phone clenched between my head and shoulder. But! I knew it was something I could learn to love quickly.The mike was not quite long enough however... call me a big mouth! It didn't reach around in front of my face. It was very much to the side. Just in the peripheral vision... again something I was sure I could get accustomed to.But. The next time I plugged it in, if I touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling. I gave up after a few more tries. I should of sent it back (Amazon is SUPER about replacing items) but didn't really think about it until the warranty had expired.I am ready to try again. But this time will read all the reviews before purchasing.",1,No sale,974937600,"11 23, 2000",0.2008
3,A6EFPNEQVKUUJ,B00000J0D2,George Woodard His Geekness,"[8, 8]",There appears to be an engineering flaw in the plug connection for the microphone wire. I have two of these units where you can hear the caller but they cant hear you. This is too bad because the sound quality is very good for the price.,1,Can you hear me?

4,A3KE44SZHUFBP1,B00000J0D2,Love2Read,"[0, 0]",The only thing it was missing is the volume slider with mute button. I had it on the previous Uniden headset. Otherwise it works great and I am happy with the 3 I bought.,4,Pretty good for the money,1377043200,"08 21, 2013",0.1785
5,A36890902KUCK5,B00000J0D2,N. K. Peterson Nostalgic-Buff,"[0, 0]",Headset is comfortable and works well. I can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help. Only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphone.,4,Great to be hands free,1273881600,"05 15, 2010",0.4793
6,A6CXO60VYUKL9,B00000J0D2,Richc,"[0, 0]",This is a great headset. The volume is just a little lower than I would have expected but overall I am very happy with this headset and I would buy another if I had the need.,5,Great Headst,1255824000,"10 18, 2009",0.6732
7,A1OA1WF8AOR39T,B00000J0D2,Russell Dicker,"[70, 75]","I decided I wanted a headset so that I could talk on the phone while doing work or cooking around my house. I looked at both this Uniden headset and the AT&amp;T one that is also sold on Amazon. Even though I read the reviews on here that said this headset can easily break I went ahead and bought one for cheap off the Amazon.com Outlet. I used it for a few months and was pretty happy with it. It was comfortable on my head, easy to adjust, sounded good, and I never got any complaints from people I was talking to.Then it broke.So now I'm about to shell out some more money for the AT&amp;T headset and I figured I'd share my new found wisdom with everyone else.",2,Don't make my mistake,965865600,"08 10, 2000",0.449
8,A30UV3IIH7IJF,B00000J0D2,R. Yankura yanko,"[1, 3]","I purchased this for my wife to use when she speaks to a certain someone each night and puts the phone on the speaker system. The only probem is that my wife wears one of these all day and was not happy to wear this at home. I used it a few time when I work on my computer and need help. Sound quality is fine. If I had to do over, I might have looked into a wireless. Don't get me wrong, it works fine. It's that I don't really need it with my speaker phones.",4,Nothing special,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",0.134
9,A3DJ8DG0WPNXQA,B00000J0D2,tzm,"[0, 0]","This is the worst headset I have ever owned. I bought so many of them over the years I don't remember anymore how many went bad. At least 10. The reason I keep buying them is because all other manufacturer headsets don't work well with a Uniden cordless phone. Uniden requires a specific impedance, otherwise voice quality is not good.Calling Uniden is worthless. They are of no help.I actually think they design the tip of the connector to break because each one has stopped working properly where the wire connects to the 2.5mm plug.I'm not buying anymore Uniden phones or headsets.",1,Garbage.
