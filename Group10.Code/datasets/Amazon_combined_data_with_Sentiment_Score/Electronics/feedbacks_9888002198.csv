0,A2JAGOIH2DZAN,9888002198,Amazon Customer,"[19, 19]","Just got back from a week in London and Paris. I used this adapter to power my HP laptop and I used it's built-in USB port to charge my Blackberry Bold, iPhone 3GS, and iPod Touch with no problems at all. The built-in lights are really handy. The power light lets you know it's plugged into a working AC wall plug. I found that not all plugs in the Chicago and Houston airports are working, so having the light was really handy for finding a working outlet. The second, USB, light gets brighter or dimmer as power is pulled by the USB device. For example; when my Blackberry was plugged in and recharging, the light glowed somewhat dimmly, but when I made a call, the light glowed more brightly. So you can tell when you have a good connection to your USB device.Overall, it's well built and easy to operate. I'll be keeping this in my travel bag.",4,Worked great,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",0.2589

I sent it with a gift to someone in the UK.Item is finished well, the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly. Came with instructions and carrying pouch.Only trouble I had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computer's power cord plug into the AC receptacle. Very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it. Much easier after that.The USB slot and its light worked, but the second light for the AC receptacle did not. However, the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through it.The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged. Also, another switch was shown in the instruction diagram (I don't remember what it was supposed to be for) that wasn't on the adapter.Recipient uses the USB slot to charge a camera and MP3 player and reports it is working fine for those devices. Thrilled to have the EU plug too.If it lasts, great product and VERY cost effective.",4,good item,1357344000,"01 5, 2013",0.1847
2,ATXRV6Z3N08ZX,9888002198,Buckeye_Knight,"[2, 2]","I purchased 2 Universal Travel AC Wall Adapters, with USB Charger, for my daughters' trips to Europe. Both units worked for about 1 day or less, when they stopped working during use. They used them with dual voltage camera battery chargers. I had also given them straight plug adapters. Thank God that I did! The straight plug adapters, which I bought in 1999, still worked, and lasted them the rest of the trip. Good thing I also included USB charger units. So they could not charge 2 items at the same time, since the new wall adapters broke, but they got their gadgets charged with the other plugs.I put in a request to return these to the seller (HandHelditems). And they did NOT honor it because I bought it a few months back, but the kids' trips were not until the past few weeks. I guess I should have tried them out after we first got them.",1,Defective,1373328000,"07 9, 2013",0.0647
3,A2OHGA790ZR35V,9888002198,Darren Leung,"[54, 54]","This product does NOT deserve the 2 stars the other reviewers gave it. One reviewer got the wrong product, apparently (which has to do with the seller), while the other doesn't seem to realize that the USB port is for charging peripherals, NOT a computer.Pros:-has basically all plug adapters you need built-in or easily removable.-compact-sturdy, good quality plastic, kind of like Lego-decent USB power port rated at 500mA-lights for AC Power and USB powerCons:-does not ground-instructions say 110V-250V, but unit says 100-250V. Should work in Japan, but haven't tested it.Notes:*Do not pay full price at a retailer for this item! I got mine from the seller in this listing. It was delivered in a simple bubble-envelope with instruction sheet, no maim-shell packaging.*I LOVE the lights on this thing. You can plug in and know right away if there is AC.*Furthermore, the USB lights up depending on the current being drawn and thus flickers when something is trickle-charging. Know what this means? It means you can tell AT A GLANCE if your device is 95% charged!!! Do NOT top-off your battery-powered devices to 100%! The memory effect is a myth. The real culprit is topping-off your battery. Charge your devices until the USB flickers and then remove them.*keep in mind that, as with all modern plug converters, your primary device must be rated to use 100-250V mains power. This adapter will NOT step-up or step-down voltage (unnecessary with modern electronics).The only possible improvements to this would be if there was an extra USB port or if it was somehow rotatable.This thing kicks ASS and is a great bargain compared to the other name-brand junk out there that is either over-priced or over-priced AND doesn't have USB power.",5,Can't really ask for much more.,1263168000,"01 11, 2010",0.0597

I usually charge my laptop and iPod touch in this at the same time and have not had problems with it so far. It also has all of its individual parts for the various plugs it is capable of fitting in all contained within itself, which is very handy because you don't have to remember where you put the EU plug or the US plug, etc!",5,Awesome,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",0.275
6,AA6BJGZG6XI05,9888002198,E. Moore,"[0, 0]","These were a life-saver! I bought 2 of these and I was a little unsure of the quality based on the price of this item, but was pleasantly surprised by how well it worked for me over 6 weeks in Europe and UK. Stayed in over 22 hotels and on a train sleeper car and never had a problem. I travel with a CPAP breathing machine and it was critical to have power every night so I could sleep. I also had an iPhone and my brother had an iPad and the USB charger was great for both. I could also use one plug to both power the CPAP and charge the iPhone. It was really nice to have the red lights that indicated that you had power since many outlets in Europe and UK have some sort of switch that turns the power off to each individual outlet. Also, on the train, the red light wast coming on and let me know that the outlet wasn't working. I worked with the conductor to get some circuit breakers on the train reset by letting him know when the red light came back on. That was quite a time saver and great tool for that purpose.The only negative I have is that the part that holds the US plug into the device could be a little more snug. It felt like it was going to fall out at times (and did fallout 1-2 times but that wasn't much over 6 weeks of use).There is one design enhancement that I would have put into this device: When using the UK converter, they could have made the bottom of the device a 2nd 110 outlet so that you would have 2 110 outlets (the regular one on the back and one on the bottom using the Euro converter) as well as the USB outlet. Of course this may be over the amperage that one plug should carry, but it's a thought for the designers.",5,Worked for 6 weeks in Europe and UK,1341446400,"07 5, 2012",0.2127

It's compact, has all kinds of adapters, and very lightweight -- seemed perfect for travel. My first night in Italy, it plugged right in and charged both my camera battery (in regular outlet) and ipad (using the USB port). Unfortunately, after the 2nd night, there were faint black burn marks on the white plastic and it failed to charge anything else after that. Burnt out after just 2 nights? In short, great idea but very little durability.",1,Great for the few days it worked.,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",0.0928

10,A2GCVUZ1N1TBZ2,9888002198,jhl,"[10, 10]","Once upon a time I travelled with a heavy current converter and a handful of plugs to fit a variety of sockets outside the U.S., all in a bulky case. Now that so many electrical devices have dual voltage, the issue is to find a convenient plug adapter, and this one fits the bill. It's very cleverly designed so that all the plugs snap together into a single compact unit - no more lost parts! - and it has the added benefit of a USB port for charging MP3 players & the like. Add to that a super-reasonable price, and I don't know how you could ask for more.",5,Well designed,1266710400,"02 21, 2010",0.3273

I really like the extra USB plugs. They work so well that I no longer carry an extra AC to USB adapter. It does have an internal fuse that cannot be replaced, but I have yet to encounter a problem.I plan to get another one.NOTE.. This is only an adapter, not a voltage converter. Most outlets outside of the USA are 220. So be sure what you plug in is duel voltage. Most cell phone chargers and laptops are duel voltage.EDIT: I've uploaded some pictures, please feel free to view.",5,Works Perfectly,1299024000,"03 2, 2011",0.2592
13,A3N4QU9537CZ5O,9888002198,Quentin Spencer,"[2, 2]","We have two of these and recently used them in both Ireland and Sweden. It includes plugs for UK, US, European, and Australian style plugs. Contrary to what one other reviewer says here, it does really support Australian plugs. To use it on an Australian outlet with the angled slots, just twist the blades of the US plug.The fuse in one of ours was blown while trying to run a hair dryer on it. I have removed the fuse and ordered replacements. When I get it working again, I'll post an update. It is marked as a 3 A, 250 V fast blowing fuse, which means that this is rated for about 750 W. That's about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer, so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question, but it's more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry.The red indicator LEDs are helpful to know that it's working, but they are fairly bright, so if bright LEDs in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping, plan ahead to cover them up with something.Update: I replaced the blown fuse with one of these:QUALITY USA brand fuses!! Set of 5 pieces, 3AG3A250V, F3AL250V, F3A 250V, F3 L250V, F3A 250V, F3L250V cartridge GLASS fuses 6X30mm (1/4 in x 1-1/4 in) , 3A 250V, Fast-blow (Fast Acting).

I'm not sure what the two red lights were supposed to be for but I never saw either of them turn on either.

At other times I use it to charge my kindle, backup batteries, camera and cellphone.I wish I had purchased 2 so I can use more than one outlet at a time. I did bring along an extension cord, but adding more than one gadget to it slows down the charging rate. Using 2 outlets is more efficient.
