I do not fall into this category, but, I was responsible for getting a VCR to work. The old one was eating tapes, received a new one from a friend. Didn't chew up tapes, but it only showed a quick 2 seconds of a tape, then everything was garbled beyond recognition. No matter how much I played with the tracking, it did not improve. Ran the Maxell VCR cleaner through a few times, seemed like a slight improvement. Ignored the direction and instead of putting the fluid through the hole, applied generous amounts directly on the tape ribbon. Put it back in the VCR, ran it a few more times, BINGO, works again.I read other reviews saying this was not the original Maxell VCR cleaner. It seems like it is to me, but bottom line, I could care less, it worked. I will say this though, if you want to convert precious home movies to DVD/digital from VHS, don't use an old VCR. This improved the VCR by magnitudes, but in my opinion, it's not going to be as good as new VCR's that are made specifically for converting and compensating bad track.

Do not order the CleanDR 60128 VHS video head cleaning system just because it is cheaper than this brand. The CleanDR shows a bottle of fluid and describes it as a wet system, but it is not.

This started again shortly after purchasing a second VCR to replace one doing the same thing which replaced two previously-owned, older units doing the same thing. There had to be something else. So, after checking all my connections and cables, I purchased this head cleaner. After adding the included cleaning liquid, I ran it for about 25-30 seconds.
