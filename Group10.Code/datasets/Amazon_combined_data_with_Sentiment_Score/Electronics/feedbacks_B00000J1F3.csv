1,A1QVS34FWGRAVG,B00000J1F3,A. MacGregor,"[1, 1]","I have found Maxell to be one of the reliable VHS tapes. (Sony and TDK I have always found good too.) For those who don't know, the 160 minute uses thinner tape in order to get it on the same reel as a 120. When tape is thinner there is more possibility for the layers to stick to each other by static electricity. Therefore I don't recommend 160 for repeated reusing but for some long thing, or somethings adding up to 8 hours (at SP) to save and watch sometime. The 120s I use and reuse a lot, and keep a lot too. :-) Long may the VCR's survive.P.S. oooops! Made an error above. I said 8 hrs. at SP. Of course, we all know SP is the fastest. LP or SLP - whichever your VCR has as slowest is what I meant. Fast speed recording is considered best by some. Pause at SP gives a jerky picture. At SLP you can pause and get a quite steady look at a particular shot, and the overall clarity and quality of the recording I consider quite OK.",5,Reliable standard,1360713600,"02 13, 2013",0.1234

3,A2I9XSZSHXQ3OZ,B00000J1F3,CreateEnergy,"[0, 0]",I bought this pack specifically because each tape is 8 hrs long. This length is useful for recording sports programs especially that tend to run pretty long.The quality of the picture is still pretty good even at 8 hrs. So far I have had no problems with these tapes. I suggest cleaning the tape deck once in awhile to prevent your recordings from having that annoying picture noise.I got these at a good price(just under seven bucks) on Amazon. VHS tapes are difficult to find nowadays in a regular store so I am glad I can still purchase these on Amazon.,5,Maxell T160 8 hrs,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",0.3633

I know that most of us are using DVDs now, but I still find a use at times for an eight or nine hour VC and this fills the bill. This tape stands up pretty well to being used over and over and I would surely suggested it if tape is what you need.",5,A Fine Blank VHS Tape.,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",0.3877

6,A2OPFKDHSH8T31,B00000J1F3,Jerri Moser,"[0, 0]",I gave these tapes an OK rating because they were OK for recording only one time on them but if you had to re-record on them they were no good and unfortunately I found this out the hard way.

It is very hard to find VHS in retail stores, but I am glad these tapes can be found here at Amazon and other websites as well. These can record up to 8 hours. I have a VHS tape eraser, which is a giant magnet, so when after viewing my recorded program I erase them to record another program. Very durable. Can be reused over and over again, best when you erase with the tape eraser, otherwise you will see your old program under your new program. I recommend this product. I rate this a 5 star.",5,Great product at a great price,1395792000,"03 26, 2014",0.2811
