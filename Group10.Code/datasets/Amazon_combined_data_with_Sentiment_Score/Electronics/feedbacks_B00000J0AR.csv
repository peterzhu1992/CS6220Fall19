0,A3D296RVX0JVKB,B00000J0AR,Bibliotek,"[21, 22]",this little gizmo works fine for most phones but it DOES NOT work with phones with caller ID. Keep that in mind when you're considering a purchase. Works great with the others. Overall a nifty little device.,3,Works great but...,1045612800,"02 19, 2003",0.274
1,A2G4OJFE2Q4HJO,B00000J0AR,Blaine,"[0, 0]",I bought this a few years ago and works well for the phone connection that my DVR's require. I've had no problems with this unit. This was an expansion for RCA RC926.,5,Worked so well I got another for the second DVR,1372204800,"06 26, 2013",0.194
2,A1JETHCL85UIBW,B00000J0AR,B-rad PT,"[0, 0]",These RCA wireless connectors are okay for basic phone conversation over short distances. Don't bother trying to use them for data such as with TiVo or a computer. They simply won't work. They use a fairly old technology and even basic phone conversation can result in interference from other devices in the house.,2,Don't bother for anything but standard voice connection,1259798400,"12 3, 2009",0.1212

4,A1IF3VUAXBTX00,B00000J0AR,Joaquin Arosemena Bristol,"[1, 1]","This device did not work for me. They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal. That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers. In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours, so in my case it was very noisy making the RCA adapters a total waist of money. I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me. But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones, so far I have not had any interference. You have to try them and see what works for you.",1,"Worthless, picks up a lot of noise from household appliances.",1194480000,"11 8, 2007",0.165

I have tried SEVERAL locations in the room. I have tried to contact RCA (Thomson Inc.)all you get is a recording, you can't get a live person. You can't even talk to a technical support.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!",1,VERY BAD PRODUCT,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",0.0772
6,A8Y4678B5ULS9,B00000J0AR,N. White,"[0, 0]","This product does not work with my base unit at all, even though they are both the same brand. Sales rep was very courteous and stated that it was a defective unit. However, is RCA quality control bad enough to where they get units that absolutely don't work? Very inconvenient for customers. It also seems to me that they have a huge compatability issue w/ base units and extensions from the Amazon reviews I've read. Do your homework and I would advise that anyone looking for a wireless phone jack save up a little more money and buy a better brand.",1,Be careful!,1235433600,"02 24, 2009",0.0698
