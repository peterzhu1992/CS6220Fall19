However, my Palm Vx has survived more than its share of bumps and drops with aplomb, and it's because of this case. It opens easily, closes easily, and still fits in my pocket comfortably.

It protects your Palm V from falls, spills, and related &quot;accidents&quot; I also like the look of the case a lot. It blends well with the design of the Palm V. The only &quot;cons&quot; I could find to this case is that It will add weight and size to your palm. Nonetheless, it is well worth the protection you get (Plus, this will fix the problem the Palm V has with its regular cover of turning itself on). Sure, you'll have to pull the Palm V out of the case to HotSync, but that will only take 2 secs.

5,A298COFUERZQWL,B00000J434,Carolyn Vo,"[2, 3]","This is the perfect example of excellent marketing pushing an inferior product to market. The consumer is fooled into thinking that this &quot;hard case&quot; is actually hard and is actually made of alumunim, when in fact the case is made of PLASTIC and has two VERY thin strips of aluminum outside the plastic. This case could easily crack under little pressure. I purchased this case but was greatly disappointed by the plastic composition and flimsiness of the case. For 40 bucks you think you'd get something nice and strong, but save your hard-earned money for some other case. If you want just something to protect your Palm V in, I'd strongly suggest something with a leather cover that is far more durable than this plastic case. Even better, go for the leather case that has a zipper. For even more protection, go for the Rhinoskin Palm protectors. Those are a little bit more expensive but are definitely worth the money, considering the amount of money it costs to replace your Palm if you damage it.The only reason why you should buy this flimsy, overpriced &quot;hard case&quot; is if you have a LOT of money to blow, care more about looks than functionality, and don't care if your Palm actually gets damaged. This case will pop open when you don't expect it, and who knows what will happen to your Palm's panel.",1,"NOT worth 40 bucks, is NOT strong, is made of PLASTIC",959817600,"06 1, 2000",0.1203
6,A3SMN4GQEQBCJ5,B00000J434,C. Farmer,"[1, 1]","After recently purchasing a new Palm Vx, I thought it would be a good idea to invest in a better form of protection than the included leatherette flap. The Palm V hard case is about the only sleek option that there is at the moment.The case attaches to the Palm V via the left stylus storage area. A stylus shaped piece attaches the Palm to the hinge in the case. The case itself opens like a book and allows the Palm to move much like a page in the book. Located behind the Palm on the inside of the case is an area to store a business card or other small piece of paper. The case comes together nicely and has a cut out for the IR port as well as the right stylus.Pros:1) Protects as advertised. The point of a hard case should be adequate protection first of all, and this case delivers as advertised. The aluminum reinforced plastic shell hugs the Palm V tightly and securely.2) Allows for IR port usage while resting in case.3) Case does not allow for you to accidentally turn the unit on while in your pocketCons:1) Heavy: One of the selling points for the Palm V series is the sleek, lightweight design. While this case may not seem like too much additional weight, the combination of the Palm V in the case is noticeably heavier. In fact my wife's Palm III and my Palm V weigh about the same now.2) Obstructive: hot sync is really only accomplished by taking the unit out of the case due to the girth of the case itself. A friend of mine who has a keyboard tried to rest the unit on the keyboard and found the case too cumbersome for this purpose as well.3) Hand holding the unit is more difficult. With the included leather flap, you are able to fold it behind the unit to easily hold the Palm in one hand. The hard case does not fold back on itself, which means there is a much larger surface area to support while using the Palm. This is especially annoying for me since I use my Palm frequently while standing or walking here and there.4) ...Overall, I think the hard case is best suited for someone who is looking to provide the best protection for his or her Palm in the smallest package. You will have to decide if the increased weight and obtrusiveness of the case is worth the added protection it offers. At this time, I am still using the case, but I anticipate going back to the default leather flap in the future when I grow tired of the Cons listed above.Thanks for your time...",3,Good protection comes with a trade off,1009670400,"12 30, 2001",0.2729
7,A3TRPVAGT3NWBS,B00000J434,Cliff Bauer Cliff,"[7, 7]","I was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first. Afterall, it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it. I no longer have doubts.I have unintentionally dropped my Palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces (brick, hard wood floor, etc.), and both the case and, more importantly, the Palm itself have come out completely unscathed.So, my advice is, if you are looking for real protection for your investment, just get one of these. There is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others (unless you are planning on using the Palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting range...).Not surprisingly, the engineers over at Palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish, too. You don't feel geeky pulling it out, and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the Palm itself.An excellent product.",5,"Stronger Than One Would Think &#65533; Stylish, Too!",980294400,"01 24, 2001",0.1726

It looked great and I figured if it was made by Palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toy...I mean tool...safe. Fortunately, I saw one in a store before I ordered one. As some of the other reviews have said, it's made out of cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration. The hingers are fragile and the spring-loading is weak. I don't think it's worth the cost and I've seen them as low as $25.If you're buying a hardcase, I'm assuming you want some protection for your Palm. This won't give it to you. If you just want something that looks good to cover-up, there are lots of nice leather ones out there.As for me, I decided to spend the extra money on a Rhinoskin molded aluminum case.

Palm just released a metallic blue special edition hard case that I like a little better, but this case is great.While the plastic was a bit of a turn-off, at least the brushed stainless steel makes the case a bit more attractive and looks pretty sleek much like the Palm V itself. I imagine that is part of the reason you bought the V instead of the III or the VII.The case does not close quite as tight as I would like, but if you mess with centering the hinge it closes. It provides the best protection of the cases I have tried and does not make the palm so bulky that you can't stand to take it everywhere you go.I would recommend this or the new blue case to anyone who likes the sleek modern look and wants to protect their investment and their data.",5,Just My Style,964137600,"07 21, 2000",0.5824

I tried three different 'soft' cases and always had a problem with the Palm coming on and beeping while it was in my pocket. Give this baby FIVE STARS!The critism is WRONG. A. Can't use left handed?

The only difference of the silver case and the blue special edition case other than color is the logo in the front. The blue one has the circular palm logo while the silver one has the dotted P logo of palm, like the one that you see whenever you reset the unit. I first bought the slim leather case for my Vx and after i used it for about 2 months, i became quite dissatified with it. One of the reasons why i was not happy with the slim case was because it made the whole Vx a lot bigger then it really is. Also after a few months the leather case had a few noticable scratches. It also began to warp. I decided to find an alternative. After much thought i decided to get the hard case for the Vx. At first i was discouraged that i had to remove the case every time i hotsynced. However after heeding the suggestions of many others i found that proping it up on a book or a bunch of cd cases actually works well. I dont think there is any other case that allows you to sync that easy without removing the case. In that aspect i dont think there is a better case. However i discover that you have to insert the unit properly for the case to open and stay closed right. If you dont push the case far enough into the silo it really wont work right. If you insert the unit properly it opens and closes brilliantly.The spring loaded feature of the case is probably its best feature. When opening and closing the case it is very noticable that there is more tension opening the case then there is closing. In that aspect there is really no other case out there at offers that.One thing that i disliked about the slim leather case was that often times the buttons were accidentally pressed. whether it was the application buttons or the power button, it often got pressed even with the leather case firmly closed. That was not the case for the hard case. Although the contrast button was pressed occationally pressed, its extremely rare.Also with the hard case firmly shut, the unit is allowed to move a little, just enough to allow some impact to be absorbed when you accidentally bump or drop it.Finally and more importantly the case is one of very few that actually protects the unit, looks good and maintains the shape and sleekness of the Vx. It adds virtually nothing to the overall size of the Vx. Its BEAUTIFUL...I just hope that it will fit the m505 when i go get that! :-)",5,The best overall case for the V series,990316800,"05 20, 2001",0.1106

I had a Palm III, but it died from the abuse of travelling in my back pocket. I switched to the Palm V series for its solid construction and rechargable battery. I searched for a case that would protect the device from daily wear and tear and chose the Palm V hard case for this reason. It protects the screen with its clamshell closure and does not add bulk to the package. Even with the case, it's still smaller than a Palm III. You have to keep your cradle near the edge of your desk if you want to HotSync while still inside the case. I had to add small adhesive pads to protect the metallic finish. Other than that, it's perfect! When I beat up the case too much, I'll just buy another one. My Palm V still looks brand new!",4,An excellent value,972518400,"10 26, 2000",0.084

It does a good job protecting my Palm Vx, but the case doesn't seem sturdy. There also seems to be a problem where the contrast button at the top of the Palm Pilot gets pressed by the case, this can be fixed by sliding the Palm just a hair.

14,A1AQ8LQW5QQSTD,B00000J434,Lynn B. alceria,"[5, 5]","When I saw pictures of this, I expected this to be a substantial case. Since it's called a hard case, I expected it, well, to be HARD. But it's not. It's plastic with a thin metal cover on the front and back that look more like they are there for fashion than funciton. The metal sides will give if you try to bend it. Also, I think the closing mechanism is terrible. You have to get the Palm in there just right for it to close completely and even then, it's not a tight seal. And usually when it's put in this way, the top of the case will hit the contrast button and you'll have to keep fixing it so you can view the screen. It does not snap together, which annoys me. While the case itself may not stay shut, the Palm *is* securely held in the case, which is one good thing about this case. It has a holder similair to the stylus, so you just slide it in one of your stylus slots. I prefer this way of attaching the Palm, rather than some other cases which use Velcro. I'm not going to trust velcro with something that is as expensive as a palm.I totally don't think it's worth the money, but at the same time, having good protection for your Palm is an absolute necessity, so I actually DO recommend that you get this product. My Palm has taken several tumbles and it's no worse for the wear. I've had my Palm and case for about two weeks now, and there's already quite a few scratches on the metal casing. So it does protect it. But if you are expecting this case to be really nicely made and substantial, guess again. It will however offer some protection to your PDA.I think Palm could and should be making a better product. Our Palms cost us a bundle and we want to protect them. It's almost like the people at Palm want our PDA's to break so they can sell us more. I don't see why there's so much emphasis on making the cases as small as possible. I'd rather see a slightly bulkier, yet streamlined case that not only securely held the Palm, but had about a quarter inch of foam padding on the inside to protect the unit from damage, and then a true metal casing on the outside. Even with some extra padding and bulk, the case would still be tiny.",3,Overpriced But Necessary,973987200,"11 12, 2000",0.1868

No. The case has real aluminum bonded to plastic, because one of the occasional problems I've heard about with this case is that the aluminum will sometimes delaminate and separate from the plastic.Aside from the occasional problem like that, I found this to be quality case. Although it seems little pricey when you first purchase it, it's worth it as it costs $100 to get the glass screen replaced by Palm if it breaks.",4,Offers good protection,986428800,"04 5, 2001",0.1264

Since I have the Slim Leather Case, and tried the RhinoSkin case, I'll try to address some of the complaints others have posted.It's only plastic -- True, but the outer metal shield adds quite a bit of protection.The spring is weak -- Part of the problem with using the Palm V hard case is installing your Palm. If the rail is not centered in the stylus holder, either the front or the back of the case will not close properly, giving the impression that the springs are weak. True, they could be stronger, but if you use your Palm a lot you want it to open easily. There is a line and a flat side on the rail to help you center it. It may take a few tries, but keep at it.You have to remove your Palm to use the HotSync cradle -- Not true. Just move the cradle to the edge of the table or desk and let the case hang over the edge. Just be careful you don't knock it off the desk accidently. Others have suggested placing a book under the cradle. Either works fine.Let's face it. You bought your Palm V because of it's size, and you probably use it a lot. If so, this is your best option when it comes to cases. Pretty good protection, easy to carry (very slim and trim), and easy to open and close. This case also solves the problem of your Palm turning itself on accidently, a problem with the leather cases and covers, although the leather cases are far more elegant and sumptuous. Also, because this case does not press on the scroll button, if you forget to turn off your Palm, and close the case, your Palm will will turn itself off and not run down the battery.The RhinoSkin case does offer better protection, however I did not feel it was worth the money (See my review).",4,Your Best Option,960508800,"06 9, 2000",0.1262
