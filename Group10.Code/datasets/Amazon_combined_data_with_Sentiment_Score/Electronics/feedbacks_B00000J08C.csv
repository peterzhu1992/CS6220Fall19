1,AX8SWWB9837TA,B00000J08C,Chris Peters,"[5, 6]","This stylus is metal with a high quality plastic tip, thus giving it some needed weight and smoothness when compared to Palm's pure plastic &quot;cheapo&quot; stylus. The end unscrews and reveals a pin to reset your Palm in the rare case it crashes.

3,A2OLQ18EOBZPE6,B00000J08C,Clint Herschel,"[9, 10]","These stylus' are much better than the generic plastic one that comes with the Palm IIIxe. These stylus' are much more rugged, and reliable and are built to last. You should definately replace Mr. Default Stylus. The reason being that these new Metal stylus' will improve your grafitti skills 10-fold! Another convenient feature of this stylus is that the top unscrews to reveal a reset tip. (Much better than hunting around for a paper clip to reset your device) Pick up these stylus' if you haven't already, they are really good! Certainly worth replacing the plastic one considering the price. Plus you get 3 of them in case you ever lose one.",5,Much better then the default stylus,972259200,"10 23, 2000",0.2215

7,AB2U893HHHG74,B00000J08C,John DiBello,"[45, 46]","So you've got a Palm, and you consider yourself a decent Graffiti artist, a whiz with the stylus? Not if you're still using the cheap all-plastic stylus that likely came with your Palm. These replacements (a set of three) have slightly heavier metal barrels that are easier to grip and feel more like a real pen in your hand, making tapping and writing dramatically easier and more comfortable. The hidden bonus of a reset pin inside the screw-top of each of these means you never have to carry a paperclip for the occasional soft reset (and the horror of the hard reset) again. It's a stylus you might take for granted until you are forced to go back to the plastic one, as I found when I left one at the office, gave one to my girlfriend, and lost the one I had in my case. Argh! You'll never willingly go back to the all-plastic stylus again. The price is right, so buy one, buy two, buy one for the dog (not really). Don't tap without it!",5,You don't know how much you need them until you lose them.,962928000,"07 7, 2000",0.0301
8,AEJAGHLC675A7,B00000J08C,John Williamson,"[5, 6]","The original stylus that comes with the Palm IIIxe is a simple lightweight plastic device that you'll want to replace immediately. Simply put, this stylus three-pack is a bargain, and should be the first accessory item you add to a Palm IIIxe purchase. These have a metal barrel that makes it feel like a real writing instrument and not a toy.Put one in your IIIxe, one in your briefcase or purse, and maybe one in your car, and you'll always be covered.

9,A2CLD5FSSXMYBT,B00000J08C,Joseph Sewell,"[5, 6]","The black molded plastic stylus that came with my Palm IIIxe was lightweight, functional ... and scratched my screen rather quickly, thanks to some excess flashing near the tip. These metal styli don't exhibit that problem. The extra weight also &quot;feels better&quot; in a way I can't describe otherwise. (It's not THAT much heavier, but it does feel more comfortable in your hand.) The best feature, though, is that unscrewing the top gets you to a built-in reset tool. Unfortunately, especially with third-party software, you WILL need to reset your Palm on occasion, and having a handy reset tool saves on batteries.",5,Mandatory for Palm III's,985046400,"03 20, 2001",0.3347

12,A14PHG6QJ1DTG,B00000J08C,Stephen M. Bainbridge www.professorbainbridg...,"[20, 22]","If you have a Palm, you're going to lose the stylus. If you're like me, you're going to lose one about every four months. So you're going to need replacements. If you haven't lost your original stylus yet, wait--you will. Or, better yet, toss the original stylus in favor of one of the replacement stylii. The cheap metal stylus that comes with the Palm III is hard to use because it is too light. (I have carpal tunnel syndrome and found the original equipment stylus aggravated it because of how hard I ended up gripping the stylus.) These replacement stylii are a heavier metal, which is easier to hold and considerably more accurate. Highly recommended.",5,A better stylus at a great price,968112000,"09 5, 2000",0.0746
