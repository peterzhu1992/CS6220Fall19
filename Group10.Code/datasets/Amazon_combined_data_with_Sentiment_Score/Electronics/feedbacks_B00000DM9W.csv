It would be much easier to get psyched for work if you could listen to some good NPR Morning Edition while getting clean7.

That's right... my first Sony ICF-S79V lasted almost seven years which is why I had no problem replacing it with the same model. The reason why I had to replace the radio is because the plastic lining that covers the buttons on the top of the radio started to crack and water was entering into the radio causing it to not work from time to time. The second reason is because after seven years it started to get discolored due to the humid / wet conditons.

The radio includes a wire antenna for FM reception which stows in the battery compartment.Sony recommends leaving the three &quot;C&quot; cells in the radio and changing them every year.

The digital tuning is essential - you never have to worry about finding or keeping your station. I love the presets, and listening to 60 Minutes and similar TV shows is great. The solid base means it's less likely to fall over, or off of things. The radio is pretty tough - I've dropped it and had nothing happen, but once the AM antenna broke and that was that for talk radio. And the batteries really do seem to last forever!

Wow is it great. One push on top and the radio is on. You don't even need to have your glasses on because the button is big.

As many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked, water got into the Off button area and the radio would no longer work. However I just ordered another one.This radio has some very good qualities.Pros:1) Clear and loud sound2) Battery life is so long it is ridiculous. I don't think I used more than three sets of batteries in 7 years, and I use the radio every day.3) Good reception.4) Ease of use. I really appreciate an AM/FM radio with station presets.5) It is waterproof enough that I take it in the shower every day. I don't leave it there though because I use it on the bathroom counter while I shave too. Perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it isn't in the damp shower area 24/7.6) I like the top buttons. They are easy to hit with one hand. If the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands. My radio is never mounted high so I don't have the issue others complain about where they can't see the buttons. Even if I did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bump.Cons:1) $49 is a very high price to pay for an AM/FM radio.2) It does seem Sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longer.I was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale.

I have 2 because one sits on bathroom sink and goes back & forth from bedroom to bathroom while getting dressed. The other goes between kitchen and office constantly. There's 5 presets for AM. I wish there were more. There's 10 presets for FM. One used to be for Howard until he left (a huge Howard fan here who has not gone Sirius) and now I basically only use one for WCBS-FM (when they got smart and realized, in the immortal words of NY Daily News, that they didn't know jack), and the others go unused. The TV channel part of this radio, I never use and couldn't comment.The radio is excellent. The controls are responsive, the battery life is very decent, and most importantly, the reception is excellent.The reason my radios now need to be replaced (I just ordered one from Amazon and will try the Sangean for the second) is that the top of the radio is covered in plastic.

Actually, it started wearing off after less than a year. In light of the fact that this is designed to be a shower radio, this is really an inexcusable flaw: after all, you cannot use the radio in the shower if water will seep into the innards of radio. Fortunately, I never used the radio in the shower itself. But, still, I'd have to take at least one star, even two stars off, for this defect (which I know other reviewers have commented on as well).The radio was a little smaller than I expected, but that's good. It takes up very little room on my bathroom counter and is quite unobtrusive. The reception is generally very good, although I tend to listen to only one station (89.3 KPCC). Still, I had trouble getting good reception with my last radio (an Aiwa), so the Sony is a big improvement. Occassionally, I still get a little static (depending on where I am standing in relation to the radio), but overall I would give it a score of 4.5/5.0 in terms of reception (I still occassionally get some static). I also tested all of the TV stations, and the Sony had no problem tuning them all in. No static to speak of, although the volume was low. I would definitely recommend this radio.The sound quality is quite good for a radio as small as this. I have to crank it fairly high to hear when I'm taking a shower (even though it's waterproof, I don't put in the shower with me). However, there's not distortion at high volume.I cannot say anything about the battery life yet, but overall I'm very satisfied with the radio.",4,Nice radio,1155081600,"08 9, 2006",0.1455
38,A10N9KVV3DIUWD,B00000DM9W,P. Radcliffe,"[3, 3]","Edit: Well it has been over 7 years since I purchased and reviewed this shower radio and it finally bit the dust. Radio still works (though lately I need to move it around a bit for best reception)and the clock is still really hard to see. It is the volume button that is kaput. I can only get very loud and painfully loud. Husband tried to fix it but couldn't do it. Seven years is pretty good, I guess. I don't see anything better on Amazon, at least for this price, so I will probably purchase another of the same. Something I did not mention in my original review: the batteries seem to last forever. Same number of stars for the same reasons.Original Review: This shower radio is attractive, compact and has great sound and station range. It is a 5 for the radio and a 1 for the clock. Unfortunately, the clock is very small and hard to read. I purchased it to place on a small bathroom chest close to the sink, but could not read the digital clock from there. If the radio is placed too high or too low, the small clock numbers are partially shadowed by the clock frame. There is no back light which adds to the difficulty. I had to place it on the sink vanity right next to where I stand and I still have to bend down slightly to check the time. If having great sound in a shower radio is really what matters to you, this Sony is for you. If you really need a clock in the bathroom, this is not the one for you.",3,Excellent Radio - Poor Clock,1162598400,"11 4, 2006",0.0626

I have listened to NPR in the shower almost every day since then, and it has lasted and performed well. Finally the plastic cover over some of the buttons on top started to crack and break off, so I just bought a new one. It lasts many months (6 months?) on 3 'C' batteries. The reception is pretty good. I was hoping that Sony would have made it a bit more modern in appearance, but it looks decent enough for a shower radio. I like the countdown timer, as I can turn it on for 30 minutes when I take a shower, and by the time I am done dressing it shuts off automatically.

Prior to this shower radio I had a Brookstone am/fm shower radio which took 4 C batteries and I would have to change them about once a month. I get great reception of my FM stations and I even get some TV audio through it, to listen to the Football games. It's very small and sits nicely on my pedastel and comes with a suction cup antenna.

We may have replaced the batteries once. Maybe not, I can't remember.Keep in mind that it's not designed or sold as a hi-fi radio. It's not stereo, and the speaker is not large enough to provide a wide frequency response. But for its size and shape, it's as loud and clear as it can possibly be.You will never find a better radio for use in the shower: the reception is outstanding. The speaker is clear and loud enough to hear in the shower. The case is attractive and tough. The controls are easy to operate, even with wet hands. How often do you buy a product that's reasonably affordable and absolutely flawless?Update 11/7/08: My wife still won't just leave this radio in the shower, to my occasional chagrin. She carries it around the house to listen to NPR while she works on stuff and I can never find it when I want it. Today she dropped it on our hardwood floor. The battery door popped off, and and the batteries spilled out. She put them back in and NPR was again heard from the radio.
