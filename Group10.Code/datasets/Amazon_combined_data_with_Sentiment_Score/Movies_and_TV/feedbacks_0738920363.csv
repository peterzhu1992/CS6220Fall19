0,A3QY2B5J90POMC,738920363,A Customer,"[47, 49]","At about 10 mos. my younger daughter started taking interest in this video. The muppets are interspersed with live-action clips of kids w. babies (as well s farm animals &amp; dogs) which really grabs her attention. Elmo himself is very bright and animated, which attracts the attention of kids younger than the recommended ages (3-6). I would note that my almost-5-y.o. was bored by this after one or two viewings, but is more than happy to explain to her younger sibling what is going on in the video.I noticed that the other Sesame Street videos we have do not interest my toddler like this Elmo's World video does. It seems less tedious and faster paced with more emphasis on visuals than the other Sesame Street videos do. I would recmmend this one as a nice 'first' introduction to Sesame Street beginning in the toddler years. It dosen't bother with counting and the alphabet like more 'grown up' Sesame Street, but rather focuses on this that are really facinating for really little ones like babies (like themselves!) and animals.Highly recommend - and sooner rather than later.",4,"good for toddlers, too!",975628800,"12 1, 2000",0.3841

The repiticious Elmo routine settles our savage beast. She'll still play with her toys and will walk away from time to time, but she does it quietly and always comes running back when the kazoo starts playing.

And I really can't say that with all Elmo's world shows. This video opens the way to talk to young kids about babies, dogs and farms. Which is great. I'm a home daycare provider. Over the yrs I have collected over 100 kids videos. Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs & More! seems to entertain my daycare kids ages 14 months to 5 yrs greatly. I'd say it's in the top 20 favorite videos of my daycare kids.",5,Toddlers LOVE this video,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",0.2856

7,A2RNUPVSNW1ZXX,738920363,Heather Walton,"[0, 0]",My 18-month-old loves this tape! I like that it is an hour long and keeps her occupied the entire time! There are three Elmo's World episodes: Playing with babies. Second are the dogs. The final episode examines life on the farm and daily chores done there. It is a fun tape with lots of baby animals to look at. Nothig like babies animals to capture the attention of an active toddler!

This was the first Elmo's World DVD I bought for him, because he loves dogs and farms. It turns out, though, that the baby segment is his favorite. We like to sing along with Old MacDonald. Now that we have Tivo, I could have just recorded the last 20 minutes of Sesame Street every day, but this DVD was a nice addition to our library.",5,Can't lose with Elmo!,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",0.5071

When I'm bored it's fun to laugh at how funny, In my way of age, to see such a baby show. It's like teenagers watching Winnie the Pooh. They still like it.It's like for a period of time you are little and like it and then in like first grade you hate it and think it's babyish then in about 5th grade there are no more shows on and you just look on tv and you watch it. I laugh at those things todlers would would listen to. To me it's entertaining! LAlalala Elmo's world!",5,"OkAY LOOK, I love this!",1125792000,"09 4, 2005",0.4126
12,A1GUX6R8DV3ZLY,738920363,Lauren A.,"[4, 4]","I bought this video because my daughter loves dogs and other animals. I also bought it because there is a segment on babies - as we are having a baby in a few months, I thought it would be good to expose her to little babies. My daughter this loves this video. She asks to watch it multiple times every day. Sometimes we have to hide it. She laughts at Elmo and really relates to all the animals and babies that are shown in the segments.The video is divided into 3 full length segments of Elmo's World - one on babies, one on dogs, and one on farm animals. My daughter loves each one. Plus they are very educational. If there is a new baby on the way, I DEFINITELY recommend this video as a tool to teach your toddler about babies. It discusses how to play with babies and what newborns are like.",5,"My 13 month old is in love with Elmo,,, and this movie!",1140652800,"02 23, 2006",0.3253

So, I didn't know if she would be interested in this Elmo DVD when she got it for her first birthday. But now I know that regardless of the main character, babies and doggies are a sure winner. Watching the little kids play with the babies is my favorite part, and it really gets my daughter's attention. All in all I do recommend this DVD. It shows alot, but isn't too fast paced. Also, there are some very adorbale scenes. But by the time the farm segment starts my daughter has usually lost interest.",4,very cute,1128297600,"10 3, 2005",0.3123

Rodriguez Cnyper,"[0, 0]","Elmo is so entrancing, I have no idea how he does it, but when this DVD is on, my daughter can't help but stare at the TV and talk to Elmo (even at only 6 months old!) This episode of Elmo's World is particularly cute because he explores the world of adorable babies-humans and animals. Something about babies makes other babies want to watch. Thanks to Elmo, I get some much needed Me time...Although this DVD gets old for me some days, it's worth it because my daughter is glued to it and just can't seem to get enough of this fuzzy little monster and his cute little friends!!",4,Elmo is Mommy's hero!,1258588800,"11 19, 2009",0.2247
16,A307YFSORUAXSQ,738920363,NYCPickyMom,"[68, 71]","My daughter has always loved Sesame Street with Elmo being her favorite puppet. We have the Best of Elmo, which she loves so we had to get this one since she loves looking at other babies and dogs. The segments are adorable with about 15 minutes spent on each. We get to see many different babies, even the Sesame Street cast as babies as well. The dog segment is great for us since it shows our daughter how to get along with our dog. The farm segment is my favorite. Elmo wants to tape Oscar feeding his animals, so he jumps into Oscar's trash can much to Oscar's objection. It is the first look I've ever gotten inside his can. I'll agree with one reviewer as it isn't as educational as the other Elmo's world videos, however it does teach about our world and the life in it. My daughter has been watching Elmo since she was about 8 months old (she's now a lil over 1) and her adoration has grown each day. This is a definite keeper and at the most it will keep your child entertained for about 50 minutes. This is the perfect time to get my daughter to munch on some healthy snacks while I clean up.",5,Perfect Intro to Elmo for Babies,1068768000,"11 14, 2003",0.4948

Kids love watching videos with babies and dogs in them and that's the theme of this DVD. Elmo learns about what babies eat, how they behave and the joy they bring to their families.Then Elmo learns about dogs and how to feed and take care of them. Mr. Noodle is along as he does one of his usual silly routines as he walks a pretend dog much to Elmo's and kids delight.The last part of the DVD deals with farms as Old Macdonald joins the fun teaching Elmo all about life on a farm. Elmo learns about taking care of farm animals and growing vegetables. This was a fun and educational DVD for kids from toddler all the way through early elementary school, done with the usual Elmo flair, songs and silliness.
