I thought some parts excellent, some cheesy - but good cheese. Grant himself I thought excellent as the Pimpernel. He plays the witty fop perfectly - not lazily, but one who travels, and seeks new things to be witty about. When the serious things begin, he sobers up, and you get to see the real Pimpernel. Grant rarely lets the drama of the situation weigh him down, consistently has fun with his role. Though not emphasized, his sword-play is quite passable, too.Elisabeth McGovern as Marguerite is the questionable one here. At some points, you think she is perfect for the role; at others, you wonder how they chose her to play the part. Her British accent is passable when she remembers it; and - my biggest gripe - I did not think her pretty enough for the role. She is an attractive actress, yes, but not the knockout Marguerite was supposed to be - The Most Beautiful Woman in France? I think not. Her acting is on the whole good, however, as is her stage presence, so much can and is overlooked.My biggest surprise was Martin Shaw as Chauvelin. Shaw took the role and made more of it than either Raymond Massey or Ian McKellen, combining the past lover with man striving to be in constant control of the situation. His gift for sarcasm, whether natural or invented for this role, is put to good use here. He actually seems almost human at times, trying to serve himself, and France (yes, I did get that feeling). By contrast, McKellen's Chauvelin cannot get his mind off Marguerite, and Massey's (excellent) portrayal seems one dimensional (not his fault). Martin Shaw was one of the strongest points of this production.The supporting cast was equally good. Emilia Fox (I think that's the right spelling) portrays an excellent bad girl in Episode I, While the bad guy of Episode III is superb - almost stole the show from Grant. EPisode II features another excellent bad girl who meets a surprising end. Sets and costuming are what befit a BBC production, and the camera work is excellent: frequent use of distance and panorama make it seem something other than a TV movie. Storyline and plot - it makes sense taken by itself, and provides a good, exciting romp through the world of Revolutionary France. Not close to the book, but it doesn't need to be close to the book to be effective. If you're an Orczy purist, don't bother with it. If, like me, you're looking for good period drama with a flair for action and comedy, this is excellent. And well-worth seeing, and re-seeing.

I will try to write a review that will help everyone.I am a Scarlet Pimpernel fan. I was happy to hear about the new videos and bought the set. I must say that as a fan, I was let down. As a movie fan, I found them to be tolerable. The pros and cons of the movies:Tape 1-SP Fan- The plot was of course mangled but one comes to accept that as a given in any SP adaptation. Ms. McGovern was not as vile an actress as I expected. The villains are well played. However, I found the utter change in the tone of the books to be distressing. In the books, the SP would come up with a brilliant and usually non-violent rescue. In the movie, they kick down doors, hack through anyone who gets in their way and generally make like a SWAT team. Once again, Marguerite and Chauvelin are made out to be ex-lovers, never in the book by the way. This is not giving away key plot points: Lord Tony is quickly killed! Lord Tony who survived a dozen SP books killed and forgotten about!Non-SP- Okay historic adventure. The costumes are good, the acting is solid. Robespierre is especially good. Too violent. The &quot;get a room&quot; factor is high. Worth a rent, not a buy.Tape 2-SP- Better than the first anyway. The arguments between our favorite married couple are cute. Again, not true to the tone of the books. The villainess is quite good though. How did Marguerite's hair grow back so quickly? Would they really have allowed her a wig in prison? I think not!Non-SP- Interesting relationships. The priest's plight was truly moving. I loved the part where Sir Percy pretends to be his arch-enemy! Still, there are better films in this genre.Tape 3-SP- The best of the lot and probably the only one worth buying. The writing becomes very predictable and I guessed a key suprise three minutes into the movie. Still, the vallains are good. I must agree with the review below that Sir Percy would never kill anyone like he did in this one. Too contrived an ending.Non-SP- The best of the lot. Some good suprises, some cliches but overall moderately enjoyable. Check out Errol Flynn for better examples of swashbuckling.In conclusion, Lord Tony's death distressed me greatly. The writer obviously wanted to prove that he was not afraid to kill main characters. He had already killed a league member at the beginning! Was he not satisfied? Lord Tony is the son of a Duke for heaven's sake! Do you actually believe the French could murder him in broad daylight in public in front of 200 witnesses and get away with it? It would cause a diplomatic nightmare. Anyway, since they knew he was not the SP, why did they not ransom him back? They are low on cash, remember. That's the way with these movies. They make changes and then do not support them with facts and aftermath.SP- 1 star None-SP- 3 starsEvening out to 2 stars",2,An SP fan trying to be balanced,957484800,"05 5, 2000",0.144

It had a relatively easy-to-follow plot-line as well as interesting characters (and decent acting).The other two episodes were too compacted in my opinion. They combined too much too quickly, leaving the viewer a bit confused (especially if the viewer is not familiar with the novels). Furthermore, while a film should not necessarily be the novel in action, this A&E; production takes incredibly liberties with characters and plot.Now, I purchased The Scarlet Pimpernal as part of the A&E; romance collection volume 1 from Barnes and Noble during a sale for $49.00. The romance collection volume 1 contained many other A&E; romances such as Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Jane Eyre, Victoria and Albert, and Ivanhoe. If The Scarlet Pimpernal was not part of the collection, I would never have watched A&E;'s version of The Scarlet Pimpernal.As it is, I appreciate the effort, the Indiana Jones effect of Richard Grant's acting, and the increased emphasis given to Chauvelin's character.

I had just been shaking my head over the fact that whoever filmed this apparently decided to loan Sir Percy Batman's utility belt.I've read the books and enjoyed them, but I don't insist that a Scarlet Pimpernel movie be a down-to-the-last-detail adaptation. But this show had a crudeness and vulgarity that the novels simply didn't have, and it seems to me that if you're going to appropriate a book's title the least you should be expected to do is not butcher the entire flavor of the story.This Scarlet Pimpernel isn't demmed elusive, he just goes storming in with more weaonry than his opponents and kills people right, left, and center. The elusiveness is what the story is supposed to be about: a trickster who outsmarts his opponents and is almost always so many steps ahead of him that he doesn't need to resort to brute force. There was no delight in watching it - ha! I didn't see that coming! Oh, marvelous! - as there should be.The book was wildly romantic in a purple-prose sort of way, and I simply can't see this version of Sir Percy kneeling down to kiss the ground Marguerite has walked on. And there is very little difference between the way this one acts when he's being Sir Percy and when he's being the Pimpernel; no reason anybody would dismiss the very thought that Sir Percy might be the intrepid, mocking shadow that is driving the French authorities to distraction.Even apart from those objections, the story is quite muddled. Having read the books, I knew pretty much what was going on, but if I hadn't I would have been left baffled.Complete lack of chemistry between Percy and MargueriteDo yourself a favor: Watch the Leslie Howard version, or the Anthony Andrews version.

I say &quot;might&quot;, because your opinions of this version will definitely be colored by your attachment to the other versions and their leads. I came to this video, having only seen the 1934 version a long time ago, and I watched all three versions within one week.First, the reviewers are right in identifying both the merits and faults of this version. This is a way-out adaptation of the story, so much so, that you might not recognize the story as the original one written by Baroness Orczy. Having said this, I have to add that the way-out factor consists not so much of added scenes and characters (which the 1982 version has), but of the change in the character of the Pimpernel and the emphasis on him as a man-of-action, rather than a fop or a devoted husband. There are also some major characters (in the series) bumped off either in the first episode or in subsequent episodes.If you are going to watch this, watch it as a historical romp updated for the 1990s and as a cross between the original Pimpernel and the action movies and commando movies so popular today.Also keep in mind that the romance factor (crucial in the book and in earlier versions) is reduced to practically zero, thanks to the screenplay and the palpable lack of chemistry between the leads (not to mention the miscasting of Marguerite). The most passion Sir Percy displays for his wife is when he is trying to outrun the mob to get to her. [The prison scene, starting with him descending the steps down to this frantic race is one of my favorite clips in this movie].As for Marguerite, she displays more feeling for her brother than for her husband or her former lover. Which former lover? Ah, you have to watch the movie to find that out, as well as the peculiar interpretation of her past in this version.Watch for Ronan Vibert's Robespierre and for Grant's varied smiles which convey different meanings. His best film is said to be WITHNAIL AND I, which I will certainly look out for.Yes, this version has a lot of things wrong with French history - but so does the 1982 version. This is *not* the film to watch to find out more about the revolution, even though it may be a cult favorite in AP History classes. My problems are not so much with the history as introduced in this version (the film after all is about a fictional character, to begin with), or with the departures from the story - but with the lack of romantic passion (crucial in the original story), and the many unexplained puzzles (such as a) why would Sir Percy trust an actress of dubious morals, b) why would no Parisian notice men walking around in masks, and c) who informed on a French sympathizer who was guillotined).Great photography and music, interesting take on the story, pity about the lack of chemistry between Grant and McGovern and the many implausibilities in this version.",3,"Decent on its own merits, way-out as an adaptation",992822400,"06 18, 2001",0.4587

Thus from Leslie Howard - David Niven - Anthony Andrews - Marius Goring (with no Lady Blakeney) - and indeed I've most of the classics of literature made into movies (in all their various interpretations). One must appreciate the difference between fiction - historical fiction and non-fiction in each and all of these movies.This series stands alone in what its goal is for entertainment. Much like Louie L'Amour novels - one looks for to the continuation of a particular character that they enjoy - and this is what this series does - it gives continuation to the Scarlet Pimpernel. Different actors and yet a continuation of theme and storyline.I've enjoyed this series as much as the others - especially if one remembers that this was a very dark time in history - and while one looks for the deceptions used - one must also realize over the years from the first Pimpernel - to this set - the mood and reality of movies have changed greatly.If this were the only set on the Pimpernel - the actors and actresses would be greatly accepted - the value of learning more of the revolution in the form of historical fiction would be better appreciated. And for those who like the continuation of a story it is very well presented.It is a very good series - standing by itself - and much like other movies which bring up an earlier movie of the same topic - changes have to be made with the times.c/ork,5,Have almost all of the Scarlet Pimpernel Movies,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",0.4537

Elizabeth Montgomery is a pretty woman, but she moves through this film like a cow. Richard Grant just isn't cut out to the Scarlet Pimpernel. Mr. Grant is a great character actor so he plays the disguised Percy moments well, but he is not a good leading man, so he really can't get the &quot;real&quot; Percy right. I love him when he plays sly, sniveling rodents, not &quot;the HERO.&quot;I... suggest to whomever has the power to do so that they bring back the great version of the Scarlet Pimpernel produced in the 1980's and make it into a DVD. Sir Anthony Andrews (Brideshead Revisited) played the Scarlet Pimpernel to perfection. His lady love Marguerite was played by Jane Seymour (Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman). The chemistry between these two actors was downright steamy..though they never removed their clothes. The scoundrel St.Just was played by the wonderful Sir Ian McKellan (Gods and Monsters). McKellan oozed evil and yet compelled sympathy not unlike that of Sir Lawrence Olivier playing Richard III.The story takes place in the late 1700's during the Reign of Terror when the French Revolution rolled out of control. Sir Percy, an English aristocrat (Andrews)is seen by most as a &quot;foppish gentleman&quot; who cares only for his appearance, but his close friends know the truth. Percy uses numerous disguises to cover his identity as he breaks the law and rescues French aristocrats from the guillotine.

Those who love the books and want to see an adaptation of the books.2. Those who loved the 1982 version (with Andrews and Seymour) and want to see more of that.3. Those interested in seeing the work of Grant, Shaw, Vibert or McGovern.Group 1 is generally sorely disappointed. This version changes the main character of Percy in ways that will be highly discomforting: he uses minimal disquises, he kills people willy-nilly, he uses Bond-esque gadgets instead of wit and cunning, small things like that. Not to mention, some well loved league members are killed off for no reason. To see a hilarious list of grievances from Group 1 go to: [...]Group 2 is generally disappointed too. That whole love affair/courtship thing between Percy and Marguerite is missing here. #1 of this DVD starts right off with Percy giving Marguerite the cold shoulder after their marriage. Group 2 is also upset by the change in Percy (that no disguises and murdering bit). And then Elizabeth McGovern is not as beautiful (or animated or witty) as Jane Seymour and many in Group 2 are bothered by that. Group 2 absolutely ADORES Anthony Andrews as Percy, and Grant isn't Andrews.Group 3 generally really like this DVD set -- especially if they are not burdened by preconceptions of this famous literary story. However, Group 3 is likely to be a little lost in the beginning. Note: Percy and Marguerite were madly in love with each other before getting married (you won't believe this when you see the first DVD, but it's true). On the wedding night, he receives information that she has betrayed some aristocrats. But he doesn't talk with her to find out what really happened. That's why their marriage is in need of counseling at the beginning of DVD #1.When you read the reviews (many from folks in Group 1 and 2), you'll get the impression the acting drags and the screenplay is boring. This is NOT the case (well, not in #1 and #3). Personnally I enjoy the tongue-in-cheek take on the Scarlet Pimpernel; the fact that this Pimpernel kills loads of people(!) and walks around in English clothing(!) is hilarious. Richard Grant has a lot of fun with his role; I like him more and more each time I see these DVDs.

Much criticism of this miniseries is ungenerous, and misses many of its finer points--in addition, in one case, to confusing Elizabeth McGovern with Elizabeth Montgomery.This is a very long piece of work--far exceeding Hitchcock's famous bladder test, if any zealot is contemplating a viewing in one sitting.

My only beef is their unkindness to some characters that I was rather fond of (killing them off, even when they survived in the books).Well, that's not my only beef. Another one is that, with these characters dying, it would have been nice to see some gravity in Blakeney, recognizing that his friends were dropping like flies to protect him and further his own heroic aims. Without that maturation, Blakeney seems more like an uncaring airhead than a lighthearted hero.However, they're fun discs, lots of visual appeal (especially in the first disc, during Mazzarini's birthday party, eh, Lord Dewhurst?), and a great treat for a night in with some hot tea and a purring cat in your lap.",4,"Fairly good, but not like the book",1071792000,"12 19, 2003",0.7258

I had worn my Anthony Andrews tape almost completely out, all the while hoping that someday, somewhere, someone would get the idea to bring the Pimpernel back. Well, they did. And this is the result. The casting, for the most part, is questionable. Sir Percy is supposed to be dashing and handsome, witty and absolutely hilarious. Richard E. Grant isn't any of these. He's a good actor when he's cast right. Here, he simply isn't. To be fair, he does have a few good moments, but they would have played so much better had it been someone else in the role. Elizabeth McGovern, as Marguerite, is fair. She's pretty, but a few years too old. She has, at least, some of the charm that the role requires. Perhaps the best casting comes in the form of the two villains. Martin Shaw as Chauvelin and Ronan Vibert as Robespierre are excellent. They convey total believeability in their roles.

There's adventure and intrigue in places, but sometimes (as in Book Two, &quot;Mademoiselle Guillotine&quot;) the story drags.The attention paid to reconstructing the period must be commended. In this version, far more than any other version (yes, even the 1982 one, alas) the viewer gets a real sense of what it was like to live back then. There's the decadence of the English aristocracy and then there's the dirty, dangerous life in revolutionary France. Overall, this mini-series should have been much, much better.",2,"Sir Percy, I hardly know you",1078012800,"02 29, 2004",0.2133

This movie brings out all of the fine points of Baroness Orczy's fabulous tale. Richard E. Grant is hilarious and dashing. The attention to historical details are, for the most part, accurate. Those interested in the French Revolution will be tickled to hear &quot;ca ira&quot; played throughout the first episode. They will also enjoy the actor who plays the diabolical Robespierre, his dead eyes and foppish attire seem to capture the essence of the Incorruptible.If you are looking for a swashbuckling tale, this set is for you.

Guillotine the most.Yes, I did LOVE Ronan's character as well, as evil as he was, and in the Kidnapped King he was the VERY best - he even cracks and it's great to see his uptight Robespierre begin to get a little rough around the edges and show his real nature.I absolutely fell for Richard E. Grant as the damned elusive Pimpernel, and kind of liked the evil cold-hearted Robespierre.This, to me, was a very fun set, and wish I could have seen the actual television show with the guys...Oooo - it's SO not a waste of your time or money.

It has all the ingredients adventure, a hero in disguise, an evil villain, a great heroine and action and adventure.I really like this version. I thought that no one could surpass Anthony Andrews , but , as usual I was wrong. Richard E. Grant is utterly perfect. He can be a stupid snob while he is Sir Percy and a great, sensible hero when he is the Pimpernel. His performance is elegant, wit and funny.Elizabeth Mac Govern plays a real Marguerite. Not a stupid, simple woman as others have done before. She was a great actress before her marriage. She has a past and that is why I like her. A real heroine who matches the heroe, not one who is crying all the time and waiting for him to save her.Martin Shaw is the best Chauvelin. He is a villain, with that dark secret that makes him more human. But also his wicked sense of humor keeps the high level in the film.And plus, add a great score. A wonderful music with a catchy melody and you have a great serie. BBC always keeping its standars. Let's hope they will going up.",5,"Honey, I'll be late tonight",1080432000,"03 28, 2004",0.3528

You will be disapointed.If you found this off of the 1982 version of the movie, go ahead and watch it but you might be disapointed too.If you don't know anything about The Scarlet Pimpernel, you'll probably think it's fine as a one-time thing.What this version of the Scarlet Pimpernel tries to do is make Sir Percy more of a Bond character than he was originally intended to be. Richard E. Grant was an inspired choice. He has the posh dork routine down pat. Elizabeth McGovern was not so great a choice as she seems lifeless and Martin Shaw would have been fine if they hadn't tried to make him sexy.The biggest problem here is not the actors, nor is it the hideous clothes and makeup (I could overlook the atrocity of those wigs and gowns given the proper incentive). Even the violence, which others have decried, I could have gone with. That is what gets audiences these days, after all. No, the big issue is that the scripts lack wit and any element of surprise. You always know what's going to happen, there are no strong relationships between the character, and there is a total lack of suspense.[...]",3,It all Depends on how you Look at It,1316304000,"09 18, 2011",-0.1009

Grant drives every scene he is in with his somewhat manic, adrenalin-junkie rendition of the Pimpernel. It was quite fun to see him played as a less than perfect-- but very lucky-- risk taker. One caveat-- although some of the broad outlines are there, this one wanders far from its source.I did say that the second one was weak. It was like they got to near the end of the movie, realized they didn't have time to resolve the interesting situation they had set up, so they threw up their hands, killed some characters and everyone else escaped on horseback. Disappointing in the same movie where Richard E. Grant (disquised as a French agent) grows more and more hilariously indignant as a Revolutionary official admits to ignorance of the Scarlet Pimpernel.I certainly hope there are more as long as they can keep up these high standards.",5,"One and Three were great fun, Two had its moments.",947721600,"01 13, 2000",0.2771

Mr. Grant added a dimension that was unique: he was all the Pimpernel should be and incredibly charismatic. All the acting was excellent, but his stood out in particular since he embodied the hero so well and was so charming. I will miss not being able to watch more of this excellent actor. Someone in an earlier review criticized him as not being their idea of a leading man. To me, he was one of the best leading men I have seen in ages. Granted, he does not have the perfect looks of a Tom Cruise, but he has an inner depth that gives him an appeal that far surpasses any Mr. Cruise or another pretty boy may possess.
