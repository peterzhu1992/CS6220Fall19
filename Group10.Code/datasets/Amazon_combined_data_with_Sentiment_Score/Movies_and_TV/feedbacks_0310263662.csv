When it started everybody just shut up. It got interesting from the begining when Jesus starts praying in the garden and Judas betrays him. In the parts where I almost cover my eyes where on the part of the whips and chains and those things. The part where he carries the cross was one of the saddest things for me.Now we'll talk about the performances. The best performance in the movie was Caviezel's. He was the best Christ I've ever seen in movies. He looked so much like the Jesus. I think the best actor who played Christ. Then there is Mary, Jesus's mother. Did you know that the actress who played the Virgin Mary is Juish ? Her expressions were very well done. Her sadness was incomparable. She is one of the best actress I've seen to this day. Then there is Satan. I do not know who the hell (haha) plays Satan, but she/he (I think it's a SHE) plays the part very...coldly, very...frightening. Good performance too.The movie itself was TOOOOOO violent. It's the same story, but the last twelve hours of Christ, but expressed in a very explict graphic and violent scenes. I bet you know more than two people died of watching Jesus being beat up with whips and chains and weapons. I didn't enjoy that at all. The performances were uncomparable. This movie is the most famouis R-rated movie of all times, I think you do not know that, but there are always some exceptions. It is one of the movies that you feel like you don't wanna see twice.There was also tons of strange stuff that happened during the making of the movie, I think most of you know, but for those who do not know I'll mention some of them below.When James Caviezel was crucified, I lightning stroke on his right shoulder. They had to stop the filming until he had to get better. Then, on the scenes in which he carries the cross he dislocates his shoulder (I don't remember which one it was) and they had to stop the filming for another three to six weeks. Then there was the part in the movie where Jim is taken to see some guy who looked weird that had make-up and a wig (I do not remember who that was) and when that guy spoke his lines from the script, he said other strange stuff he didn't wanna say and he had no control of it. Freaky, I know. At the part of the whipping, Jim Caviezel obviously pretended to be taken the hits, except three or four, some of those times when Caviezel was being hit with whips, they really hit him in the back a couple of times. In an interview, Caviezel explained that and he said he felt what Jesus himself felt when he was being punished. There were much more strange things that happened but I think if you buy this WIDESCREEN or FULLSCRENE edition DVD, I think if you access the SPECIAL FEATURES menu, then there should be some intervies in which Caviezel explains everythink.Buy this DVD or the FULLSCREEN formate. There are no different except on the screen, obviously. I am not that kind of a person in which likes to watch Jesus getting punished. It's sad.",5,Mel and Jim are just fantastic !!!,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",-0.0246

Most of the work seeks the genuine passion; some of it is interpretational; but all of it is intensely passionate. Mel Gibson didn't simply recreate the scenes well and give history its native tongue, he also presented intensity and humanness in a very real way. If we are to believe that there was a God-man who died a cruel death on all of our behalf, then that Emmanuel was made human and divine by Jim Caveziel, better than any other actor. We can make all we can out of our past and the good old days when America seemed more like Christendom, but theatre goers of old would not accept this suffering Jesus, so at least in our post-Christendom time, we at least accept The Passion well enough from several sectors to be able to embrace the whole package. As a spiritual event, The Passion of Christ is unvarnished, broadening our horizons of appreciation and compunction. As history or entertainment, it may be merely a fascinating reinactment of a horrific death penalty for a major philosophical and charismatic leader.Specifically, the focus and intensity of Judas's betrayal, Christ's Passion in the Garden, and his arrest are done with dramatic, slow-motion timing. The extent of Jesus's suffering has been commented on truly enough, but the ordeal is certainly brought in long and vivid detail. There is certainly a perfectionism in Gibson's rendering of each torturous moment. If we doubt the divineness presented, then how about the love and forgiveness presented under torturous circumstances Look, mother, I make all things new! Then, if there's incredulousness about the human traits, see similarly, the flashbacks of memory to a playful time with his mother or Caveziel shaking and looking with dread as they save their worst whips for last during the scourging. The presentation of the devil and Judas's anguish after his betrayal are fine interpretive moments. If you think the text is too harsh on the Pharisees, then just read the Bible. If you think that Pontius Pilate isn't the political weasel presented or the Roman soldiers were too rough, then think again.The Passion of Christ is a courageous and authentic reinactment of the Passion and Death of Christ. For the two-plus hours we go through this confrontation, we are relieved by some beautiful and necessary flashbacks that are well highlighted. It is an awesome film.",5,"It Is as It Was!

Though very violent, this is what really happened (if not exactly like the actual event, at least close to it), and therefore something we must be aware of, rather than having the facts sugar-coated.Additionally, Gibson put in greater depths to Christ's suffering by having flashbacks to Palm Sunday as well as his childhood, and this just made me weep all the more. If you haven't seen the movie, you must watch it to see how these events fit into the context of the last 12 hours.A haunting and powerful film, it made me weep up to the very end.

11,A3OGWBZV2F8M74,310263662,Adam Rosenbaum Author of 'How to Remember No...,"[8, 11]","The Passion of the Christ is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. After reading up on the events of Jesus' last twelve hours as well as commentary from respected sources like Pope John Paul, I watched this film with an eye on the historical details as Mel Gibson presented them.It is true that the scenes involving the whippings and the crucifixion are extremely brutal and disturbing. But one of Gibson's purposes in making this movie was to demonstrate how Jesus suffered at the hands of the Roman guards. The newspaper critics who smugly wrote this off as if it were one more sadistic Hollywood bloodbath miss the point that anyone can produce a blood-gore-and-guts film, but very few can make it relevant in a historical perspective.Another interesting feature of The Passion is the fact that the majority of the dialogue is in Aramaic, and in the case of the Romans, Latin. I was surprised to recognize at the beginning of the film the words of one of the 4 questions that we ask at the Jewish Passover meal called Seder: Why is this night different than all other nights?If there is any criticism it is that from time-to-time Gibson transitions from one scene to the next almost too quickly, and it's not always easy to keep track of who's who or what they're doing. This aside, the scenery and acting are top-notch and the story is engaging even though you know the ending.One additional item I was curious about was the charge of anti-Semitism, especially regarding the representation of the role of the Hebrew priests in Pilate's decision to crucify Jesus. Personally I think this charge was a lot of nonsense coming from people who tend to run their mouths too much. The facts are that Jesus was challenging the corrupt temple hierarchy, and the Hebrew priests' motivations were largely political, e.g., getting rid of a potential threat. During the movie I really didn't see how anyone could interpret this differently, unless you were looking for a reason to do so.The Passion of the Christ is well worth watching and I strongly recommend it. But be prepared, because there's no doubt about the fact that some of the scenes are very rough.",5,One of the most intense movies I have ever seen,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",0.1519
12,A3IAP2JMTP5YBN,310263662,adriana alisa,"[2, 10]","Well, after hearing all the CRAZED controversy about this film,I felt a lot of anticipation about the movie. I expected a punch in the gut- a moving,wrenching film; in short, I expected to be blown away.Well, after seeing the movie, I was neither incredibly moved, nor blown away. I just experienced an assault of never-ending violence that wasn't all that graphic, and was just pretty pointless.I understand Gibson wanted to show the world what Jesus went through, what he sacrifcied. But having Jesus whipped with a spiked barbell for 127 minutes is not the way to go about it. I WANTED to be moved, I WANTED to feel Jesus's pain and be changed or whatever by seeing all that he experienced. But I wasn't; I felt like I was being attacked by Mel Gibson who probably thought that the best way to go about it was to show Christ getting beaten, stabbed,whipped for over two hours. Instead of feeling moved-I felt numb.A few things I did appreciate was the acting-which felt very natural and didn't go over the top. What I liked the most about Passion was the fact that Gibson chose to film the whole thing in Latin with subtitles.This definately was a huge plus to the film-and it made it feel a whole lot more authentic.I can't say how much I appreciated the people behind the film going that extra mile, because it definately paid off.Is the Passion of the Christ worth seeing? I'd say, no, not really. I can't say that its a complete waste, but it really builds no common ground with the viewer-and, really, the violence is nothing to talk about. True, there is A LOT of it, but it isn't particularly graphic -I just think that its impossible to build a film, no matter what the subject involving nothing but violence,violence, and violence.So,even if you're simply going in for curiosity, there's nothing here that's going to shock or surprise you.It's a well put together film-but for such an important theme it really provides nothing to think about.p.s.-I'm Jewish, and while I can see what people mean when they say that there was a slight anti-sematic element to the film, it was a lot more slight than I expected, and I personally was not offended.I'm not a history expert-I really don't know a thing about the Bible or history, so I'm not one to discuss the film's accuracy. On a second note, I think it's kind of pointless that a person would go in to see a movie expecting a history lesson. This is one guy's personal vision-not a documentary, or a historical novel, and I'd never go into a film expecring anything of the kind. And after seeing the film, I had to laugh a bit about all the hoopla and controversy surrounding it. There's really nothing controversial about this movie(save the fact that it's about Jesus), and if the man behind the whole thing wasn't blockbuster king Mel Gibson, I doubt that anyone would've said a word about it.Overhyped, overblown- and not really a point to it.It's well put together, well acted, and for that, I give it some credit.But, that is simply not enough.",2,2.5 stars,1086998400,"06 12, 2004",0.0551

I don't have any problem with someone wanting to tell some version of the Gospel stories with a measure of cultural accuracy: that is an interesting idea, and perhaps timely. I have no problem with the writer adding mythological elements of his own: that is to be expected, and anyway it is in accord with biblical mythology. I see no merit in the claims of anti-Semitism: only the leader of the Sanhedrin is really blamed for Jesus' condemnation, and it is clear that others disagree. There is no uniform antipathy directed towards the Jews in this film.And yet I find this film one of the most despicable exercises in sadism that I have ever witnessed. There is not a shred of genuine religious feeling here, just a terrible desire to turn the gospels into a fantasy of cruelty beyond anything that is actually written. Yes, the Romans were capable of great barbarism, but what we see here is beyond all belief. (Strange that no Italians have risen up in protest: they have far more cause to complain than those who are Jewish.) This film is not a testament to a Christian faith, it is a testament to a sickness of soul that, by the tone of many of these laudatory reviews, is now horribly shared.

19,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,310263662,"A. Gyurisin good friend, damn fool","[4, 7]","To start us out on the right foot, I thought that it was good, but definitely not great. Mel Gibson is a powerful director that proves that he can handle big epics like Braveheart or very emotional stories like Passion of the Christ. His creative eye and ability to transform a simple story into a very real and seismic journey is impressive. There are not many directors that I feel could handle these two challenges together. Gibson has proved that he could twice. Throughout this film, I was constantly impressed with the visual images that were presented before me. Everytime Jesus was hurt, I could feel the pain just oozing from the television. The ability that Gibson has to bring us these hauntingly beautiful images and also control his actors into becoming their characters left my jaw on the ground. He is a genuine director that was able to bring his personal passion to the screen with bold emotions and a powerful eye.As mentioned before, I felt that Gibson did a fantastic job and should have been recognized by the Academy for his ability in Passion, but the overall film seemed lacking. There I was, sitting on my couch deeply getting involved with the film, when suddenly it is over. The last twenty minutes of this film just seemed like they were rush edited together. I realize that it is only supposed to be an account of the final twelve hours of Christ, but I needed something sturdier to wrap the film up. There just seemed to be so many loose ends. Perhaps it had something to do with the random and chaotic flashback sequences that both aided and hurt the overall tone of the story. The flashbacks were helpful in identifying the when and who of the story, but never really hit upon the why. Some flashbacks helped progress the story, while others just left me with a puzzled look on my face. This was a negative aspect of the film. I think the writers of this film should have just allowed the story to progress from the beginning. Not necessarily taking up hours in building these moments, but a quick recap at the beginning would have helped the less religious person in me. I just felt the ending and these brief snippets were distracting and not as informational as I wanted them to be (which is why they were there in the first place).Aside from that, the rest of this film was a sheer enjoyment to watch. To see this man suffer for our sins was impressive and an act that you would not see today. The actors in this film exceptionally portrayed the characters. James Caviezel's emotion is unmatched in the film industry, while the nearly wordless actions of Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci added so much more to the story. To see their eyes along could bring tears to any strong person. The portrayal of Satan (or evil) was also impressive. I didn't quite know how Gibson was going to incorporate this, but the method that he used provided this real image of evil instead of a cartoonish or CGI monster creation. It kept the story balanced and provided some controversial themes for Christ as he carried the cross. The reality of this film is what also impressed me. Sometimes with adaptations you get these random tangents that feel like the director was just looking to pull more people into the theaters, but not with Passion. Gibson's choice to use the language at the time was absurdly perfect. I would have preferred to see this film without the subtitles, because it would have built a stronger emotion behind the events as they took place. Since he did not do that, the choice to have it subtitled with still the original voice again kept this film grounded.True, this was a story about Jesus, but to me what was harder to watch was the violence that man has inside of him. Here we have a truthful story showing man destroying man. That to me is more frightening than all the blood on Jesus. To watch another person do what they did to this person was simply horrific. While others will argue that this never happened, I say to them, pick up a newspaper and read the headlines. The actions that we do to our fellow man are just as bad as what these Romans did to Jesus. While we may not see all the blood, our consistent lack of respect and rising murder rate prove that we care nothing for our neighbor. This had me thinking that perhaps Gibson's true message had something to do with the status of our world today ... hum ... something to think about!Overall, I thought this was a good movie, just not the greatest I have seen. Perhaps the excitement and publicity (good and bad) surrounding this film built it up too much, but I have seen better. Sadly, I think the religious people in the world that speak negatively about this film need to realize that it was just a film. There are worse movies being released today that perhaps they should be focusing their attention onto. Gibson should have been nominated for an award for this film just because of the power that he created. I also think that Caviezel and Morgenstern should have been rewarded for their work. I have seen emotional films, but these two actors brought more to the table than I have seen in any other film. It impressed me, and it should have impressed the Academy. While I think everyone should see this film once, I do not believe it is one that should be continually recognized as one of the greats. Gibson could have had the best film of the year, but loose ends and fragmented flashbacks caused this film to stay at average.Grade: combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt out of *****",3,Why is this night different from every other night?,1112745600,"04 6, 2005",0.0336

It interweaves high-level violence worse then you found in most horror films, the subtitling of two languages, and the brutal simplistic story of a medieval passion play. There is a single theme brought home again and again. Christ suffered for our sins.When Mel Gibson first planned making the film, he didn't want to use subtitles. Through most of the film, you don't need them anyway to understand what is taking place. There is a visual language in the stylised costumes, and the acting.Jesus Christ (James Caviezel) has a quiet distance from the world that shows without words he is the Son of God. Speaking, Caviezel detracts from this by delivering his lines with a wooden earnestness.The film occurs during the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus. It isn't easy to understand the story. Gibson may think his audience will have read the New Testament. Or he didn't want this story to detract from the violence, at the heart of the film.This violence begins when he is taken prisoner by the Jewish Temple Guards. To describe the violence he suffered here would be to detract from the graphic nature of it. Reading what happens to him, you won't be able to suspend your disbelief to believe he could have survived any of it.The scourging of Jesus is made worse by Gibson's attention to detail. The Romans have to work themselves up to be able to do it. The sound made by the torture instruments striking into Jesus' flesh. Even when Gibson shies away from the scourging, you can still hear it. This will probably become one of the most memorable, and horrifying, sequences in cinematic history.Between the scenes of Jesus' torment, we witness the other characters in the story. Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello) receives his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. But he, and his money are cursed. In scenes of graphic ugliness, he is driven to madness and suicide.The two Marys, Jesus' mother (Maia Morgenstern) and the former prostitute Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) are there to witness, and react to the suffering of Jesus. It is from them, we are meant to gauge how to feel about the events unfolding on the screen.These events are of suffering and pain. The actual crucifixion is almost a relief after the scourging. By then Jesus is a half dead, blood-splattered ruin of a man. He dies on the cross along side two common criminals. To keep the interest of his audience, here Gibson adds Hollywood touches you won't find in any bible.You also won't find any spirituality, or goodness here. The theme of this dark movie is the pain and suffering Jesus suffered on behalf of Christians. For them, it is a gorefest held in a good cause.

It is still a very good film, and a powerful one, but I also realize after thinking, that it really isn't that hard to make audiences feel emotional about the crucifixion of Jesus. I understand why it was such a phenomenom, but I don't wish to hail it as I once did, due to the fact that the film just isn't as amazing in my mind months later, unlike other films I have seen this year and loved.

I could write at least 1,000 words about this film, but will simply urge everyone (except children) to see it.It is very violent, but so is the earth we walk on, with its earthquakes and volcanos, and continual wars since the dawn of man. I think perhaps some people find this film more graphic than the usual senseless savagery that assaults the senses in today's films because of the meaning behind the scourging and crucifixion; it is very disturbing, and it should be. There is no anti-semitism, any more than there would be anti-romanism. No one killed Jesus, He laid down his life. It also depicts extremely heroic and compassionate Jews, and priests who are angered by the arrest of Jesus and call it a travesty.The cast is superb, as well as other elements like cinematography, score, and art direction, but this is Gibson's masterpiece, a magnificent work that will touch millions of hearts that are ready to hear its message.The DVD release (which includes no extras) is a rather dark transfer, at times not having the full range of color of the original.

The film has been the generator of an impressive publicity campaign: magazines, TV, newspapers, religious and non-religious comments, you name it. However, the most interesting thing about it is that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is not your typical Hollywood biography, this is not a crowd-pleaser, the film is a risky proposal and doesn't make concessions at all.Director Mel Gibson could have made a comfortable film, with well-known superstars such as himself in the lead roles, but the main criterion to chose the actors was that their physical appearance and acting style were suitable for the essence of each role. Basically, the cast is a bunch of little-known actors (at least when the movie was filmed): Jim Caviezel as Jesus, the gorgeous Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Rosalinda Celentano as Satan and Maia Morgenstern as Mary. Most of those names didn't say too much before the release of the movie, but their performances are solid and believable.In the technical aspect &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is EXCELLENT. The costumes, the makeup, the photography, the sets, the locations are amazing, you really get the sensation that you are a witness of the real events. The photography shows beautiful landscapes that made a big contrast with the tragic scenes in the movie, a very interesting combination. The music is atmospheric and the sound effects are very real.&quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; visually is one of the most powerful movies ever made because there are a lot of violent scenes, most of them are so real that you can almost feel the pain and the torture, definitely this is not a movie for little children, is a movie for mature audiences. By the way, there has been a lot of criticism for Mel Gibson because some people think that &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is an anti-Semitic movie, that is, against the Jewish, but let's be objective here, the message is very clear and obvious, &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is a criticism against THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE, not against a specific community.&quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites everybody to reflect about our violent behavior, most of us are capable of using violent methods in order to get our own benefit. &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; invites us to reflect about our very own human nature. Definitely, Mel Gibson is a very, very interesting director, let's keep an eye on him, he might surprise us again, like he did with &quot;Braveheart&quot; and with &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot;.",4,A MOVIE THAT'LL GIVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME,1091750400,"08 6, 2004",0.5507
27,A34R3PM9KEWNZS,310263662,__Alessandro__,"[19, 24]","I suspect that most Christians already owned a copy of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. In my case, I owned the widescreen edition.If you don't own a copy -- Stop reading right now, and buy this DVD!If you do own a copy, you're probably wondering what's new in this re-release.Mel Gibson's 2004 blockbuster is at the same time part documentary and part (very personal) artistic meditation of the Passion -- the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is perhaps one of the most moving films ever made and one of the most important films for evangelism in today's secularist Culture of Death.Three years after its release (which, like the Gospels themselves, was a source of heated debate and division), it has been re-released as a Definitive Edition, with a number of special features:The movie is still in Aramaic and Latin, with subtitles. The purpose of this is to avoid bringing Jesus into today's world and rather force the viewer back in time, as if you were a witness to the actual events. Disc 1 has both the theatrical and re-cut version of the film, complete with accompanying commentaries by filmmakers, cinematographers, producers, musical directors and theologians. A particularly wonderful feature is an enhanced viewing mode featuring Biblical footnotes while the movie is playing. Disc 2 features one reasonably in-depth behind-the-scenes/making-of documentary. The other features on this disc include mini featurettes on religious art, ancient languages, a short showcase of the actual places in Jerusalem where the Stations of the Cross occurred, production art, a couple of deleted scenes, and a few other things like actors' bios and (disappointingly short) lives of the saints.Personally, I found the discussion regarding ancient languages most interesting. Fr.Fulco, who served as historical and ancient language consultant during the scripting, shooting and post-production of the film, is erudite and well spoken. The section on religious art was quite engaging, but a bit disappointing in its superficiality (perhaps because I have a particular interest in art history and love the details). It would have been nice, for example, if the names of artists and some details of the pieces accompanied the art documentary and the art gallery. However, in exchange, the DVD gives a great mini documentary on crucifixion as a mode of punishment and execution.As far as the behind-the-scenes features, most touching were Jim Caviezel's humble and soft-spoken interview, during which he (and others) describes the physical, mental and spiritual anguish he was made to endure during the making of this movie -- which include, but are not limited to, eight-hour makeup sessions, itching, migraine headaches, freezing weather (while in a loin cloth), being whipped for real, having the several-hundred-pound cross fall on him and crush his skull, and being struck by lightning.Over these past three years, I have often wondered (with great frustration) why they didn't include extras on the DVD release of The Passion of the Christ. Perhaps the reason was that they did not want people to view this as a regular movie, concentrating on how it was made, etc. Rather, they wanted people to take the movie as it was and concentrate on the message and the emotional/spiritual impact that it had on them, as viewers. Whether Catholic/Christian, Jewish, agnostic or atheist, it is sure to have profound impact on the very fiber of every human being.This re-release comes at a good time -- just when the movie is starting to fade from people's minds. The strong impact that it had three years ago is starting to taper out, and people are settling back into their fast-paced modern lives, which too often results in a distilling of religious convictions and a laxity of spiritual fervor.Well, Lent is around the corner (February 21, 2007), and this movie makes a wonderful accompaniment to spiritual preparation during this time.For those who have never seen the movie, now is the time.For those who have seen it, but don't particularly care to see it again -- The extras may give you a new appreciation for the film and spark a sudden desire to watch it over again.

As seen in the film, among the motives the Sanhedrin had to kill Jesus was fulfill a commandment to execute a blasphemer.No film until The Passion of the Christ had shown how Jesus was marred more than any man. The deliberate depiction of the process of His execution shows that God loves us enough to send His own Son to die a cruel death that we might be saved.

34,A3NQU1649SH0Q4,310263662,"Allen Smalling Eclectic Reader,","[7, 11]",".To me Mel Gibson's stunning THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST may not be world class but is close to it, as memorable in its way as TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS or AMARCORD and worthy of such enduring acceptance.Was Gibson's life-work anti-Semitic? In my opinion, no. Blame Herod, who is at all times righteous, unbending, fixated on Jesus' technical violations of Hebraic codes and totally hypocritical when viewed against his son's sybaritic, Romanized and decadent lifestyle -- truly a Pharisee! But the film's plotwork: the New Testament book of Mark, Chapters 14 through end, with flashbacks to Chapter 13, give us sufficient motivation to the Herod character by mentioning his envy of Jesus--surely that envy could only be spiritual and not material or political, except political-by-indirection? The other two Synoptic Gospels, Matthew and Luke, enhance the motif.Also, Gibson's film portrays not so much the mob, the crowd, the Jews, or what other popular English-language bible translations have calling for Jesus' crucifixion after Barabbas' release; rather, the film clearly shows Pilate offering the option that Jesus be spared or executed after physical chastisement and Herod himself specifically calling for His crucifixion and then, the heavy majority (but NOT all) of those gathered chiming in.Perhaps the film can be gently blamed for over-sympathizing with the Romans, but the pendulum swung both ways. The centurions and soldiers charged with whipping Jesus were clearly a sadistic lot who specialized in torture and crucifixion, ogre-like in appearance, with heavy broad noses and dark brown eyes. (They both looked and acted subhuman.) On the other hand, and I think Gibson is using Italian racial sub-typing to his advantage, the common soldiers whose task it was to accompany Christ to Golgotha, while keeping away the locals who wanted a piece of Him, had more clearly Piedmontese features, aquiline noses and hazel eyes.An excellent Eastern Bloc actor played Pontius Pilate and invested the character with a great deal of sympathy by means of close acting that showed the dilemma Pilate was in: the necessity of practical politics overriding the desirability of treating Jesus in a more humane, common-sense manner (at least according to Roman AD 30 standards). In one of the few additions to material not found in Matthew, Mark or Luke; Lydia, Pilate's wife, brings several clean white-linen pieces of cloth to Mary and Mary Magdalene. We, the largely Christian audience, know that these will become relics.Was THE PASSION OF CHRIST violent? In a B-movie sense, meaning gratuitous brawling and blood-letting, no. It was true to the text in that it portrayed the last 12 hours of Jesus' life in a graphic, literarily ash-can Naturalistic fashion, right down to the maggots crawling out of the head of a dead donkey within Judas' vision as he slumps against a tree in terror. (Judas never has a moment's peace after he tries to return the thirty coins to Herod.) So while THE PASSION was not violent, it was gruesome; but it was gruesome within the bounds of what the Bible tells us took place. Perhaps nationally-syndicated film critic Roger Ebert said it best when he said that only Mel Gibson's standing within the movie industry let this film be branded an R instead of an NC-17.Should Mainline or Liberal Protestants like Methodists, Lutherans or Presbyterians see this film? YES! Why not, if they've a mind to? Avoiding this film out of mere squeamishness would merely validate the stereotype that Establishment believers are a bunch of comfortable wishy-washies who are all for confronting the realities of life, death and poverty--as long as we subsidize it and someone else does the job of facing the actual ickies.I learned a lot from this film. Personally, it was cathartic as well as riveting. Interestingly, as with most people at the cinema, what provoked the tears was not so much the cruelty but the response along the lines of Do you REALIZE what you're DOING and to WHOM?. Because everybody killed Jesus. And everybody is capable of killing God and killing us, too. Roman Catholic doctrine such as the veneration of Mary and Imitatio Dei were opened up to me in ways I'd never understood before.Personally, I urge anyone with the slightest interest to see THE PASSION OF CHRIST, and not to write it off as some spiritual howler meant only as a sock to the jaw for the most hard-headed kind of R.C.'s or Evangelical Protestants in buses.

As a seminary student, I wish to say a few things about this movie. Whether or not you agree with me, that is your deal, say what you wish yourself about it. First off, I want to say I do not like this film. This is not a fun film. This is not a film you would go to the Blockbuster to rent on a Friday night, to watch while eating popcorn. This is a film about Good Friday. This is a film about the Cross and Jesus' sacrifice. Thus leads to the second point. Secondly, this is a brutal film because...and if we are realistic about the Biblical narrative and the history behind the practice of torture and crucifiction by the Romans...we are talking about a truly violent event. More than violent though, debasingly brutal in every extreme. There was blood. There was torn flesh. There were cries of pain, even from Jesus' lips. Ergo, we should not turn a blinds eye and forget the true power of what occurred that Friday two thousand years ago. We should come to this movie in solomn understanding that what we are watching is not going to be enjoyable, but it is necessary for us to see so that we don't pretty the Gospel and skip over the drops of blood from Christ Jesus' body during those hours. This was a sacrifice in all sense of the words, Jesus was...and is...our Scapegoat, replacing us and bearing the sins for us so that we may (through Him and only Him) come to the Father, Yahweh. I watch this film because I have to, I need to, I need to be reminded and I need to be counseled in the ways of our Lord and Savior, the one true God, Yahweh, who shows Himself to the world as Jesus Christ. I must be reminded and be mindful of what Jesus did that Friday along with the Sunday afterwards. I need to be thoughtful toward the everlasting Gospel of God. Even though I may disagree with some of the symbolism used (mostly Catholic), I still can take a lot from the film and learn.With that said, I wish to speak to those who have been belittling and accusing this film. First and foremost, yes it is a Catholic film and there are a lot of Catholic imagery in it. The way the movie portrays Mary is very Catholic in terms of how she acts and how she is presented. Is this a bad thing? Well, as a Protestant seminarian, I have to say, no not for me at any rate. I understand what is being shown, and while I may disagree with it, I have myself no problem in holding out a hand in friendship to Catholics (i.e., I don't believe in Catholic badging like some people seem to be doing just because Mr. Gibson is a Catholic and uses Catholicism in the story narrative). Still, you may feel that Mary the mother is given more power than she is truly given in the Bible, for as we read the Bible, and we know the Bible's truth, we see that Mary was just one woman who had given her life to Jesus by accepting the mantel of being the mother. She is not glorified as the Catholics say she is, in the Bible if you have read your Bible, but she is shown to be a woman (just as mortal as you and I) of faith. Secondly, I wish to say...as a supporter for such organizations as Jews for Jesus...this film in my opinion is not Anti-Semitic. There is no Anti-Semitism in this film. This film does not go out of its way to show the Jews as the bad guys because, if you were watching the same film I was watching, the film showed that there were Jews of all kinds at this dark day-Jews like John the Apostle, Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the Magdalene, to name a few...then again, it also shows there were wicked men who happened to be Jewish, i.e., the priests who were (if you have read your New Testament and trusted in its authority) of evil hearts toward Jesus. What this film does is take it out of its Western European pageantry that has been so self evident in Hollywood and placed the true story of Jesus' death and resurrection back to its Jewish roots. If you really wish to know more about the Bible, and about what the Bible says what happens, read it. But please, don't throw demons in where there aren't any in the first place. The film does not assault Jews. Plain and simple.I hope that you watch this film and consider who Jesus is. Who Jesus really is.

Never has a movie so violently assaulted my senses, affected my behavior, changed my thinking.There are many things to reflect on and talk about after seeing it, the group I was with went to a coffee place and discussed the movie for some time afterwards. There are many symbolic things in the film, and a couple of people that night had already seen the movie twice, even though it'd only been out two days, and they commented on things they caught the second viewing that'd been missed the first time around.There is a lot of blood. Christ's blood. He died for the sins of the world and shed his blood for humanity. That is the basic premise and story line. This isn't the 'Matrix', a great film with a Christology all it's own and ton's of symbolism, this is the shocking and offensive story of what Jesus did. Raw and offensive and ugly. He died naked and beaten on a cross of wood.If I would have a complaint about the depiction, as horrible and brutal as it was, was that the Christ was shown with the obligatory wrapping at the waist. In the movie 'Schindler's List' one of the great (in the sense of effecting the emotion of the viewer) scenes was when the prisoners had to line up naked and there, in shame and humiliation, await death. I'm curious as to why full frontal male nudity was used there but not here as it would have been more faithful to the text. However, it's a small complaint, the scenes were plenty graphic and shocking and I believe that the film followed scripture pretty faithfully with the occasional artistic license not getting too much in the way.I'm probably in the minority here, wondering why the movie wasn't even more graphic, but I'll stand my ground on that one. If we are going to see what we did to Jesus, at least from a traditional viewpoint, we might as well take as much of the medicine as we can. For those that don't understand the traditional Christian viewpoint of what the cross means, it means this: Jesus hung there for you. That's the story, whether you believe it or not or care to see it depicted or not, that's it. That's the story that Mel Gibson, I believe, wanted to show on the screen.

Most great people have focused on the return of Christ from the dead, this is the imporatant point. His return and the salvation of mankind. I think Gibson believes that we should all be reminded how brutal Christ's death was, but this is disrespectful to his image and completely disregards what this event meant for mankind.

Heavily criticized for it's brutal depiction of the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, and maligned by some for encouraging anti semetism, I found it powerful and very moving, if disturbing. It is a testament to Mel Gibson's vision, and perseverance that NO major Hollywood studio picked up this picture, which was self funded by Mr Gibson at a cost of around $30 million. The fact that the dialogue is chiefly aramaic (the movie is subtitled throughout) could also be seen as enough to discourage a lot of viewers, but there is no doubt that this is powerful film making at it's best. Perhaps enjoy is the wrong word to use in how I felt after the movie which is violent and unforgiving in showing Christ's persecution and eventual execution on the cross, but it is compelling, absorbing and emotionally charged. The success of the picture (I feel) lies in the what has been the chief subject of critisicm, the blow by blow punishment and torture the viewer cannot help but share with the main character. However, perhaps this is the strength of the movie, and I believe Gibson's aim, in showing what has always been hinted at, or happened off screen in other films of the genre. Put simply, it is saying that knowing or saying that Christ suffered and died for our sins is not enough, this is how, and why, open, graphic and painful. Not a movie I would recommend for the squeamish or sensitive, and certainly NOT for children (of any age).

As the theater card commercials eased into the filmed commercials into the coming attraction commercials, you felt excitement and dread slowly fill the theater. By showtime it grew to full, a good house for a night dominated for years by must see TV. Murmuring, chomping, bustling, and normal theater activity halted literally from the first scene where, without a title credit, you are placed in the garden as Jesus weeps and prays before His arrest and trial, challenged and victorious over an androgynous devil figure.In the two hours that follow director Mel Gibson, and his stars including Jim Cavieziel as Jesus and Maia Morganstern as His mother Mary, create what can only be considered a religious horror film. They use all trademarks of that genre: slow motion recreations of gore and brutality, tangible depictions and battles between good and evil (including demonic chase and possession), classically-based cinematography and a brooding John Debney musical score. All this in as historically accurate and visually beautiful a setting as such a film could take place. This is not the horror fantasy of Freddy Krueger slashing nubile teens, pointing to his glove and snarling, This...is God. The verbal taunts and physical punishment lie on Jesus, the Saving Victim Christians see as God made man.No one will leave this film unmoved. I and many around me cried seeing a bludgeoned Jesus comforted by (and comforting) His Mother; their scenes on Jesus' walk to Calvary and at His Crucifixion are as simple and heartfelt as the beatings are excruciating. Gibson uses his considerable cinematic skill to slow down and intensify, rather than deflect, violence Christ suffers.His blood, which Christians believe washed sin away, dominates this film. It splatters on His torturers, oozes through the nails on His Cross, spurts from His side a Roman soldier pierces kneeling before Jesus' Cross. (You wish Gibson would have allowed one of those centurions the line, Truly this was the Son of God.) This film validates someone fully man as well as fully God suffered for our sins, and felt this unbearable pain doing so. (This, however, does not justify a rather sickening scene at the Crucifixion involving a crow which represents the film's most unnecessary violence and which even those supporting the film would decry.)No one will leave this film unblamed for Jesus' death. It is no more Sanhedrin determination, nor Pontius Pilate's indecision nor his soldiers' sadism nor Herod's drunken curiosity (the scenes between Jesus and Herod get as close to comic relief as The Passion allows, and it's not that close) which seals Jesus' fate. Through flashbacks of Jesus' ministry Gibson shows they - and we - are responsible for the suffering Jesus came to endure. (To that end, you wonder if Gibson could not have included a flashback to Jesus' rebuking Peter - Get thee behind me, you Satan! - after hearing Jesus announce His death and resurrection.)The showing I attended saw many people leave the screening, waiting in the lobby from the intensity of what they saw and felt. The audience left afterward stunned silent, the only film I'd seen to prompt such reaction. (Gibson shows the Resurrection, earth's happiest day on which Christian faith is built, as a determined moment of mission rather than of celebration, complete with martial music.)No one can leave this film ambivalent about Jesus or His mission. Watching it, seeing his pain and vicariously enduring it, you must either accept Him as Messiah or dismiss Him as a madman.

As for the controversy over whether the Jewish religion is insulted, I can't say that there is anything obviously hostile. The only danger comes from simple readers of the bible who believe that if not for the Jews, Christ would not have died. I keep reading the bible and see that the death of Christ was part of the plan, not a surprise ending. At least that part of the story hasn't changed in all of my years of study. History also shows us that no culture or ethnicity is free of having done sinful harm to their fellow living being. So hopefully those who would throw stones at the Jews will only come from those who are free from sin.Overall, I would highly recommend this movie.

Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.The Passion of the Christ has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part.

I come from a Christian background and was not enthralled with the film.

I make it an annual event to watch it as a personal reminder of what Jesus Christ did for me nearly 2000 years ago.Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus of Nazareth is one filled with love, serenity and, yes, passion. You can see the love of Jesus for all people in his eyes when he speaks. You can see the hurt when he is treated unjustly. If Jim Caviezel did so awesome a job portraying Jesus, one can only imagine the Lord's expression when the events in this film actually happened a couple millennia ago.Based on the Gospels and Roman and Jewish history, Mel Gibson has crafted a well-executed account on what Jesus Christ went through on our behalf.Many complain the film is nothing but sheer gore. Yes, it is bloody, but if you look into Roman history and discovered what Roman scourging and crucifixion entailed, you'd find Gibson's film is bang on. He also made the right choice to display what happened how it happened instead of just putting a few scratch marks on Jesus and a robe splashed with red paint like other films have done. By seeing Jesus murdered as He was, the audience feels the impact of that day long ago. It forces them to pause and reflect.This film serves as a reminder for believers in Jesus, and serves, hopefully, as a touching account of the ultimate sacrifice from the ultimate Love to those who don't believe.It would take a terribly cold heart to not be moved by this film.Very recommended.A.P.

Mesa,"[1, 3]","After seeing The Passion of The Christ I walked away more of a believer and reflecting upon my own path in my life while saying, Look what WE did to him !...Never did I believed or blamed the Jewish people or the Romans solely responsible for the death of Jesus. Nor did I walk away from the film hating Jewish people. Utterly ridiculous. Also, those who know the teachings or the bible so well have forgotten that it was a prophecy that even Jesus knew he had to fulfill for humankind... We as a human race(regardless of creed or ethnicity), a collective people crucified him. Further more, I used to think of Jesus only as a divine and spiritual higher power; I had forgotten how human he was also. The Passion of the Christ reaffirmed this... Further more, for someone such as 60 Minutes' commentator Andy Rooney to say that he would never or not subject himself to watching such a violent or gory film while calling Gibson a wacko only shows the magnitude of ignorance he and others share about The Passion of the Christ and Mel Gibson ! Rooney should ask himself if Jesus was okey dokey with subjecting himself to a cruel and horrific death !...Wonder if Gisbon is saying at this point , Can't satisfy everyone !...and that is not the point of this film and obviously his on the recreation of the last twelve hours of Jesus' life. If it is too brutal, too violent, too graphic, then those viewers need to get real ! There is nothing gratuitous,overboard or overblown. I have yet to hear anyone on the contrary say that they have found evidence or proof that the torture Jesus endured was a walk through the park. Also, I'm sure there is some jealousy and resentment amongst the powerful film studio moguls(including those who did not want to touch or back up Gibson's project) who only wished they would have had half the vision and [guts] Mel Gibson possessed in directing The Passion of the Christ! Hats off to Gibson and the casting director for utilizing the gifted talents of international actors and not Hollywood's popular elite. Some may think Mel is wacko but after all there is a method to his madness or madness to his method that yields brilliant works such as Braveheart and now The Passion of the Christ...The passion for Gisbon's directing and vision surely comes through !Now, the film itself is a masterpiece in technical terms of cinematography, acting, costume and set design, special effects and soundtrack...Regardless if the dialogue was Aramaic or Latin, the subtitles did not hinder at all the action or watching the actors on screen. Nor do they deter the understanding of the story. The imagery varies from simply rich, panoramic, to haunting and nightmarish (involving scenes of the devil or his minions)! The artistic and skillful use of flashbacks to coincide with pivotal scenes (though every scene is practically pivotal) cannot be forgotten. One flashback involving Jesus as a beautiful and angelic curly headed toddler and a young Virgin Mother running to comfort him from a fall will put a knot in anyone's throat.It is one of the most emotional flashbacks regardless if one is a parent or not... The image is strong and will stay in the mind for time to come.I did not view this film in the hopes of being entertained in the regular or superficial sense of the word. I went to be further educated. I was.Way beyond what I had expected. If you have not seen this film, forget any controversy or preconceived notions.Take any controversy, negative reviews out of the equation, and even forget Mel Gibson directed this for just 2 hours and see the film as it stands on its own...If you can walk away from this film extracting something positive and taken to heart from the viewing experience, and it is an experience(whether spiritual, educational, or other ways) then count yourself amongst the enlightened ones and not those who have become outraged or bittered. Don't become caught up in the controversies and lose sight of what The Passion of the Christ is about; Christ.Just see it !",5,Just See It !,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",-0.0033

In America and the world today, the divide between those who have taken upon themselves the name of Christ and those who haven't has never been clearer. To believers, The Passion is a painful but ultimately moving depiction of the suffering, death and resurrection of their Savior. To non-believers, it is a violent portrayal of a mythical event.The film itself is well made. As remarked previously, the subtitles are not distracting in the least. Most viewers are familiar enough with the story to figure out who Mary is and who Pontius Pilate is. The cinematography is beautiful in most places and the film doesn't drag on. Theologically, I found the film utterly lacking in anti-Semitism and a bit overly Catholic (esp. in relation to Mary), but Gibson is a devout Catholic and this was his dime, so I was able to move past that. The extra-Biblical material did not detract significantly from the Gospel accounts to the point of concern.That leads to the much discussed and maligned violence of the film.It makes sense that the New Testament goes into little detail regarding the actual crucifixion and scourging. No one of that time needed a description as they likely had seen it first hand on many occasions. The reader of that time knew all too well the horrors inflicted by scourging and the agonizing death on a cross. To the genteel viewers of today, accustomed to stylized violence and gore being fed to them via CGI, it WAS absolutely necessary to show the up close and personal violence, inflicted by one person upon another, to really understand the pain that Christ suffered on our behalf. I doubt I will watch this DVD over and over again, but I certainly think that it bears watching again and I will buy it just to spite those who blindly opposed it without ever seeing the movie.I laugh ruefully at those reviewers who sadly try to make light of the Passion with crude humor. Not because they are funny, but because it is so typical of those who do not believe. I don't find it offensive, but I am afraid God will. He will not be mocked, which I suspect will be discovered to the chagrin of the mockers someday.

70,A2VMT89TCSF105,310263662,Ashtar Command Seeker,"[3, 8]","Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, while undoubtedly a well-done and stunning movie, is also thinly veiled propaganda for traditionalist Catholicism. It's remarkable that so many evangelicals have expressed support for it. But then, many evangelicals and similar groups co-operate with the Moonie Jonathan Wells. So perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised by their opportunism towards Gibson?The traditionalist Catholic slant of The Passion of the Christ is obvious in many ways. Some of the situations depicted in the movie aren't found in the Gospels, but in the visions of a Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich. Others seem to be Gibson's own invention, but they are consistent with Catholic tradition, as when Satan mocks the Madonna and the Child. The whole concentration on the violent suffering of Jesus also looks very Catholic. So is the use of the Latin language. Jesus speaks to Pontius Pilate in Latin, although Greek would have been more likely. While Pilate was a Roman, the lingua franca of the East Mediterranean was Greek. There is no indication in the Gospels that Jesus used an interpreter when speaking to Pilate, which suggests that the Gospel writers assumed their conversation to be in Greek (which is also the language of the Gospels themselves.) So why the use of the Latin language? Presumably because Latin is the traditional liturgical language of the Catholic Church. Indeed, much of the conflict between traditionalist Catholics and Vatican II Catholics has been over the use of the traditional Latin mass. I also noticed that the Latin spoken by Pilate and Jesus in the Gibson's movie sounds like Italian! Apparently, ecclesiastical Latin does have an Italian pronunciation.But the most contentious issue concerning the movie is, of course, the real or perceived anti-Semitism. The Jews of the Sanhedrin certainly look like anti-Semitic stereotypes. Herod Antipas is depicted as an effeminate gay. Also, Pilate is cast in the role of unwilling executioner, as in the Gospel of John, the most anti-Jewish of the four gospels. Of course, it's difficult to make a pro-Jewish traditional Christian movie about Jesus. Traditional Christianity isn't pro-Jewish, anymore than Orthodox Judaism is pro-Christian. However, Gibson should at least have excised the more blatant stereotypes. That Gibson later made anti-Semitic remarks during the infamous DUI incident, hardly helped his case, despite his public apologies to the Jewish communities.The Passion of the Christ is an artistic achievement as a movie, but due to its problematic contents, I can only give it two stars.

I know the Stations of the Cross as well as anyone who grew up Catholic, and I know the Gospels as well any Baptist. However, like Chicago Sun-Times movie critic Roger Ebert, I was connected with the reality of the suffering Christ went through in a very real way. It is just a movie, and the guy on the cross wasn't Jesus. But it caused me to think about Jesus in a whole new way.I knew this was coming. I have read dozens of articles on this and tuned into every show on the movie. Not good enough. It still hit me. It wasn't the blood that spattered on my face, but the love that spattered on my heart. I sat in that theater as a Christian who believes, but I experienced something very heavy that evening. There is no separating my Christian beliefs from my reaction to the movie.The subtitles take nothing from the experience, and add to the focus on the movie's story rather its dialogue.The beginning sets the dramatic tone, delivering us into the Garden of Gesthemene as Jesus prays. Judas kisses him softly on the cheek, and a fight ensues between the posse of soldiers and Jesus' disciples. Jesus himself waits, and even heals the ear wounded by Peter, whom Jesus rebukes. The following events include a trial and flogging. Jesus never raises a hand or comment against his accusers, nor does he deny their accusations that he claims to be God. Pilate is torn politically, wanting to do the right thing and wanting to save his own position. Unwilling to assert a position, he lays the call onto the town's citizen who are in a blood-frenzy.What grabbed me in the movie were unexpected scenes, like Jesus and Mary connecting sight on the Via Dolorosa. Jesus stumbles, and the movie flashes back to Mary running to a four year old Jesus who stumbled in a field. She picks him up, holds him motherly. Now, Jesus is 33, all battered and worn from a vicious, sadistic abuse by Roman soldiers. Mary runs to him. He speaks to her, whispering cryptically, See mother, I make all things new, and does his best to press on. It is his cross to carry, and he raises to his feet.The ending is ingeniously subtle. In some ways, they are the 30 most important seconds of the movie in which it all comes together. Every drop of blood, every rejected silver piece, and every cross-dragged furrow in the road to Golgotha comes together in probably the most understated yet complete climax to a movie I have ever seen.I understand now why people bought tickets for friends, dragged people to see it. I expected to be blown away, but I didn't expect to be hit at my core on so many different levels.The movie isn't perfect. Some scenes took more poetic license than can be historically supported. Herod was decadently different than I expected, and perhaps the least like the real Herod. Herod's lascivious persona here matches the essence, if not the exact personality. His reactions to the Christ situation were consistent with the Bible, and add texture to Pilate's dilemma.Some vague scenes confused me, like when Satan carries a grimacing, sneering man-child. However, as Satan's gender is not important to his evil nature, the androgyny holds up.A knowledge of Christian scripture will augment an understanding of the film's secondary flashback scenes. The movie does stand on its own, and meets the vision of its controversial director. Whether the audience is a devout believer, or seeing the movie as an artistic portrayal of history's most influential figure, the movie will work. I expect it to be rerun in theaters every Easter season.I fully recommend this movie.Anthony Trendleditor, HungarianBookstore.com",5,"Cataclysmic, Profound Movie Bigger Than Controversy",1078704000,"03 8, 2004",0.0035

So, I gave up and declared that I'll only watch movies made before the end of the year 2000. There is a strong reason in my declaration, and The Passion of the Christ reaffirms my stance. The film brings out the worst of everything. It's the fake acting. It's the constant overt melodrama in everything that the characters do, feel, think, or speak. It's the free-all ultra-graphic torture. It's the unrealistic depiction of what a human being is capable of. It's the impossibility of physics.

Jesus' teachings, who he was as a man and a philosopher, were only shown in tiny bits and pieces.I thought something would come out of watching this 2+ hours of film, but I got nothing. All that it depicts was ghastly violence from beginning to end. I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. Cruelty shown in this movie would damage their psyche.Since this movie was devoted to the last 12 hours of Jesus' life, I was surprised that it didn't mentioned Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent Jew (and a secret disciple of Jesus) who begged Pontius Pilate to release Jesus' body to him for proper burial after his death. It was Joseph of Arimathea who wrapped Jesus' body in the finest cloth and laid him in his own family's tomb, a man-made cave in his garden. The subsequent resurrection of Jesus from this cave became the beginning of Christianity.The entire film is spoken in foreign language (Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew) with English subtitle, which I thought the actors did very well.In the end, I didn't understand the purpose of this movie. Very disappointed - especially since the DVD didn't even have special features of how the movie was made.(For those people who are interested in how Jesus spent his last hours without the Hollywood drama, I recommend Discovery Channel's Who was Jesus?

It was not an anti-Semitic blood feast nor did I feel it necessarily celebrated violence for violence sake. It was violent, that is true, but in Gibson (and the audience's) mind, it was not mindless nor gratuitous, but an essential (maybe THE essential) aspect of the story. It was, more than anything, a cinematic - not a spiritual - experience. I might add, I have enjoyed Mel Gibson in almost every movie he has ever starred.This was as personal a story as one can get in that every nuance, thought and word was conceived in Gibson's mind - the Bible was only a prop. As he said, this is NOT the life of Jesus but the story of the Passion, those last days of his life. The idea of using Aramaic and Latin was stunning but somehow right. (By the way, if he had wanted to be historically accurate he would have used Aramaic and Greek - almost no Roman citizens spoke Latin in their daily life.)This is a pre-Vatican II Christ, the Savior of power and majesty who dies for the sins of us all. It overlooks the contradictory Gospel tales, papering over the obvious problems one encounters trying to reconcile the many stories that have come down to us from oral then written form. Gibson did not follow any one of the versions rigidly but instead created his own, a distillation of Catholic, Bibical and historical traditions.This is also the story of Gibson's own journey from believer to wayward sinner and back to the fold, much as he did in SIGNS. The score was particularly effective and even if one does not share the supernatural aspects of the story, it is powerful and wrenching.

Been quite a long time since I've written a review for Amazon.com, and finally I've written something that will rock with your head and eat your soul like my others. Here's a review I've put off writing for quite awhile because I really wanted to wait for the hype to die down. And after reading so many different viewpoints on this website and others, it's caused quite a stir indeed. Well, here we go.The film largely follows that of the catholic faith's Stations of the Cross and while I'm not too entirely familiar with it, I know that it details the passion (literally meaning suffering) of Jesus Christ and finally being nailed on the cross. Mel Gibson himself is catholic and had this idea incubating in his head for years and I'll tell you what, this film really got to me. It's wondrous cinematography (remember the film The Black Stallion? Same guy!), authentic languages of Aramaic and Latin (which by the way, Aramaic was used by the common people, Latin by the Romans. Just thought you'd find that interesting.), and the wonderful performances by everyone involved, especially Jim Caviezel as Jesus. I previously saw him in Frequency and already knew he was a good actor, but this movie proved that he is indeed a GREAT actor. Monica Bellucci, who played in the Matrix films and played a whore in that stupid Brotherhood of the Wolf film, is Mary Magdalene here and also turns in a fine performance here.Gibson actually did some nice artistic touches here, especially with the flashbacks. I think this is where some Christians get pissed off because he took a few liberties. Example: in the Bible when Jesus is tempted in the Garden of Gethsemane, we see Satan (presumably) tempting him to not fulfill the prophecy. While the Bible never outright says it is Satan, I found it very plausible. Satan is regarded as the evil spirit, or the fallen angel, who tempts us through sin. It would seem very likely to me that Satan wouldn't want Jesus to die for us. Gibson also used the original sin idea, showing Satan with the ugly baby, and also with Judas being shameful and eventually killing himself for what he had done.My only complaint with this is I wanted to see a little more to the resurrection than we saw. I wanted to see everyone's faces when they would see Jesus alive and well. Oh well, I guess. After all, no matter how well you make a religious film, it can't be perfect (and plus, that wasn't really the focus of this film).So why did it affect me like it did? Well, I may be the strong religious person that I am (and loves heavy metal, how about that?), but in growing up in the Protestant faith, I never really concentrated on Jesus' suffering; after all, without the resurrection, it would've been a moot point. However, when watching the film, all I could really think of was He did THAT for me? I never really thought about what he went through, and this film changed my thinking forever. I'm not sure if I would outright tell you to see this movie because it's very graphic and poignant; however, if you do, I HIGHLY suggest you watch it with an open mind because I've known people to hate it just because of their opinions on what the Bible is and so forth. If you don't like the film because of its graphic nature, then you are well in your right. If you don't like it based on your preconceptions of what Jesus went through or it disagrees with your religious opinion (for example, I have a friend who didn't like it just because he thought Jesus was totally human and not spiritually the Son of God and therefore could not live during the crucifixion.), then that is simply your opinion but I still can't help but feel like you are allowing those preconceptions to override the fact that this is indeed just a film, and the filmmaker is showing his deepest love for Christ.It's not a film for everybody to enjoy and even I find it hard to enjoy as entertainment.

Unless all the actors did it for free and every penny was donated to charity, this is blasphemous exploitation.

82,AHKOPVTQ3IEBL,310263662,Baltic Books Vic,"[9, 12]","See the movie! Buy the DVD.Okay everyone. We finally went to see the controversial Mel Gibson portrayal of the last day of Jesus life (the events of that day are commonly called The Passion).Here are some of my thoughts:* Not nearly as violent as Saving Private Ryan, or any number of other movies featuring cinematic realism today. Having said that, there is no way around it, this is a violent film, but I don't think an NC-17 is justified in this case as suggested by some film critics.The thing is, for hundreds of years the death of Christ as occurring in a crucifixion has been so sterilized that people (I'm talking to Christians mostly) attribute a kind of Santa Claus or Easter Bunny mythology to what Jesus went through. This portrays the crucifixion accurately from a realistic standpoint verified by the Journal of the American Medical Association. (The Journal of the American Medical Association, March 21, 1986, Volume 256).* Accurate to the biographical record written by two eye witnesses to Jesus-- Matthew and John; and one historian-- Luke, and the record probably dictated to Mark by Peter. The film is based on these historical records, commonly called the Gospels. From my viewpoint as a guy with a degree in Bible and Theology, they closely follow the events.Obviously there is some cinematic license taken to make an interesting screenplay, but even in those moments I felt the film was true to the spirit of the records.* Anti-Semitic? I don't think so. There were several criticisms leveled against the film. One was that Jews were always shown in a poor light. That is not true. While the key leaders that brought Jesus to trial were accusing him and probably inciting their people in order to get a death sentence, it is accurate to the biographical record.Having said that, it is most important to note: Outside of the Roman occupiers of Jerusalem, every person portrayed was a Jew. At no time did Jesus or any of his followers call for any kind of judgment against the Jewish leadership. Plus, at least two of the Jewish leaders were clearly shown to support Jesus. Additionally, Jesus was a Jew, as was his mother, all his followers and every person supporting and sympathizing with him.Following the crucifixion the Bible clearly shows his followers stayed active in the local Jerusalem temple. (cf: Acts 2; Acts 3). They remained Jewish, and actively maintained their temple worship for at least several years. To say the film is anti-Semite is to say it calls judgment on Jesus followers.* His blood be on us and our children is a famous line in the gospels and critics cry out that this line alone is enough to incite violence against Jews. However it does not appear in the current film version (unless it is an untranslated line in Aramaic or Hebrew). This line is one of the great and beautiful ironies of the gospels. Matthew 27:24-26 presents these words as the crowd calls for Jesus crucifixion. The irony is while it seems that people-leaders are reckless calling a curse or judgment on themselves for Jesus death, the truth is that is exactly what allows all people to enjoy the extended forgiveness and favor with God. The Bible clearly teaches it is Jesus blood that is the means to forgiveness. The blood is the vehicle of mercy, not judgment.* Jon Voight incorrectly cites film techniques employed by Nazi's in the 1930s. Actor and director, Jon Voight this week on CNBC and MSNBC implied that Gibson used techniques designed to vilify Jews. He stated frames of Jews were interspersed with frames of demonic figures, suggesting these are a means to demonify Jews.Voight needs to see the film again and take another look. The instances where this took place were as Judas was in the process of his betrayal subsequently overwrought with the guilt of his actions. He was clearly demonized (rightly so) and some images were clearly hallucinated. In another scene you see a demonic figure with the satan-character. You never one time see a demonic figure linked to any Jewish leader or person of any prominence.* You should read the biographies (gospels) of Jesus life before seeing this film-- or certainly after you see it. The film can stand for itself as a piece of cinematic art, however it assumes you are very familiar with the history of Jesus life, and hopefully the prophetic Jewish writings of the Old Testament that are a setting for the coming of a Messiah that would save all people from sins. Each biography presents the life of Jesus from a different viewpoint. However, if you do not have any background in the Bible, you might want to read a synoptic version--one that has incorporated all four biographies into one chronological record also called a harmony of the gospels.A free copy of one of these is available online called the Book of Hope.

It is superbly shot, the cinematography literally breath-taking in its intensity and ability to add muscular heft to the familiar story of how Jesus came to fulfill the prophecy through his divine sacrifice on behalf of all mankind. The movie-goer is sure to be transformed by the magnitude of the oft-told and retold tale of how the events of the final twelve hours focused on the ways in which Jesus deliberately serves himself up as the sacrificial lamb for the manifest sins of the world, offering all humans the opportunity to re-establish their contact with the divine from whom they had been estranged.Indeed, I found myself almost speechless after viewing the film, and was not quite sure to what extent it was a result of the power of the film's message as opposed to the graphically violent context in which the tale is told. Herein lies the single criticism one can level against the film, which despite many worries from bystanders that it was laced with virulent anti-Semitism, seems to clearly blame all sinners (ergo, all of us) for the sacrifice of God's son on the cross. Yet Mel Gibson's sure hand is both able and accurate, and the violence shows how carnal man greets the divine, and how we react to the message of hope and salvation; through unspeakable cruelty and gratuitous violence. So, while this is indeed a very violent movie, the murderous acts depicted quite graphically have to be taken in the context of the supernatural events transpiring, as a kind of carnal counterpoint to the ethereal repose with which Jesus bears all of the acts visited upon him. At one point He tells Mary (After he has stumbled under the burden of the cross) &quot;Behold, mother, I make all thing anew! This was, for me at least, a quite stunning reminder of the godly forces at work amidst all the violence and carnage.This is a very personal interpretation of the final twelve hours of Christ's life on earth leading to His crucifixition. From the moment it opens in the solitude of the Garden at Gethsemane, one is immediately aware of the battle ongoing between good and evil, as the devil (cleverly presented as a stunning if malevolent woman with a masculine voice) attempts to dissuade Jesus from attempting what he about to undertake. From this it is obvious He is doing this for all mankind, Jews and Gentiles alike, and that we are all to blame, through our unremitting addiction to carnality and sinfulness, for the evil manifested in the world. This is a fantastic film, one that is definitely not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, and definitely not something I would suggest subjecting a child to.

On the one hand there are the faithful believers who rever him as the Son Of God & people who think he was merely a man who the Bible and the Church made a diety of in order to scare people into embracing their beliefs with half-witted prophecies of hellfire & brimstone.THE PASSION OF CHRIST is the third feature to be Directed by Mel Gibson, in fact the film was a sheer labor of love for him as he also co-produced & co-wrote the film (which is in Gaelic & Aramaic with English subtitles).THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST focuses on Jesus's last hours on Earth, from the Garden Of Gethsemane, the Last Supper, Christ's betrayal by Judas, Peter's denial of him through to extensive scenes of his trial for blasphemy and crucifixion (which makes up a good portion of the film). Jim Cavizel (billed as James here), best known for his roles in movies such as FREQUENCY & THE THIN RED LINE gives the performance of his career as Jesus. There's only one problem; and for me this really blunted the full impact of the film somewhat: for two hours I saw Jim Caviezel, the actor; PLAYING Jesus Christ.Depending on your beliefs you will either love or despise this movie. I thought it was good but I found it kind of sick how people can only enter heaven by worshipping Christ, God's Only Son. I found it especially interesting after reading Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code last year, and seeing that the book HUMANISED Jesus. Interestingly, it's alleged the church covered up evidence Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had a daughter named Sarah. Apparently the myth of Magdalene being a prostitute may have been the result of a smear campaign by the Catholic Church; and that in actuality Christ had blood descendants. Not a good image for the Son Of God, is it? But wait, when I was a Catholic as a child I was told we were ALL God's children! How about some common sense? How about THE TRUTH!In all fairness, I actually quite liked the movie. There are good performances, the film is beautifully shot and also THE PASSION OF CHRIST is truly a ground breaking film. I think this may be the first Christian exploitation movie! And boy, is it bloody! This is the first film to show the crucifixion as the disgusting spectacle it was. We see Jesus be bloodily whipped with barbs & having a crown of thorns nailed to his head (after Pilate spares a raving lunatic from crucifixion in favor of Christ, which I considered rather odd), Christ being forced to carry his cross up the Mount, falling several times along the way, being aided by Simon Of Cyrene and having blood cleaned from his face by Veronica. It's all very vividly created but all the film did was further reinforce my reasons for lapsing from the Catholic faith. What God would do this to his own son? Not MY idea of God. My God has a sense of humor (In fact there IS a scene here where Jesus displays humor when he is making a table & talking to his mother. Where's the humor in the Bible?)Also, I could not write this review without pointing out one of the biggest ironies in the history of NZ's censorship laws I have EVER come across. SPCS, the people who are still trying to ban BAISE MOI & VISITOR Q (Their motto should be If at first you don't succeed: Fail, Fail & Fail again) are lobbying to have the films R16 rating in NZ LOWERED so 13-15 year olds can see it with a parent! Because this is JESUS! The violence is JUSTIFIED! Not only that; but how can that classification be ENFORCED? It's beyond a joke & especially ironic considering this co-stars Monica Bellucci of IRREVERSIBLE! (NZ seems to be the only country in the western world where IRREVERSIBLE is not getting a DVD release! So I legally can't buy it! I love NZ).So I'll finish off my review with a question: Why is it supposedly OK according to SPCS for kids to see this (Personally I think the movie would give them nightmares) but, as I've said before adults can't watch what they choose of their own free will? A classic example of the pot calling the kettle black, if you ask me.How much you enjoy (enjoy being a loose term here given the movie's gruesome subject matter) THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST boils down to your personal belief system, and will be interpreted and discussed in countless different ways. In a nutshell though, three star review aside; this really is a movie you should see for yourself, regardless of your religious beliefs: Christian, Jew, Muslim, atheist, agnostic it doesn't matter.

Perhaps I am just not getting it. I always understood that the most central point of the Jesus story was that he arose from the dead, not that he was tortured to death. So it suprises me that the film would concentrate almost entirely on this one aspect of the story, rather than on the resurrection part. That it does not, smacks of violence-as-a-marketing-tool to me. When all the hoopla has died down, it will be interesting to see how much money Gibson will have made off of the suffering of his savior.I have to say that I am more than a little shocked at the fawning tone I have seen in these reviews, particularly from Christians. The enthusiastic way in which they are taking joy in watching someone being slowly tortured to death is sickening; and exactly the same sort of bloodthirsty eagerness that the ancient Romans displayed when they watched animals and people (including Christians) being executed in the arena. The fact that there is a religious purpose to the film does not excuse this. I wonder if this movie were made with the exact same types of scenes, but without the religious content, how many of reviewers would still sing its praises.

I don't care what your minister says, allowing anyone under thirteen years of age to see this film is WRONG. It's an incredibly brutal and violent film and there are many alternatives if you want young people to see a movie about the crucifixion of Christ. I know that kids these days get exposed to lots of violent movies, TV shows and video games, but if you're even thinking of letting your child see this watch it first by yourself, then decide.Now that I have that over with, on with the review of the DVD. Mel Gibson made a technically brilliant film, from the costumes, sets, languages and the like, but he didn't take a great deal of risks with this movie. The film is beautifully shot, but the characters take a back seat to the unrelenting violence. The depiction of Satan is particularly one dimensional, with virtually no interaction with Jesus except for a brief exchange relatively early in the film. The rest of the time, the devil skulks around looking very creepy and sinister, but ultimately comes off as a spooky but ineffectual piece of background.A comparison begs to be made to The Last Temptation of Christ. In that movie, Satan tempts Jesus by showing him just what he's giving up by allowing himself to be crucified for the sins of humanity - the love of a woman, a family, in essence giving up the chance at a normal life. You realize the gravity and scope of that sacrifice and are compelled to admire the choice he made.In contrast, all you get with Gibson's film is a portrayal of the betrayal and subsequent slow, brutal murder of a human being. The relatively accurate glimpse of life two thousand years ago is a bonus, but I feel that Mel could've made this much more than it ended up being. It shocked me, but it didn't go much deeper than that.Considering the subject of the film, that's pretty sad.",2,A potentially powerful movie reduced to a splatter film...,1094256000,"09 4, 2004",-0.3802
100,A48THA5X4OUAB,310263662,Billyjack D'Urberville,"[4, 7]","After about 1/4 or 1/3 of the way into this movie, one begins to wonder hard what the fuss was about. The fact is, unlike Gibson's previous two major historical outings (Braveheart & The Patriot) this movie is about 80 % historical sources (in this case the broad outline of Matthew and other synoptics, with dialogue therefrom), 20 % the director. The other 2 movies had a less than 50% historicism & were well over 50% personally interpretive -- and at very critical points. In my view these last two directorial attempts by Gibson were flawed for such reasons -- given very questionable historical interpretations in both. These were the trepidations I had before viewing this movie, rather than the rest of the unbelievable hoopla.The fact is, lacking either Roman or Jewish sources for Christ's passion (although both the Roman Tacitus and the Jewish Talmud admit Christ was actually put to death during Pilate's tenure) there is no detailed historical source other than the gospels for this story, like it or not. Coldly viewed, the film is thus no different than several other films which more or less rigorously follow some pre-existing text -- putting aside the question whether the text is fact or fiction, ie. Kubrick's Barry Lyndon ( historical novel), Fellini's Satyricon (ancient book that may or may not be historically based), The Bounty (mixed fact and fiction). It is virtually impossible to imagine a filmic treatment of any text that does not have at least a 10 to 15% dose of interpretation from the maker. So the criticism that has followed is necessarily not based on the Gibson interpretation, but against the gospel itself. The argument, necessarily then, must be that the gospel should no longer be represented filmically, for some reason. This is a political question, since such censorship could only be enforced by political means. Despite many expressed fears, such a result -- outright censorship -- is hardly likely in the United States, now or in the forseeable future.In brief, if didacticism is properly understood as the artist's overlay of personal vision and interpretation -- and not what the artist's personal creed (religious or political) happens to be -- the film is much less didactic than Gibson's other ventures into historical presentation, and for that matter much less didactic than the vast majority of other film. The current criticism, again, necessarily is with Gibson's own doctrine; rationally speaking it could not be with the fact he has one (since any honest person will admit that every adult has some sort of a belief system in the broad sense of the word).The historicism of Passion is visually obvious to any rational viewer, believer or unbeliever. To a disinterested viewer, ie., one without any particular religious axe to grind, the movie resembles nothing so much as an attempt to portray the confusion and cruelty of the ancient world in a highly realistic and authentic manner. Why this should not be a valid enterprise for an American realist would be hard for critics to say; they avoid the issue. Research on the institution of Roman crucifixion and scourging demonstrates that this sort of scholarship much more informs the making of Passion than, say, Gibson's use of the Catholic mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich, which while it has been much vaunted is really only window dressing here. The long and short of it is that the scourging (the truly new element in this passion film presentation, never previously so fully rendered in other films about Christ) is highly informed realism consistent with scholarship and with the reason for this scourging, in Christ's case. See Zugibe, Forensic and Clinical Knowledge of the Practice of Crucifixion (Turin 2000); Zaninotto, The Shroud and Roman Crucifixion: A Historical Overview (Turin 2000).The realism and subtlety of the portrayal of Roman leaders and the Roman system in this film far outdistances the best of similar recent ventures, ie. Gladiator. It matches the highest standard I know of in this area, Kubrick's Spartacus. I doubt Gibson's Pilate will ever be improved upon; it is worth the price of admission. You may like this or that disciple in the film more, but take a close look at Pilate if you can stand it; this guy is really us.I would also frankly admit that the Jewish authority figures are not presented with the same subtlety. It would be a better film if they had been. But their milieu in this film is not presented as malicious in any sense, rather highly confused (which Pilate points out). In any event the figure who is quite obviously the hero of the film, in the full classical sense, Jesus, not only reinforces Pilate's verdict on their behavior -- they know not what they do -- but also explicitly forgives them. A person attempting to pin an anti-Semetic didacticism onto this film therefore ignores the most pointed statements on the subject by the story's focus and hero -- a most dubious venture. Of course, it is well known that the anti-Passion campaign has only been successful by innuendo, guilt by association (Gibson's father), and other tactics unworthy of serious discourse.If one is reduced to keeping count of such things as an indicator, the subtlety of the psychological realism of the characters portrayed, and their corresponding sympathy, switches polarity at the street level (unlike Caiphas, most ordinary Jews at street level are remarkably round, in E. M. Forster's sense, as compared to the rank and file Romans who, unlike Pilate, are somewhat cartoonish). Such an effect is not possible, of course, if the director or text is anti-Semetic. Before using such terms regarding film, one ought to know the real thing by having viewed a couple educational films from Nazi Germany about the science of eugenics. In any event, true racism is objectively presented in the movie -- of certain Romans against Jews.Beyond the authentic/realistic context, our hypothetical viewer without a particular credal axe to grind, knowing nothing of the new testament (like a man from Mars) would most likely just legitimately wonder -- why are they doing this to this man? The film's explanation (based on Matthew) is Jesus' apparent claim to be part of a deity, by a certain formula of words. Focusing on the passion, the film does not fully explain this -- the man from Mars would basically come away with an impression of some sort of great taboo that was broken, causing frenzy and confusion among the Jewish authorities. But again, malice would not be the conclusion. Indeed Caiphas is portrayed as not wanting to kill Christ before the taboo words are spoken. An objective atheist or our man from Mars could not then come away holding that any sort of assumed racial defect or malignancy was the cause. If anything, it is the sheer power of the taboo that is the cause. A true atheist or confident rationalist would not fear this critical focus of the movie, then, since he would reject the taboo ipso facto as a religious belief system. Indeed he might well yet be interested in the film, very interested in it indeed, as a modern attempt to authentically portray the consequences of breaking a powerful taboo in the ancient world.The fact is, I have heard no criticism based on the fact that the movie justifies the breaking of the taboo against saying I am. Yet a truly principled attack on the movie would not only have to start there, but grapple with that centrally, and then say something in favor of continuing that taboo in conclusion, ie, censorship of texts or artworks that include that verbal formula. Of course, none of us have heard such a thing.Regarding the use of Anne Catherine Emmerich, the Marian and/or stations of the cross images, etc.: this is nothing more than Gibson's signature, the 20% quotient of interpretivism. It is mainly visual, and neither adds nor subtracts any major element not in the source, Matthew. It is a question of emphasis. And it serves to give artistic unity to the whole. Yes, it does also admit that Gibson is a believer -- such an unambiguous admission to the audience actually being an honest, and therefore praiseworthy virtue, even from the perspective of an ethical pagan. Only certain modern pagans, cut loose from Aristotle, Homer, and the roots of Western culture, advocate the creation of subversive artwork that fools or tricks its audience into beliefs or attitudes cleverly disquised or contra-indicated. While a prime tool of Marxists, such tactics were considered unworthy in the ancient world and indeed there are no known texts from that world which employ such a strategy.Actually, the real subject of this movie is conversion. Gibson conveys Christ's gaze as the operative machine of this process, with some analogy to the fine use of Christ's shadow by director Nicholas Ray in King of Kings (1961). Comparing and contrasting to this and other filmic precedents would be more interesting than much of what we have been hearing, not only from foes but also from some purported friends of Passion.I have been trying to write this in a manner to avoid taking a lot away from a fresh first viewing, which I certainly urge. But I cannot help adding one last comparison -- of the Simon scene to John Paul II's poem, Portait of a Cyrenean a/k/a Simon of Cyrene. One cannot claim that Gibson read the late pope's poem, but the visual parallels are remarkable.Actually, your best prep for this movie might be to rent out a good silent movie, like Abel Gance's Napoleon or anything featuring Chaplin. The subject appears to have pushed Gibson back to the roots of cinema: gestures and faces. Thankfully not everything is subtitled.My overall conclusion: 3.85 stars out of 5. I don't hold with those that think this is the greatest movie ever made. The Christian Word -- which includes the dogma of a personal Savior and all the eccentricity that may go with it --is inherently incapable of a 5 star movie, or a 5 star artwork of any kind. The closest post-Biblical Christian literature came to 5 stars was Dante, who admitted his failure in his Divine Comedy's last line, and that was a supreme admission from a very proud man and ought to set us all to fear and trembling. Rembrandt for the most part gave us a lot of 3.75 star Jesus paintings, and to borrow from Hemingway, he probably had the best shot at the title. Well, there is a fine Rembrandt etching of the Crucifixion that clocks in at about 4.1. As for the movies, every sincere effort gives you a facet of the Christ -- Jeff Hunter in King of Kings, teamed up with Nicholas Ray behind camera, was heading for a 4.3 maybe, but as we say in Indy town, he kissed the wall. See it again anyway and ignore a lot of the script (based on the top scholarship of its day, by the way).Saint Bernard, a.d. 1200, saw the West taking a questionable turn before the Renaissance, as far as religious art is concerned: a return to sheer classic realism is a gain, of course, but also a loss because the room for the personal vision is thereby limited. If you have seen Michelangelo's Pieta you cannot imagine that scene ever another way. I thus don't grant any Michelangelo, DaVinci, Raphael, Bernini etc more than a 3.7 when it comes to Jesus Christ. Mel gains not because he's more talented than those guys, but because those guys are his school and he builds on them. Many justifiably still prefer icons in this particular competition.John the Apostle even threw in the towel on this one, you know: He said many other things but not all the books in the world .... & etcetera. So as our famous dean of American realism might have put it, Don't get into the ring with John the Apostle.Of course, Mel did get into the ring, didn't he? Of his hubris there is no doubt -- its just not very apparent in this movie, though, scene by scene -- or at least on the surface. As for even undertaking the project -- sure, that's some hubris, all right. But Gibson's stepping into this ring only proves that in the realm of art, certain rules can be broken if counter-balancing compensations are made. Here, as in much of the best art of this country, the bow was to the aesthetic of realism with both feet. The movie has much more in common with Clint Eastwood's unflinching look at the old west in The Unforgiven than with any filmed version of any didactic tract or religious text. If you want your didacticism plain, go see a Star Trek movie and may be the wind be at your back.As for this film, there's enough going on in it -- including much not mentioned here -- that you should avoid as much of the debate as possible, even or especially from Mel's friends, and just go see it with an open mind as to what will hit you from a talented believer shrewdly aware of both his own limitations and those of film generally.",4,Trying to Look at the Passion Dispassionately,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",0.1644

On a visual level, Gibson successfully incorporates graphic violence with flashbacks to give the viewer a convincing view of how Jesus may lived and how he suffered. In terms of substance, the acting was superb - James Caviezel was the perfect person to play Jesus. There was something about him -- I thought his presence gave the film the intensity that it had. However, other figures such as Mary Magdalene to the Roman soldiers were excellent. It is clear that a great deal of emotion and feeling went into the actors performances - you can feel Mary's pain when she is crying for her son and her desperate need to console him and you can almost feel that Judas' betrayal is eating away at him. Furthermore, another positive point was the language enriched the film and made it more authentic. Regardless of what religion you are part of, if you are an agnostic or an atheist, this film is highly recommended because it is an intense study of human flaws such as betrayal and condemnation.People will have differing views on this film because religion is such a controversial topic but don't let yourself be discouraged by negative reviews - you have to see it to make up your own mind.",5,Overwhelming,1081555200,"04 10, 2004",-0.1202

It seems unfair to judge any film for what it is not, instead of what it is&#65533;namely, a physically graphic, agonizingly detailed reenactment of His final hours. Considering how profound and far-reaching is the message of Jesus, and how impenetrable is the mystery of His existence, I think Mr. Gibson makes a fine artistic choice in limiting his themes and thereby enabling (forcing?) us to appreciate the magnitude of His sacrifice.

I have read the new testament and never knew that Jesus first had the idea for the modern table. I have two bad knees, so this really raised my opinion of Jesus.

Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel Sadist Gibson, I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe, but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim. In short, it's just a movie, not a particularly good one, with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what's happening or to make you care. It looks terrific---Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness. But that's about where the praise ends. The whole thing has a nasty tone; in Mel's version of the tale, anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery, and while I'm not a believer myself, my guess is that's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it. And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end, eyes a-blazin' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack, I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to Braveheart Part II. Mel Gibson is a wretched director, and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously, for that gives them clout they don't deserve. All he's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie, complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire Friday the 13th series. This stuff was camp 30 years ago, and it's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie's complete lack of narrative grounding. See this or don't see this, whichever is your preference. But religious or not, this film is not going to change your life.

It's something you probably won't watch often but something you'll never forget once you do. This is an incedibly brutal yet poetic film about twelve horrific hours that changed the world forever.James Caviezel is absolutely perfect in his characterization of the tortured and rejected Messiah slowly but surely moving closer and closer to his preordained death and final fulfillment of his earthly mission. Monica Bellucci also shines in her understated performance as Jesus' adoring Mary Magdelene, her face mirroring the pain and suffering of her beloved teacher with each stroke of the wip on his pulverized body.There's a surreal, dreamlike feel to the sequences in which Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) appears. Having the Great Adversary played be a woman provides an androgenous quality to the persona of evil that works well. Watching Satan glide through the crowded streets of Jerusalem accompanied by a small entourage of infant-like demons gleefully observing the ongoing torture and humiliation endured by Jesus in his last hours is quite Bergmannesque.Believer - Deist - Agnostic - Atheist?

Its dialogue is all in original tongue (Aramaic and Latin) giving the film a wonderful ancient perspective never before experienced. It's a movie that has an amazing amount of power.Here's what's not so good, it appeals solely to Christians. There is no doubt in Mel Gibson's mind that Jesus is the Son of God. From the appearance of Satan though out the film to the earthquake after Jesus dies, Gibson reminds us that it is not a man we see but God in the flesh of man. As a result of this, it is not surprising that many Jews are offended by this movie. They are portrayed in not the kindness light. Which brings us to our next point, is it a movie about history or faith.In the end, this is a movie about faith. Sadly, it would be a better movie if others, than just Christians, could access that faith. I don't think this movie tries to divide people or faiths, but any movie solely about a particular kind of faith is going to alienate others. I also know of many children who have seen this movie and I cannot recommend it for them. This is a graphic and violent film that promotes adult discussion about faith. It is not for kids. Finally, since this was such a controversial film, I am surprised by the absence of DVD extras, not even commentary. I think in this movies case, the extras could have been added respectfully in providing a little more clarity to a film that has had such an impact.(3 and a half stars)",3,3 and a Half Stars,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",0.2149
121,A26PAN8REXYBYH,310263662,Brian M. Ranzoni Da Killa B,"[4, 11]","I caught Mel Gibson's *The Passion of the Christ* at the Albany Cinema. The latest film about Jesus Christ, messiah of the Christian faiths, Gibson's *The Passion* particularly plays on Christ's torture and crucifixion, beginning 12 hours before Christ's crucifixion. Throughout, Gibson expresses his own passion, while portraying images of abuse, demons, and Jews so over-the-top it sets an altitude record.Down-to-earth, *The Passion* impresses me. It plays as if the makers understood they dealt with a time-honored tale, but wanted to avoid a rehash. Likewise, it plays to impress today's comfortable Americans with the magnitude of Christ's suffering as imagined by Gibson. Finally, I get the impression Gibson drew parallels to his own self-destructive behavior and feelings.As such, *The Passion* draws not entirely unexpectedly from horror films. Gibson sets the audience up with enough jump scenes to rival *Freddy versus Jason*; darkened doors fly open and women jump. Gibson shows people suddenly punched, or snakes abruptly stomped on, or pieces of property slammed about, usually in dark hallways and corners. CGI demons abound in these places; in one case, literally coming out of the stonework. Children sprout reptilian teeth and cloudy eyes as they torment a guilt-ridden Judas. Creepy crawlies crawl out of Satan. In the last scene for Judas, Gibson focuses most on the leering corpse of a decaying donkey. Necro-fans will love this film.So will sadists and masochists. As soon as Jesus surrenders, about fifteen minutes into the film, he is severely beaten, choked cursed, and spat upon. After spending the night in chains, Christ is beaten all the way to the local Roman governor, beaten to King Herod's, beaten back to Pontius Pilate, and thrust upon Roman soldiers who are ordered to chastise Christ. These soldiers obey their liege's orders in a lengthy, graphic torture sequence. Christ carries his cross even though he can hardly walk; Gibson repeatedly shows Jesus collapsing and being beaten as he lay. With another graphic depiction, Gibson takes us on a guided tour of crucifixion.Gibson also managed to pull some interesting rabbits out of his hat with this film. Satan is portrayed as a pale, sexless anti-muse, softly persuading Christ to deny God. Its minions are equally androgynous imps: children with wrinkled leers and deep crow's feet. A brief shot of Hell shows a barren, ridged wasteland, littered with blackened skeletons of unidentifiable creatures.Yes, the demonic imagery made quite an impression on me in this film. I found it more disturbing and memorable than the bloodshed and the suffering of Christ. This is an unfortunate distraction from Gibson's story, but that's what happens when a Hollywood darling and action megastar makes a supernatural movie.Gibson's portrayal of Jews is a more complicated distraction. *The Passion* itself may not be anti-Semitic, but whether by accident, unconsciousness, or design, *The Passion* clearly portrays Jews as the earthly masterminds of Christ's fate.Jewish priests arrest Jesus and condemn him to death. Backed by a raging mob of Jewish citizens, the priests threaten rebellion if Governor Pontius Pilot fails to kill Jesus. Pilot authorizes Jesus' torture to placate the mob.Although sneering Roman soldiers inflict the most heinous tortures seen, Gibson repeatedly takes the camera back to the Jews looking over their shoulders, Satan wandering among the priests. The Roman torturers and guards periodically look over their shoulders in fear of the mob. Unsatisfied, the bloodthirsty Jews threaten to smear Pilot's name as an enemy of Caesar.By now Gibson portrays the crowd as so threatening that Roman guards must beat them back. Pilot, his wife, and his commanding officer are visibly disturbed by the very idea of killing Jesus. All of them speak lines indicating their good faith.-particularly Pilot, who is seen as possibly recognizing Christ's divinity. But the fear that Caesar will have their heads if the Jews rebel inspires them to cave in, and Gibson shows us an endless parade of frothing, jeering Jewish peasants hounding Jesus to his doom.*The Passion* left no question in my mind that the Romans are unwilling victims of Jewish force. It unmistakably emphasized Jewish pressure for Christ's demise. Critics who deny these elements must have seen a different cut of the film.Overall, I walked away inspired more by Gibson's passion than that of Christ. I like his choice to use period language, and I mock people who think he should have filmed in English. I also respect his vision; even if it struck me as a masochistic drama replete with distracting iconography and horror-movie elements, it also struck me with the power of Gibson's convictions. Gibson drives his convictions home with a desaturated, over-exposed cinematography reminiscent of *Saving Private Ryan*.It is a shame, then, that *The Passion of the Christ* is only okay. It distracted me with the scale of the blood and gore and the prominence of the demonic imagery. And whether intended or not, Gibson plainly tips the balance of blame towards Jewish people. Still, it is a powerful story, cutting to a center of the Christian faith. I don't blame people who deny any distractions or anti-Semitic impressions, except to say they need to see the movie again and pay closer attention. Gibson did not make me believe Christ was a real person, let alone one that died for my sins. He sure made me believe his own sincerity, though, and I commend Gibson's passion; it inspires me to express my own views in public forums.",3,The Passion of the Gibson,1091318400,"08 1, 2004",-0.1954
122,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,310263662,Britt Gillette thedvdreport.blogspot.com,"[13, 15]","The most controversial film of 2004, Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ was widely derided by critics and detractors as a two-hour anti-Semitic pornography/horror flick, complete with splattering blood and arduous torture. But among the Christian community (of which I consider myself a part) and open-minded people who actually saw the film, The Passion stands alone as the most eloquent expression of God's love for mankind ever to grace the big screen.The Passion certainly is violent, but not anymore violent than similarly rated films of the past ten years. But despite contentions by some evangelical Christians that everyone should see this film, I don't think young children should see it. This movie is for mature audiences only, and I think anyone under the age of sixteen should have a full understanding of the previous events underlying the main focus of the film before viewing it.The entire movie was filmed in the original Aramaic with English subtitles. This enhances, rather than detracts from, the film's enjoyment because it creates an emotional aura of mystery and sacredness to the subject. Since most people are at least vaguely familiar with the storyline, you won't find yourself distracted by reading subtitles as one might think. With just the opposite effect, you find yourself paying greater attention to the visual images displayed on the screen, and the power of the events unfolding before you is amplified several times over.The Passion of the Christ combines the four written accounts found in the New Testament Gospels to create a vivid and powerful portrayal of the arrest and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.The film opens in the Garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus of Nazareth (James Caviezel) is engaged in prayer, asking his Father to deliver him through the events soon to come. A satanic figure lurks in the shadows, dispensing a series of temptations and doubts. No one man can bear the sin of the world. It's impossible. It's too much, the figure says. When Jesus refuses to give into Satan's temptations, his disciple Judas arrives to betray him to the Temple Guard...Gibson's cinematic genius is apparent by his measured and precise use of flashbacks which draws the audience away from the violence in brief intervals so as not to cause an emotional overload. Flashbacks include Jesus teaching to a crowd about his power to lay down my life, and take it back up again, Jesus washing the feet his disciples at the last supper, and Jesus as a playful personality interacting with Mary. One particularly powerful scene traces back to Jesus as a toddler. When he falls down and injures himself, a panicked Mary runs to his rescue. This flashback correlates with the film's portrayal of Jesus stumbling under the weight of the cross.Overall, this ranks as one of the greatest films ever made. If you believe Jesus of Nazareth was the Biblical Messiah (which this film reviewer does), then The Passion illustrates the enormity of God's sacrifice. But even if you think Jesus was just a mere mortal, this film serves a valuable purpose in that it underscores the barbarity of a human race that, more often than not, persecutes the innocent. Mel Gibson's greatest production to date is a film every student of history, philosophy, and human nature owe it to themselves to see...The DVD Report",5,Emotionally powerful...,1113955200,"04 20, 2005",0.2107

I noticed they reduced the amount of gore and injuries on the body of Jesus. It would have been much worse than what they showed.

124,ALC3LG8YTNHU3,310263662,Bruce Barker Risingsnow,"[11, 24]","A few observations (without spoilers)I finally saw this movie when it was released on home video. I went twice to watch it in theaters and was appalled by the audience awaiting admittance. The first time, I was walking from the parking lot to the box office when a small bus pulled up and a church Sunday school group that included roughly a dozen small children (ages 5 to maybe 8 roughly)hopped out with chaperones. I got in line behind them and listened to the adults talking about the number of times they had each seen the film and how much they were looking forward to discussing it with the children afterwards. Having been previously advised from numerous places of the realism of the torture sequences and crucifixion, I decided the greater horror for me would be in seeing these small children react to the supposedly graphic violence. I simply walked back to my car and went home. The second time (a few weeks later after the initial rush of people going to a new movie had died down a bit)I actually managed to purchase a ticket and was waiting in the lobby for the previous screening to let out. A few minutes later, the doors opened and the crowd began shuffling out. Once again there were several families with small children. While the parents attempted to masquerade their emotional reactions by blinking and talking about how the sudden bright sunlight was tearing them up, the children weren't old enough to be embarrassed about showing feelings in public. Most were openly sobbing, all had red eyes, and one small girl (perhaps 4 or 5 years old at most) was shaking so badly that her dad had to pick her up, console her, and carry her outside. Once again, I was so upset and angry I had to leave.Now that I've seen it with my own eyes I can see why those kids were so freaked out.Although I don't belong to one of the most commonly known denominations, I am a Christian. I am also a daily reader of the scriptures, and have lectured on biblical scripture and prophecy all over the Eastern U.S. in churches and seminaries, as well as on college campuses. In other words, while I wouldn't define myself as an expert on all things God, I'm a bit more spiritually seasoned than most laypeople.The life of Jesus Christ, as depicted in the Bible, is centered around the final 3 years of his earthly life. His birth is depicted - especially in regards to the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and Jewish traditions - and there is a brief mention of his youth in the book of Luke. There are literally dozens of events during the 3 years of Christ's earthly mission that are filmworthy. In fact, the sheer number of films made about his life stand as proof of that fact. Did the world truly need a story that not only focuses primarily on Jesus' final week, but uses every means of modern effects to splatter gore and depict the massive agony endured by the Son of God? Maybe I'm in the minority (apparently, I should say) but I don't need to watch Jesus writhe and scream with each strike of the lash in order to respect and understand the sacrifice such suffering represented. I didn't need to personally witness the nails being driven in, the biblical depiction sufficed. The Glory of Christ's sacrifice is not found in his willingness to endure pain and death in God's name. Literally hundreds of millions of ordinary people have done that before Christ's birth as well as after. The Glory of Christ is found in the Word of God that came from his lips and the power of the Holy Spirit that transformed the entirety of humankind.We are asked to live the message and believe in Christ's name. We are not required to bear witness to the atrocities committed to his human vessel.But most important of all, I deeply believe that forcing or allowing small children to endure the trauma of watching the torture and murder of someone they have been taught to love above all others is not only unnecessary, but borders on abuse. Learning of the Passion from the Bible or from suitable talks with parents, clergy, and Sunday school teachers should be enough education for a small child to understand that God loves them and that Jesus can live within their hearts.Mel Gibson may have had the best intentions (my right to judge ends at the tip of my own nose) but I am of the opinion that the end result represents a massive and grotesque misjudgement.Feel free to slam this review if that is your wont.

There, it even says that the Commentaries are only available on the full length version, not the Recut. This is too bad that this DEFINITIVE VERSION is so poorly described on its own back cover. I am sure that it has diminished sales of this superior DEFINITIVE VERSION, since you can't tell that the original version is on the DVD until you actually get it home and watch it yourself! I had it at home for a week before I found out that both version were included!The widescreen is best for THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, of course, since some scene compositions are often too large to see everything going on, if you are watching a FULL Screen DVD.

The DEFINITIVE VERSION only comes in Widescreen.This DEFINITIVE VERSION is years overdue, in my opinion, but at least it is finally available!

This is all good, and what you would expect to see. There is a lot of insightful information concerning the filming of this classic masterpiece film! Then there is another half hour, or so, of theological video documentary material, not specific to THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST film, but about the Gospel sections that are shown in Mel Gibson' movie.The Commentaries are very good, as well! Mel Gibson appears on two different Commentaries. The first one is dominated by Mel, with two other folks who made the film with him, and there is another Commentary with Mel concerning theological concepts. Mel takes a back seat on this one, but he can still be heard every once in a while, but it is still a very interesting Commentary, though it may be heavier on Catholic concepts than even the actual film seems to be. It is still very interesting.I learned a lot from all of these Bonus Features! For instance, they shot most of the film using different frames per second, to make motions look more graceful. Also, there's talk about things like Satan's old baby, finally explained by Mel! This shows how evil mimics good things, but when you look closer, the perversion is revealed. There is also a short video shot of Mel trying to coach Satan into licking the old baby's face, which Satan reluctantly does, though it did not make the final cut.This DEFINITIVE VERSION is a MUST HAVE for any fans of THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST film! It is too bad that it is confusingly labeled, and years later than it should have been released, but you will likely forgive all that after you have gone through all the new Bonus Features and Commentaries, and you will have understood the intents of Mel Gibson and his collaborators much better, and maybe even pick up a few theological things that you might not have thought of before!",5,Contains BOTH the ORIGINAL and RECUT Versions!

This is no mystery or suprise; be it sports, fashion, cars, vacation spots, etc., people desire connection to larger things mostly out of dissapointment from their own failures, losses, and frustrations. Gibson did not just pander to the religious-right bible thumping deep south fanatics, but what he really was after was placing blame square on someone's shoulders: seeing that Morgenstern's father had to beg Mel to cut out the blood be on your children part, it's pretty straightforward as to where he comes from and who he wishes to demonize. Furthermore, Gibson is staunchly Roman Catholic, demanding that people follow him and keep prayers in the Latin tongue...umm, alright Mel, frankly that whole side to you is lame and passe; it's like saying to someone Hey, do these prayers my way or the highway! Mel really looked to place blame and rekindle old doubts and frictions between the Vatican and the Middle East; perhaps he had is way in that respect. Main Point: Mel loves his Vatican and old religious practices and tried to turn the good Christians in America toward the side of the Vatican. Result: very bad move.Problem 2: Religion or Race? What is really more important and deeply engrained in the minds of most peoples? Do you cast greater prejudice on grounds of physical features or religious affiliations?: Answer, race motivates on a deeper, actually realistic level as compared to phony religious claimings. All of the worlds struggles, great conflicts, boil down to nationalistic pride and xenophobia more so than religious differences; e.g. the Persians allowing Jerusalem to be a site of worship for all peaceful peoples. The real cancer on the Earth today is still the Vatican, which is itself pagan and by no means perfect (crusades, persecutions, papal bullying of nations including England and Germany by Romes legions, grand inquisition, etc.). Will there ever be an African Pope? Ha, not bloody likely. Let's be real people, the world is determined and judged not by titles or teams (though commendment and numbers do help a cause) but by physical looks and similarities to our own ideals and preferences. Main Point: Cut the nonsense, this world of ours is a cyclic sphere of national aspirations and individual coruption when faced with far-reaching decisions. Result: we judge not by content of character or work ethic but by ideals.Problem 3: Religious difference as excuse for Racial decimation. The Vatican, Mel's favorite big brother, that old institution in Rome once hellbent on ruling the world (how dare these thugs in robes who do little work...Karol Wojytola or John Paul II as an exception...and do absolutely nothing for science or human alleviation but would rather tell women how to live and enjoy old religious ceremonies tell whole nations and unique peoples such as Russia and China how to live) has been shown in the last few years (child molestation and financial fraudulence) to be highly corrupt and hypocritical. How can Rome try to invade England and ruin Germany and deploy Spanish troops to Ireland hundreds of years ago, leaving death and destruction in their wake (Mel should have thought harder when making Braveheart, but being chauvanistic as he is, he forgot how the Scottish painted their faces blue and fought off Catholic Roman and Spanish troops trying to invande and take over the British Isles, not fight the English who have been a model nation to the world in regards to civilty and scientific thought...Newton ring a bell anyone?). Main Point: for a nonspiritual demagoguery such as the Vatican to escape unscathed for what they've done to so many nations who were gentle and intellgent and progressive all until Catholic dogma invaded, they've really dodged quite a few bullets. However, their time is running out. Result: a world growing increasingly tired of relgious teachings as their ever evolving senses tell them of its use as a pretext for conquests and plundering.Problem 4: As the brilliant Harvard professor Samuel Huntington has portrayed in his books on clashes of cultures and remaking world order, the world is by no means stable. Not even after civil wars, revolutions, world wars, coups....none have secured the longlasting peace so hoped for by many, but not all (e.g. thugs, gangs, criminals, dictators - the less intelligent real-life monsters of past and present). The world of tommrrow is not one of religion (even south america is growing apart thanks to hugo chavez's finger pointing at america) but one of national identity...ironically, that has always been the case. Main Point: integration and segregation continue to pull at eachother, fracturing America more than ever before. The unrealistic thoughts of everyone liking each other and just getting along are over, and have never been much more than false words for false security. Result: An America and Western world that wakes up to the threats from the east, a new China that could be peaceful partner or worst nightmare, and countries forced to take extreme measures due to unwanted influences (i.e. muslims taking over London's streets, France becoming a barnyard bash that doesn't work, and China wanting to remain a cultural empire unhinged by capitalism. The world will survive and grow as old ideas of how to do just such collapse across the globe. Dogma fails while reason, service, and a new humanity to all neighbors, be they of any race, flourishes. The Herculean Man-God ideal fades as people grow tired of God being white, black, asian, green, blue, etc. The world matures, people relax spiritually, and scientific advance continues to do some good, some bad.

It has become a symbol of adoring love for so many (and judging from the spitefully pornographic scribblings of a few reviewers also one of intense hatred).All of us who were raised in Christian households, who went to Catholic schools have heard and read the words: scourging and crucifixion. We've seen re-enactments of these evils in Passion plays, we also watched them acted out in previous movies on the Life of Jesus. But it took Mel Gibson and a fantastic actor like Jim Caviezel to graphically display the horror of what these truly were. Some people call this movie disgusting, some call it a gorefest. Well, that is what Gibson intended to film. Scourging went beyond punishment, it is the rendering of the victim into a symbol of broken and torn submission. Crucifixion displays the victim as a symbol for all our various fears of death and pain. A man crucified was a man who was bound, broken, bleeding, slowly suffocated and totally helpless to the fangs and beaks, claws and talons of every nearby carrion eater. Gibson forces us (the spoiled and the complacent) to witness this.

I Thought it was a wonderfully done. It was a awesome depiction of the sacrifice Jesus made for the us. Because he loved us so much, he didn't want to see us all perish, but wants us all to be with him and the father in heaven. But we are sinful by nature and there is penaty for sin, but the only penalty is death. we would have had to all perish because the debt that is owed is far too great. So Jesus came to earth as a man to make a bridge for us to the father God, and also had to die for everyone so we would have an oppertunity to be with the father. Jesus didn't want to die...I think he was actually scared and asked the father if there was another way. It's an extraordinary story whether you believe it or not.I've heard a lot of people argu that he was beaten too much in the movie and there was too much blood, I actually kind of agree; however, I'm sure it was a gruesome death and it probably hurt pretty bad.My biggest argument with the movie is the few things that mel gibson threw in that were kind of goofy. ex. The CG demon, the crow on the cross, satan with the baby, and the monster children.I think mel gibson is off his rocker and is pretty much crazy.

That doesn't lessen the impact of the film for me.The experience of this film was a very personal one for me as the viewer.

Its oft criticized bloody torturousness is the primary reason it is so effective in demonstrating how Jesus's love and forgiveness survives such astounding horrendousnous.As a docudramatic undertaking, the film is simply the embodiment of Gibson's Christian beliefs as expressed through traditional Catholic imagery. As with all movies based on actual events, the story is fleshed out with typical human actions and reactions. It must be stressed, however, that Gibson does not depict known personages in non-historical ways. If Pilate, for instance, is shown as equivocating, then that is the way he actually was, according to the Gospels. And as for bad representations of Jews? Jesus was a Jewish man in a Jewish nation with Jewish followers. Some of his countrymen loved him, some hated him, and some were ambivalent. Gibson very clearly shows this, as anyone can see who pays attention to the action. As well, some of the Romans are sadistic brutes, and some are decent people reluctantly carrying out duties.

B Collins Jr.,"[2, 4]","I decided to give this film 3 stars, exactly in the middle of the rating system, because there were scenes of great beauty and insight and then there were scenes of torture that were excessive and made me question the motives of the film makers.After reading many of the reviews of this film, I am reflecting on the conception of the atonement in Christianity and whether this film supported or undermined that basic theme that undergirds Christian belief.The atonement is a process whereby a perfect sacrifice is made to God the Father for the sins of mankind. Since there is no perfection except in God, then God himself must be sacrificed, and this is done through the death of his beloved Son, Jesus Christ, who is one with the Father and the Holy Ghost. Thus mankind's sins would remain upon us unless this perfect atonement is made, offering the possibility of life everlasting in heaven with God.So the question arises, is all this torture necessary for the atonement to occur? Must Christ have experienced this incredible gory and terrible torture to take the sins of the whole world upon him? As the sacrificial lamb, must he endure considerable pain and loss of blood, to take the sins of the world on his shoulders? I think not. It is the death of the innocent lamb that is the sacrifice and atonement for the sins of the whole world, not the endurance of the considerable bloody torture that leads to the atonement. It is the giving of his life, a pure, perfect, sacrifice that is the atonement for all of mankind's sins.So this leads to the question of why so much blood and gore? Was Gibson trying to say that mankind is so terrible that we do not deserve the sacrifice and atonement? Well there is no question there for surely we know mankind not to be deserving of complete and perfect grace upon our own merits, either as a species or individually. Was there some commentary about the religious and political establishment being made by the torture scenes? Well, it was organized religion and organized political oppression that together brought about the torture and death, to be sure, but is Gibson trying to say that organized religion in partnership with an oppressive central government is capable of great cruelty to the innocent, even unto God in a human state of existence? I never got the impression that the meaning of the film and sequence of scenes was really strategically thought through and thus in some ways this is only a terribly vicious, painful, gory snuff film with little reflection on the meaning of the sacrifice and atonement which are central concepts in Christianity and far more important than the nasty beating scenes where the flesh is literally pulled off the back and ribs of Christ.Does a sensationalistic portrayal of the passion of Christ do a service or disservice to Christianity? It really does neither for the movement of the Christ goes far beyond our ability to conceptualize the vast mystery of why atonement is necessary and why God himself, in the human form of Jesus, must make that sacrifice.

The plight of Judas Iscariot is no less powerful than that of his Master becoming the victim of circumstances that he could not forsee in his greed and power hungry heart.The fleshed out depictions of the spiritual forces of evil add a wickedness to the story that draws a clear disinction between Christ and the great Accuser, Satan, who is played by a woman to give the ancient rival of God a clearly feminine cast. Not sure why Gibson felt that was necessary, but it is visually stunning.The beating of Christ, however, is the most gruesome feature of this film.

It seems the choice of language is two-fold: one to appropriately depict the language of the times and also, I believe to keep us slightly distant from such a painful display - as though we had some way to look back at it all. Gibson was extremely brave because the scourging and crucifixtion are extremely painful to experience and could have sent people away in droves. However, I think Gibson tries to focus on the purpose of His suffering. Satan (wonderfully protrayed as a mocking amorphous being) confronts Christ in the garden and tells him that NO ONE MAN can take on the sins of the world - and that's why such a display of violence: each lash, each drop of blood, each thorn, each nail, is sin upon sin visited upon Him so that Man would not suffer separation from God.

On a moonlit night the clouds part and bathe a figure crying out in a garden, his soul wracked with torment, in white light. The man is the Messiah, Jesus, who only days before was welcomed into Jerusalem as a holy man and king. His disciples are asleep nearby, despite his pleadings for them to stay awake and pray with him. From the shadows a figure observes, mesmerizing but evil to the very marrow of his soul. The shadow is Satan and deception and selfishness are his tools as he urges the Christ to give up this road, to let mankind atone for their own sins. But Jesus refuses to submit to the seductive lies of the deceiver and symbolically crushes Satan's pet serpent under his heel.In the Jewish Temple Judas stands before the High Priests. He has been promised thirty pieces of silver for betraying the Christ. The coins scatter around him on the floor and he hastily bends to pick them up. Torches illuminate the night as he leads them to the Gardens to arrest the Messiah. The disciples resist but Jesus comes willingly into the Temple Court. At the moment of his arrest Mary, his mother, awakens in torment, certain something terrible is happening. John has managed to escape and comes to fetch her and Mary Magdalene. They are not allowed inside the counsel but there Jesus is questioned, slandered, spit on, and sent to the Romans in order to plead for his execution. Pontius Pilate's wife Claudia has awoken from a nightmare and begs him not to sentence the king of the Jews to death. But Jesus has been sent to earth to bear the burden of sin for mankind. The penalty is persecution, merciless beating, and eventual crucifixion.One of the most emotionally disturbing but profoundly touching films to come out in a long time, The Passion of the Christ has arisen great controversy, and for good reason. Between the themes and the brutality, there is a lot not to like... and a lot to appreciate both as a believer, and as a scholar of history. This film is visually stunning to the point of being overwhelming. Its subject matter is extremely dark but mesmerizing. The slow arch of the bag of coins as it flies through the air into Judas' outstretched hand... a close up of Mary Magdalene as Jesus cries It is finished... the tears on her face, the wind slowly caressing her hair... the captivating but disturbing image of Satan watching Jesus flogged nearly to death with great pleasure, holding a child-like demon in his arms. These characters are real. You empathize with the good and hate the bad. For an instant when he first appears you're mesmerized by Satan, wondering if the apparition is an angel... but then you realize the truth. The malice in its eyes, the cold deception of its words. Jesus is someone you instinctively love. You pity Him, feel each of the blows... flashbacks illuminate moments of His extraordinary life. The acting is so good you don't even think about the actors... it's too real. I loved the enhancement on James Caviezel's eyes... they are absolutely spellbinding, full of love throughout torment.Catholics will appreciate the symbolism rampant throughout, as well as nods to traditional Catholic teachings and the writing of Josephus. There are mild deviations from scripture and a few of the writers' additions are unexplained, but the film is one we should all see at least once.

There is artistic license, that is brought in from the longer tradition of the church. For those who know the stories from pilgrimage times, all of the pieces of following the trail of Christ are there. In some South American countries doing this reenactment is still very popular around Easter.For those of you who don't like subtitles, this movie might be confusing. I found it hard to follow some of the characters, since they aren't named very often. Also, a friend of mine who knows Latin didn't think that the subtitles translated all of the dialogue, but that might be a matter of interpretation, too. The character of Satan is quite a unique creation, not at all what one might expect in the biblical tale.In the end, this is a movie that whatever the viewers want to see in it, they will. If they want to see anti-Semitism, they can find it, but it isn't a hit-them-over-the-head kind. If they want to find a fictional recreation, they will.

It wasn't too spiritual an experience for me, but others in the theater seemed to get that feeling from it all.

Its method is to suffucate its recepient by nailing the person in a seated possition without any buttocks or back support, while hanging dependently with its nailed hands across, along with the feet nailed together, that the criminal crucified would thus be forced to pull its body upward through its nailed hands, while using the nailed feet to push upward in order for some air to come into it's lungs by lifting its body , so as to loosen the strangulation caused by the rib cage , when a person is set in such a possition . This movie THE PASSION Of The Christ, focused itself on the last days (or rather hours) of Christ in its intentional means to fully visualize the torture and great hardships that Christ went through in order to die for the sins of mankind as a means of retribution to save men's souls -- through loosely unbiblically based dramatization sequences with the help of amazing make up prosthetics and special effects, and with the means to emote a lot in its scenes for that matter - which could've saved itself of some - if they only stick with the facts to be authentic with the details, like if they studied enough and get the idea of how the crucifixion really works, it would've simply saved the producers all of the trouble by trying to be so gory dramatic in the number of sequences for this film. As it is that the main idea of director Mel Gibson and its production is to show the viewers how much Christ have suffered, and gain the viewers's conviction about it. However, the movie have in that aspect have studied the type of lashing methods which are being used in that time that Christ have recieved, peculiarly, even based on the enigmatically fraudulent TURIN SHROUD findings.Supported by the Jesuits, this Mel Gibson film heralds to share the sentiments of the Catholics with regards to Mary. However biblical it is with the emphasis concerning the Jews who have the part of pushing Christ into his death by crucifixion, which caused the protest within the Jewish community for the film as anti-semetic -- the movie's main purpose is to pull up the sentiments concerning the Saviour's sacrifice for mankind's sins and their retribution.Through flashbacks along with its storylines sequences, the movie is uncanny to the viewer in its presentation - that it is devoid of any detailed explanations for the scenes as if it have totally considered that all who would view the film are already familliar of the story of Jesus Christ. Let alone who would comprehend what are the things that are going on in the motion picture if one is totally unfamilliar to any of the accounts of Christ written in the Bible.However though, the film is a success as far as its tear-jerking factor is concerned as it have been effective in that aspect to the most of its audiences.Furthermore, if in any case an athiest would watch the film should he be convinced or moved about the saviour, when the movie seemed to only have its strongest appeal to those who are already symphathizers of the faith. u000bAnyhow, given that if it is indeed the idea that Christ's mission on earth is to open up an access for the salvation of mankind by dying on the cross and through sufferings-- then God is fond of using irony indeed.",2,To Nail or not to nail,1081641600,"04 11, 2004",0.1367

165,A4LLXH0IZ3LMQ,310263662,Christopher Forbes weirdears,"[23, 42]","I find myself approaching the review of this movie with mixed emotions. I know that whatever I say will be a magnet for negative votes. So I may as well just be honest about it. I found the movie by turns beautiful and infuriating. When I think back over it more of the infuriating stuff comes up, and yet I was moved a number of times during the film. sometimes the movie seems to be cheap and exploitive and sometimes it is pierced through with an obvious spiritualityFirst of all....the good things about the film. The visuals are actually quite beautiful, like a Carravaggio come to life. Gibson is obviously highly influenced by Counter-Reformation ideals of art (with both good and bad results I think) but as for visual beauty, you can't do much worse than that for inspiration.I found many of the small moments to be the most compelling. The healing of Malchus, the High Priest's servant was very moving, perhaps the one moment in the movie where you got an inking of why Jesus' death is supposed to be a greater tragedy than the suffering of countless other Jews in Palestine during that time. The Denial of Peter was also very moving, though this is the one story in Holy Week that is always guaranteed to reduce me to tears. I relate to Peter rather strongly. Some of the other flashbacks are equally powerful, if I think too short. Why we didn't get the entire scene of Jesus stopping the stoning of Mary Magdalene I'll never really know...it's one of the most beautiful passages in the Gospel of John.Okay...now the problems or questions. First of all, is the blame of Jesus' death placed on the Jews? Yes and no....it is certainly placed on the Jewish authorities. If you are to be at all faithful to the Gospels you can't get around doing this...so in that aspect the movie is as anti-Semitic as I believe the Gospel of Matthew and John are in parts. You can blame the movie, but the blame should go squarely at the source I think. To sweep this part under the rug, you have to cut out part of the Gospel.What concerns me more is the subtle anti-Jewish aspects of the film, Some of the aspects are so subtle that I don't think many people without a lot of background in Biblical history will catch them. For one thing, Gibson does not portray the Last Supper as a Seder. There is some disagreement in the Gospels on this point. Matthew, Mark and Luke place the Last Supper on the first night of Passover, while John places it on the last night before Passover. Gibson takes the last view, as he shows Jesus blessing and distributing pita bread rather than unleavened bread. This is a subtle point, but it reinforces the unconscious idea that Jesus wasn't really Jewish. And it's not the only example of this in the movie, just the most obvious.The worst scene to me is one that doesn't get much comment. Judas, in torment over his betrayal of Jesus is teased by a bunch of little children, looking like little Yeshiva boys in short pants and yarmulkes. (I'm not even sure that yarmulkes date back that far, but I need to research this. I do know that kids wouldn't have worn short pants!) The yeshiva boys then turn into demons. This attack of the killer yeshiva boys is perhaps one of the most evil things in the movie, being purely out of Mel's fantasy mind and having no bearing in scripture at all.Then there is the issue of the filmmaking itself. By focusing so exclusively on the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, Gibson leaves very little room for character development. If you come to this movie as a committed Christian, you probably will be moved, since you know the character of Jesus already. But for those without much familiarity with the story, the characters are hopelessly two-dimensional. We know that Peter, Mary, Mary Magdalene and others are moved and distraught over Jesus' execution, but we don't really know why from a motivational standpoint. Taking the last twelve hours of Jesus' life without at least a little insight into who Jesus was, robs the movie of context and robs the death of Jesus of it's context.Also, the focus of this movie is so unrelentingly on the death of Jesus as to be a theological distortion. Jesus' death is one of the central mysteries of the Christian faith, but only one of them, and perhaps not the most central. The Resurrection is what puts it all in perspective, and that's given very short shrift in this movie. This plus the extreme realism of the movie, actually defeats a Traditionalist viewpoint that Jesus was both Human and Divine.So, in conclusion, for me the movie was worth seeing. Even with all the caveats I mentioned, I did get something from the movie. It was akin to the kind of Ignatian meditation that I usually do on Good Friday. I think that if someone goes into the movie with a religious bent, you will come out with something. But if you aren't religious, this movie isn't going to convert you. You'll probably just feel lost and repelled.One final thought: the most disturbing thing about this movie to me didn't happen during the movie but happened at the end as the lights were coming up. Behind me an African-American man said to his date: Now I hate the Jews even more than I did before. They deserved what they got in the Holocaust. A chill went up and down my spine at that. to hear something like that come out of someone's mouth out loud scared me down to my bones.

As in many Religous themed films there's an abundence of overacting. I understand it needed to be violent, but it just goes over the top. I will say the art direction and cinematography are admirable, and while the story is thin there are certainly scenes with impact. Still the film tired with me fast.

167,A3CM1CDUSWYDIO,310263662,Christopher Schmitz,"[3, 5]","Up to this point, I considered 1993's Schindler's List the ultimate in cinematic emotional drain. But The Passion of the Christ stirs even more emotions, the most salient of which are anger, shock, and melancholy. By tapping into the primary art medium of our time, the darkest slice of Christ's biography, his torture and execution at the hands of Jewish clergy and Roman authority, has once again asserted itself as the most influential story ever told.Opening in a Gethsemane bathed in blue light, director Mel Gibson quickly introduces one of his innovations, an androgynous and Druidic Satan figure who will flit through the rest of the narrative, appearing even on the via dolorosa carrying some sort of mutant child.Overall, however, the film is faithful, perhaps even excessively faithful, to the canonical gospel accounts of Christ's last hours. It strives for realism enough to allow its characters to speak Latin and Aramaic, revealing Jesus' name as Yehosua, but it presents the miraculous as well: Christ restoring a man's sliced ear or the temple cracking in half as the moment of Christ's death. Most significantly, it presents the resurrection of Christ in a brief and artful scene in which he disappears from his tunic, which fluffs and falls, reconstituting himself as unblemished except for the holes of his stigmata.But Jesus is hardly unblemished through most of the film. Unless you've moved into the rathole vacated by Saddam Hussein, you're aware that this 2004 film offers the most graphic presentation of Jesus' suffering in any Christ film yet. His torturers are far more sadistic than in King of Kings or Jesus of Nazareth. The scene of Christ's scourging has quickly become a conversation piece as the movie rules the box office. Most of the Romans who administer the scourging are vicious thugs who seem to relish the destruction of a body. Choosing a whip whose hooks tear flesh from bone, they render Jesus a bloody pulp from head to toe, exposing spongy subdermal layers and even a few ribs. By the time the actual crucifixion occurs, we see an elbow bone poking through skin as well. The first nail is driven in with a geyser of blood.This is not, however, gratuitous violence. The suffering here is the point. It is a statement and a sacrifice in the mind of the one suffering and his two billion believers. Actually, Mel Gibson pulls his punches in a few places, since crucifixion involved asphyxiation and baking in the sun, neither of which isdepicted in The Passion.The acting and direction are solid, even excellent in The Passion the Christ, but the real star here is an ace cinematographer. Certain visuals are seared on your brain after seeing The Passion. These include the unctuous eyebrow-less devil with his mutant baby, the scenes of the two Marys taking linen and mopping what looks like gallons of Jesus' blood from around the scourging post, and the scene which finally brought tears: As she watches her son fall with his cross, Mary remembers him falling as a little boy. Maternal concern written all over her face, she runs to pick him up. But 30 years later as she approaches her son, she is unable to aid him, only watch the gruesome spectacle. His hair stringy, his face covered in blood and sweat, he assures her: See! I make everything new!Was anyone ever so misunderstood as Christ? So many in the film from Pilate to Caiaphas just don't comprehend that Christ doesn't seek power in the material world but would rather direct our eyes to a simmering mirage on a distant dune, the lifeforce around and within us, the everlasting spirit that will survive our bodies whose oxygen addiction will prove fatal in 80 years. Mutiple and brief flashbacks to the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper feature a robust charismatic Jesus, but perhaps these are too brief and too few as some have complained. They might have been increased and lengthened to create a more effective counterpoint to the story's endless gore.Still, even this complaint may arise from discomfort with massive human suffering. Doesn't a person with advanced HIV symptoms suffer like this? How about a person standing near a Palestinian suicide bomber or withering in a Serbian death camp?

That meant I couldn't respond to the guilt trip Mel Gibson meant to put on everyone about how Jesus suffered for everyone's sins, so I looked at it as just a movie. A very boring movie.First the good parts. I thought using the ancient languages worked very well as did the look of the film, which featured some good filter effects (the garden scenes) and a drab color palette that evoked the past more than a bright one would have. I also liked Maia Morgenstern's performance as Mary. She did an excellent job of portraying her mixed feelings of pride and pain. The sets of the city were good and there were some great landscape shots, especially from the mountains. I also thought the DTS soundtrack was very good.Those weren't enough to make this a good movie for me though. The beatings grew boring very quickly, which made the final half of the film very tedious for me. Mel Gibson mostly worked in caricatures, portraying the Roman soldiers as mindless brutes, the apostles as dim-witted cowards and the Jews as a rabid mob. James Caviezel did a good enough job playing an impossible role, but I didn't find someone covered in blood or woodenly quoting biblical passages particularly interesting. The scenes with the Satan character didn't work for me at all.There was also the problem that, if you weren't a Christian or familiar with the Christian mythology, this movie would have made no sense at all. I guess to Gibson this wasn't a problem, since he was making this film for a specific audience. That audience made him a lot of money, so I suppose the choices he took worked for his pocketbook. That does not make this a great movie though. (As far as the anti-Semitic question, I agree that this film qualified. The Jews suffered for centuries because of the Christ Killer label, and this movie echoed that belief. The Romans may have did the killing, but the Jews started the ball rolling, a fact Gibson hammered home repeatedly.

Regardless of how you may feel going into this film, you can not deny the excellent cinematography, amazing sets and realism this movie portrays. You would have to convince yourself to come out of this movie feeling hatred for the Jews. Nothing shown in the movie made me feel any animosity to anyone including the Jews. The movie pulls you in right away and you actually feel you are their watching Jesus being crucified and I have to admit I did shed a few tears. I could not help it, the movie is that convincing. All this media hype about being overly violent and containing hate towards anyone is flat out ridiculous, and since when does anyone in Hollywood show concern over a violent film especially when they glorify violence, calling it artistic freedom.

Others: too focused on one aspect. My teacher's sister saw the film and said that while it was good, there was way more to his life than just this. I'm writing this review as a spiritual person. I'm not Catholic, Buddhist, Muslim or Atheist. Or should I say I'm not solely one or the other. My spirituality is diverse with many branches. And people, it's okay to be catholic hater of this film or an atheist lover of it, but people seem to think you either are catholic and hate it or anything else and love. As for the anti-semitics? Please.The film chronicles the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life according to Mel Gibson so this film isn't a pseudo documentary where every event actually transpired(even if people doubt he actually existed). Anyway, the film starts with Christ being betrayed by Judas in the Garden of Gethsemane. Judas takes off and Christ is captured and others want him desperately to be punished. He's taken to Pontius Pilate, but he won't sentence him, King Herod won't either. But instead of risking a rebellion if Christ is freed, he orders his death by crucifixtion.While beautifully shot and some great performances even if you can't understand a word of Aramic or Hebrew, there is some problems. One: there's cases of extremes. The priests who want Christ are SO determined to get him sentenced. The Roman guards come off as extremely sadistic and almost seem to take pleasure with scourging Christ with poles and a vicious-looking cat o'nine tails(it looks like a claw). As for the violence, it is disturbing to a fault. There's a part where one of the claws is caught in Christ's side and is yanked, thereby pulling off some of his flesh. I don't know about you but does that seem necessary after such a brutal torture already? Or how about the 6, count em 6 times Christ falls when carrying his cross to the hilltop? Although one shot is can certainly be disheartening when Christ, nailed to the cross, has to be turned over but from the look of it, would hit the ground face first with the heavy cross crushing him although he's stopped. Quite an unnerving scene. The Resurrection scene should definately have been longer also.The movie does have its strong points though. For one, the score done by John Debney is one to listen to as it's epic and moving. The cinematography by Caleb Daschanel is very well done, the performances, especially by Jim Caviezel(Christ) and Maia Morgenstern(Mary) are quite impressive too.

The actors were OK I guess, but I think Mel's direction was overwrought or something. Mary and Mary and John didn't have much impact the way the film was structured.

If you love watching someone being tortured to death over a two hour period, then this film is for you.This film has nothing entertaining in it (I don't find torture entertaining) and provides nothing that makes us feel good or is uplifting or is of any benefit, except for maybe the some very few interesting costumes and some good visual effects, editing and camera work. This film does not teach any moral lesson or show any examples of doing good for others or how to better one's life or the lives of others. There are no spiritual lessons or examples or guides to spirituality. There is nothing that inspires any human to be a better human being.Mel gibson's use of eccentric and malformed persons laughing and heckling during one early scene somehow used to convey evil by their malformed appearance is particularly offensive to me as persons who in real life are malformed or suffer other natural disabilities are not intrinsically evil and such malformations are not caused out of some evil act.

He proved with Braveheart that he's adept at directing movies about rebellious, inspirational martyrs...and this time he graciously decided to let somebody ELSE play the starring role!Now, when this flick came out a couple of years ago, it was surrounded by controversy -- and not just because the title contains the word the more times than any movie except the Lord of the Rings: the Return of the King. For one thing, a lot of people thought the movie was anti-Semitic, because a lot of the bad guys were Jewish. Of course, a couple of the GOOD guys were Jewish, too -- not to mention the fact that many of the bad guys were Romans, not Jews. In truth, the movie is more anti-moron than anything. Just look at the portrayal of the d-bags who cackle and hoot while whipping Jesus with that freaky, scaled cat o' nine-tails; they were practically wearing dunce-caps.People also criticized the graphic violence in the movie. Frankly, I found the gore to be somewhat tamer than I was expecting, but I've sat through Troma flicks without blinking an eye. The scourging and crucifixion of Jesus is pretty brutal, but it's counter-balanced by Jim Angel Eyes Caviezel's excellent moaning. That makes you feel pretty bad for Jesus. Apparently, a bunch of people cried in the theater at these scenes, but I haven't shed tears at a movie since I saw the last five minutes of Jason X. I will admit: I did find myself exclaiming Jesus! at a couple of points, which is actually pretty appropriate.While all this scourging is going on, a sinister figure constantly lurks in the background. He looks sort of like the dude in Powder, and in one scene even carries around a little Mini-Me who snarls at the camera. The film never makes it perfectly clear that this is supposed to be Satan, but the guy's lack of eyebrows makes you pretty sure that it's SOME inhuman force of evil (other than Whoopi Goldberg).Now, forgive me if I spoil the end of the movie, but Jesus is resurrected, and the final shot is him triumphantly standing up to leave his tomb and go kick some serious @ss. Jesus even has holes in his hands from the crucifix, which will cut down wind-resistance when he pimp-slaps evil. It's pretty cool -- I'm hoping Gibson decides to make a sequel, like The Passion 2: Operation Stranglehold or something.In truth, the most impressive thing about the Passion of the Christ was the marketing.

183,A3VDGERHHLOQVQ,310263662,Crabby Apple Mick Lee,"[2, 3]","There are two different approaches within Christianity when it comes to Jesus of Nazareth. The first focuses on the teachings of Jesus-especially the love your neighbor part. The approach believes very much that Jesus came here and he had something to say. The approach has had a long and honorable history within the Church. Past a certain point it begins to break apart as far as exactly what it was Jesus had to say; but it is generally agreed that the message was of divine origin and reflected something about the mind of God. In this regard, The Passion Of The Christ comes up short in that it is devoid of clear spiritual teachings. Even the flashback to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount seems more than just a little subtle. Instead we have a gut wrenching account of Jesus' sufferings on the way to the cross that is frankly more than many can endure. Indeed, many members of the Jesus-Giver of Spiritual Wisdom school have a difficult time giving the crucifixion a meaningful place within the Gospel. In some ways, by this viewpoint, the whole suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried part of the Apostles Creed seems more a distraction from the message of Jesus than an illustration of some moral message. Thus several reviewers have remarked that Mel Gibson has utterly failed in his project by not placing the story of Christ's final twelve hours into a larger spiritual framework the viewer could walk away with.But there is a second approach. This approach believes that the Gospel (and the secret of life for that matter) is not a collection of spiritual wisdom or a code of ethics and conduct. This approach believes that the secret of life is a person. In other words, Christ did not come to walk among us to get us to be better people or live on a higher spiritual standard. Christ came to reconcile us to Himself. He came so that we could place our trust in Him and trust in His righteousness to make us acceptable to a Holy God. In this view, Gibson's movie makes sense. The whole drawn out tale of the suffering Jesus makes sense because Jesus Himself is the point.It offends many that this one man in one particular time and concrete place is believed to be the meaning of it all. It defies all reason and common sense. Yet this is what the faith proclaims. Hence at least some of the criticism this film has received is actually an expression of outrage at this very suggestion.There have been some complaints that in this version of Jesus' death that the Roman Governor, Pilate, is viewed with some sympathy. Indeed, I think Gibson has done just that. But whatever sympathy Gibson shows for Pilate is offset by the ghastly brutality of the Roman soldiers. And troubled or not, Pilate cannot absolve himself of his part in the crucifixion by washing his hands anymore than he can declare himself a bird and fly away.At the viewing I attended, the audience was dead quiet throughout the entire film. No one ate and only a few bothered to drink their sodas-those that did did so only to calm the upset in their stomachs. Surprisingly, the toughest part of the film was not the hanging on the cross but when Jesus is beaten with a variety of whips. To watch a man have the skin ripped from his body is an astoundingly harsh experience for the viewer. It is with this particularly long scene in mind that I cannot recommend this film to younger filmgoers.This is a painful film to watch. Most of the audience cried at some point. A few had to leave the theater. When it was over the audience walked out not speaking to each other. This film is meaningful in the extreme to Christians long familiar with the habits of Lent and Easter. It is definitely a Catholic view of the crucifixion-even so, it is not so oppressively Catholic that members of other denominations would find it distracting. Most leave this film deeply moved and without regret for having watched it.Only time will tell if this film will have a lasting place among Christians. I can scarcely imagine what place it will have in the world of filmmaking. There is no other film like it. The only film I have heard it compared to is Schnildler's List in its depiction of brutality. It could be for that very reason it will be ignored in the long run by the film watching public. Like Schnildler's List, it may be more honored than watched. But this is an important film as a film.

Jesus' face was beaten to a pulp and unrecognizable so keep that in mind if you think the film overdid the beatings. However, the overall effect is that there isn't anything sanitized in this film; it's an according-to-the-Book account and after you see this on film, it shakes you up.I heard that people were so stunned they couldn't speak for about a half hour after coming out of the theaters.

I wish director/producer Mel Gibson had shown more of Christ's resurrection instead of centering 99 percent of this movie on his suffering, although I understand Mel's point.

However, I saw Jesus reaching out with love, trying to teach, through all the torture and barbarity even while on the cross. Tears come easily while watching this film because I know my sins put the whips and hammers in my hands and that Jesus was wounded for my transgressions, bruised for my iniquities, and that with his stripes I am healed.James Caviezel certainly portrays the suffering of Jesus, but more importantly he also always projects the absolute submission Jesus has to God's will and his boundless love for every human. I particularly loved the scene where the man who had been compelled to carry Christ's cross to Golgotha looks into the eyes of Jesus and is tormented because of the love Christ still radiates. I remember one of the negative reviewers said that the words of Christ asking his Father to forgive his tormenters (us) were not in the film. That is wrong. They are in there twice, when he is being nailed to the cross on the ground and another time shortly before he dies.The other actors are fine as well. Hristo Shopov was very fine as Pontius Pilate as was Claudia Gerini as Pilate's troubled wife. Monica Bellucci adds a haunting beauty as Mary Magdalene. However, top honors goes to Maia Morgenstern as Mary. She brings Mary to life as I have never seen before. And when she looks straight in our eyes as she holds the broken body of her son you know she is not condemning us. No, she is asking us to understand what her son (and she) gave for us and asks us to accept that sacrifice and let it change our lives.The actors who played the priests, the vicious Roman guards, and the crowds who called for Jesus' death should all be commended for powerfully playing those thankless roles.

His goal is to show the audience what Christ endured on our behalf, and I think he has done it.The torture, bloodshed and cruelty are shocking and offensive, but that is the way it happened. This is what Christ experienced in the final hours of his suffering on earth. The mocking of the Romans, the accusations of the Jewish leaders, the conflicts of his disciples, and the love for Jesus by the mass of people are all portrayed.The effects of flashbacks during the film to Jesus as a boy, young man, and times with his disciples emphasize his humanness and relationships. The focus on Mary and her love for her son is gripping as we are forced to consider that Jesus is her child whom she has cared for.We see the anguish Christ faces when in the garden contemplating the suffering ahead of him. Satan is present there and throughout the film to tempt and ridicule Jesus.

Although there were several players involved, we see that no person caused Christ death, but he gave his own life.The fact that the language is aramaic and latin is not bothersome at all and I think it adds to the profundity of the words spoken.I can't imagine this movie being done better that it has been done.

To film a movie in Latin and Aramaic was brilliant and the sets and costumes were amazing. I think they could have saved about half the movie budget by having Jesus expend a human amount of blood but that's ok -I realize it was necessary for Gibson to stay true to his fundamentalist Catholic views and strictly follow the stations of the cross in depicting the passion of Christ, even though there is no scriptural evidence for them. Having said this though it is important to point out what a horrible theology this movie presents. It is essentially the Anselmian view that Jesus was incarnated as the only sufficient sacrifice for our sins. As this movie presents it the only significant part of Jesus's life is his death. It is this sort of blood-soaked religious ideology that says it is ok to kill people as a means of purification.Even as an atheist I can see that this is probably the most immoral of all ethical or religious doctrines. If you want a sound theology try Abelard or some of the Franciscan authors. In their writings the incarnation is the culmination of creation, an event that was planned from the beginning and NOT simply a reaction to people behaving badly. It represents the ultimate unification of God with His creation. The moral lesson comes not from the death of Jesus saving us from our sins. (which mires human beings in eternal stupidity and doesn't apparently cure us of sinfulness either ...so it is pretty much a wash) The moral message needs to come from Jesus's life...take care of lepers, eat with tax collectors, help a prostitute get on her feet.

The film doesn't pretend to be anymore than it is: a thorough examination of Christ's passion through graphic (one could not exactly say literal)depiction. Because of the film's intense focus, I gained a much deeper understanding of what exactly the passion of the Divine Christ was: His absolute, uncompromising, and, most of all, completely self-sacrificing love for humanity.By focusing on the essence of Christ's mission, in a brilliant exposition of the film-maker's art - we are shown the exemplication and demonstration of perfect self-sacrificing love, the true Altruism, which He was sent into this world to teach, and the intolerably brutal and vicious way in which we treated Him.To the credit of the film, we are not allowed for a second to forget that God's begotten Son took upon Himself the form of a man, and therefore, was subject to that human sensitivity which experiences pain and travail. And who among us, with all the agony we do experience, could have endured what He did for our sake? Herein, the film shows us what Christian virtue is: to bear our Cross, without complaint or rebuke. The film really does a superb work in showing us that Christ's passion for our betterment was great enough to transcend any agony which we could inflict upon the flesh.I understand the heart of Christ's teaching as stated in the Gospel of John to be thus:1) ... that you love each other as I have loved you ...;2) that ... there is no greater love than this: that one might lay down their life for their friends (or enemies, or anyone at all)...What I don't understand is how one can watch this film and point a finger at anyone, Jew, Roman, Iraqi ... anyone, other than at themselves. I cannot speak for anyone other than myself. I see a lot of people really trying hard to live Christ's teaching, Christian and non-Christian alike. But, I, for one, know if someone hit me with one of those scourging whips what would happen.

As an atheist, I wondered what affect it would have on me. Now that I've seen it, the main thing that strikes me is how very unmoved I was by it. It certainly has great production values. Very impressive cinematography! It's got plenty of lyricism in its directing and editing. I'd heard it was reminiscent of Kurosawa, and it is. But this lyricism robs it of some of its emotional immediacy. Big mistake. Despite the impressive technique, the actual telling of the story is very straight forward. Yes, it's just another Passion Play, with a big budget for fake blood. Of course, Gibson couldn't get too imaginative or creative with it, lest he deviate from the source material. The Gospels are just (supposed) histories, not stories dreamt up for our entertainment. Hence, they can be difficult to fit into a movie format. Kudos for historical accuracy, but the more important question is, did Gibson emotionally connect the viewer with Jesus, so we personally felt he died to pay for our own sins? That may vary with each viewer. I felt no connection at all. Gibson tried a few skillful tricks in order to make the connection, but they didn't work for me. The lyricism I mentioned earlier detracted from an immediate connection. Maybe Gibson got a bit too wraped up with his own snazzy filmmaking technique. Personally, I thought Jesus Christ Superstar was a much more compelling Passion Play film.

This film touched me like no other film EVER has. On more than one occasion I was moved to tears, and I came away spiritually renewed.Is this film violent? Yes, the violence in this film is very unsettling as you witness the beating, scourging and crucifixion of Christ. However, I believe that the violence is justified; Gibson wanted to give as accurate a portrayal as he believed he could to show the magnitude of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, and to do anything less would not have done the film justice.Is the film anti-Semitic? Absolutely not. Anyone who sees this as a slight against Jews misses the entire point of the film, as well as Gibson's motivation for making it. The Passion is not anti-Semitic. It is pro-love.The Passion is also beautifully acted, and Jim Caviezel should win every award in the country for his portrayal of Jesus. Here's an actor who shows that he not afraid to take chances, not I'm not talking about choosing to play the Messiah. Caviezel reportedly suffered pneumonia, a lung infection, suffered a 14-inch gash across his back from being accidentally scourged, and was even struck by lightning during filming. This guy deserves an Oscar just on general principle! Having the dialogue in Aramaic and Latin was not only a stroke of artistic genius on Gibson's part, but it further added to the film's overall authenticity.

198,A1PLRDMBCSULMI,310263662,Daniel Ferrisi,"[9, 15]","Mel Gibson's new film The Passion of the Christ has been greeted with as much controversy and anticipation as any film has been in years. And though this guarantees the film will make huge sums of money from the curious public, it also allows religion and theological clashes to overshadow what the analysis should be focused upon for any cinematic offering: the filmmaking. In that respect, The Passion of the Christ is very similar to recent critical-favorite Touching the Void. For the former, we see an hour of real time scourging, torture and crucifixion. The latter limits itself to about an hour of battling the elements, as a horribly injured man attempts to descend a perilous mountain. The problem in both cases is that an ordeal on film is made to be an ordeal for the audience, as well. Frankly put, too much of the same thing eventually becomes boring.The film begins with terrific atmosphere, as Jesus (Jim Caviezel), who claims to be the son of God, prays in a mystical forest under the guard of his disciples. Jesus knows that the Jewish authority, the Pharisees, believe he is a blasphemer and want him dead. As such, he prays to God mournfully as the specter of Satan attempts to turn him toward the dark side while Jesus is at his most vulnerable. Eventually, the Pharisees seize Jesus and a brief battle ensues. Jesus shakes the determination of one Jewish guard when he magically restores the guard's severed ear.The Pharisees eventually bring Jesus to the Roman ruler of the land, Pontius Pilate, demanding he be crucified for going against their established religious hierarchy. Pilate is extraordinarily conflicted about Jesus, seeming to believe in the qualities Jesus claims to possess. He sends the Pharisees away to seek the rule of Herod instead of his own, though Herod promptly refuses to condemn Jesus and he is sent back to Pilate by the increasingly bloodthirsty mob. Knowing that refusal to follow the will of the people would create a rebellion, Pilate begrudgingly sends Jesus to be scourged. However, even that is not enough for the accusers, led by Caiphas.What follows are essentially: 20 minutes of scourging, 20 minutes of bearing the cross up a hill, and 20 minutes of actual crucifixion. The film currently runs a bit more than two hours and gets tedious; trimming several minutes off the hill walk and a bit from the crucifixion would certainly improve the film's pacing. The visuals are indeed incredible, making us feel as though we are actually in the time and place of the events (the Director of Photography and Production Designer deserve recognition here), but even imagistic richness is not enough to counter endless repetition of the same thing.The same criticism can even be levied against Caviezel, as well as Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci (Mary and Mary-Magdalene, respectively). Though Caviezel totally embodies him here, Jesus spends much of the movie wincing, collapsing or heaving. Both Marys have little to do but cry as they watch the torture unfold. Morgenstern has an expressive face and captures the idea of a mother's grief well, but neither she, nor in particular Bellucci, have a whole lot to do in the movie.Mel Gibson's direction is incredible for visual splendor, but his ideas for pacing and variety leave much to be desired. Though the final moments of the film are uplifting ones, as we do see Jesus come back to life after his corpse was entombed, it seems Gibson's vision for the film was limited to the torture Jesus endured for his beliefs. Though it is no consolation to a bored audience, one can only expect singular focus from such a narrow vision.Regardless of what people may be saying, The Passion of the Christ is certainly not a life-altering experience. It is quite simply an artist's interpretation, of writers' interpretations, of ancient stories. As such, there is no reason for adults to bring children to the film in the guise that it is instructional. This R-rated film is certainly more deserving of an NC-17 than The Dreamers. Far from the stylized mayhem of Kill Bill: Volume 1, this is pure and unadulterated torture that perhaps should have remained limited to the world of nightmares.Final Grade: B-",3,"A Good Movie, NOT a Life-Altering Experience",1078012800,"02 29, 2004",-0.0067

Finally, I get to see what this film... or this true story looks like. First of all, this isn't a film. It was REAL!!! Big time! Now for my review. This movie opens up with Jesus (my favorite character... or person...) who is upset that he has twelve hours to live, because he is about to be crucified. Hours have passed and he was taken to the Romans. After they sentence to punish him, they start beating him up with chains, whips, and other dangerous weapons. I covered my eyes, because it was too painful. After they beat him up, they want to sentence him to death. So they have him carry a cross, while he is severely injured, but Mary thinks about the good times Jesus and her spend, including the close encounter part which really brought a tear in my eye. When we get there, they nailed Jesus on the cross and raise him up, but not before we see a flashback about his bread as his body and the drink as his blood. After he and his cross rose vertically, they knew the job was done, and everyone laughed at him. However, they clouds rolled in, and everyone knew what will happen: After Jesus prays to his father for the last time, he dies and he will be in heaven for sure. Rain starts to fall, causing a huge earthquake. Now, I think this is a little... flat, but the people who crucified Jesus NOW finally realized they did something wrong. They knew they did something bad to him, but it was too late for that. After they release Jesus from the cross, he is held by his mother, Mary. However, in April 3, the first Easter ever to be created, the covers he lied in when he died was empty, because Jesus is living with his father, but, before the credits roll, we see Jesus resurrected, proving that even though he died, he was still alive. I think the ending was so powerful, and, in my opinion, I think it was the best ending ever. It left my heart thumping for good. The only complaint was that there was no English dialouge, but there's not suppose to be an English dialouge, because it wasn't held in our region. I still think it makes sense to me. This movie is the best movie I've seen in Earth, and it should not be missed. GO SEE IT NOW!!! Well done Mel Gibson for giving us the gift of a powerful movie!!!

I had the priviledge of seeing last night and was not disappointed, but I should point out that this is the kind of film which you can't like or dislike. The film stays true or mostly true to the Gospel it's based upon. The film tells of the last 12 hours of Christ's life. The depicitions of the crucifixition are quite graphic and very intense, this film is not recommended to be viewed by children. Though I should also add that it is not the most violent or bloody film that has been made or that I have seen.Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is outstanding and should definetly be nominated for an Academy Award next year along with John Debney's engrossing music score. James Caviezel does a great job portraying Jesus of Nazareth along with Monica Bellucini and others. Mel Gibson is very capable as a director as he is an actor, he certainly proved that to us with the glorious epic, Braveheart. I must say that this film is not anti-semetic in its views, and it certainly should be viewed as a telling of the Gospel. Gibson simply made a movie about the last 12 hours of Jesus's life, he's not making any accusations.The film which opened on Ash Wednesday (2/25/04) has already grossed an outstanding $117.6 over the 5 day period along with $76.2 million over the weekend. It certainly has proved to be a success and of blockbuster caliber, the film's budget was only about $25 million which Mel Gibson put in, in other words he used his own money to make the film. This is the second-highest grossing R rated film after The Matrix Reloaded. Of course you shouldn't see this movie for its success at the box-office, if you're very religious and want to experience a movie which should be experienced by everyone, then see The Passion of the Christ.The Passion of the Christ is rated R for Sequences of Graphic Violence. The violence as stated earlier is intense and brutal. During the crucifixtion, the nails are hammered into Jesus's hands and feet in slow motion, Jesus's body is drenched with blood. There's also an extended scene of Jesus being savagely punished at the hands of malicious Roman soldiers.

Now, regardless of whether these reviewers think the film is good or not, I think it is absolutely dishonest to say that the film is completely not worth seeing. Any film that manages to spark so much controversy and polarize audiences is bound to be worth seeing-if only to get a glimpse for yourself of what people are talking about. So, unlike most of my reviews, I will say upfront: THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is worth seeing. In what follows, I will give you a sense of my thoughts as I was watching the film.During my childhood, I was a practicing Catholic and attended mass every week (often twice). Each year, we would go through the Passion meticulously around Easter. The story would be related several times, the stations of the cross would be observed, and so forth. The upshot is, this is a story that any practicing Christian should know like the back of his or her hand. Yet, despite the fact that I have heard this story so many times and seen so many films about it, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST manages to bring a different perspective and a whole-new-level of reality to the story that just cannot be communicated in spoken words. Sure, I sat there waiting for each of the stations to occur. I waited for the lines. If you grew up in a church, you will know several of the film's lines before they are uttered.But I would like to focus on the film's graphic violence, since this seems to strike the largest amount of controversy in the entire movie. Is it violent? Yes, it is. I would not recommend this movie for children. But I don't know what everyone is so upset about. The Passion is a violent story. The brutality is described in the New Testament and, until Gibson decided to go for it, that brutality has never adequately reached the screen. The story is supposed to center on Jesus, a man who is human and divine, suffering for all of the sins of humankind. His suffering has to be greater than any other human being is capable of withstanding. In previous films and versions, the lack of absolute brutality allows the audience to sit back and enjoy the Passion. But this is not a story that is meant to be enjoyed. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, in my opinion, is the only film that really gets that. Gibson's bloodbath finally communicates, in horrifying detail, the absolute suffering of Jesus Christ.Now, regardless of whether you are a believer, I think you will get something out of this film. I am no longer a practicing Catholic, but that doesn't prevent me from standing back in thoughtful contemplation after this film. It is a good film and it is obviously a labor of love. I think that it will stand the test of time and provide a powerful religious experience for those who are believers. Some have complained that it doesn't preach Christian values. If you think this, you are blind. The quiet suffering of a man dying for the sins of humankind, praying for his torturers, is at the heart of the Christian faith. Do not watch THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST to be entertained.

Seeing him tremble and Pray to God made me feel closer to Jesus in that we know what torture and suffering he would face. The fact that we see Jesus as Human in those last hours is what makes the whole Movie moving. There are scenes that will make a person cringe.

Also Mr. Gibson declares in the most profound and honest way that not just jews or gentiles are at fault for Jesus's death but we ALL are at fault.This movie declares what many missionaries go with their own lives at stake to declare the gospel and say that Christ died for our sins and we are only saved by the grace and love that took Him to that hill and pinned him to his death. The movie does start at the climax of what happened to Christ, yet it shows in such horrific detail what Christ went through for out transgressions. In the most true solidarity and painful humbleness. I found myself in many ways coming out of Mr. Gibson's movie saying exactly what the Pope said.

209,A2MW0RYIXMEYGS,310263662,Dave,"[4, 6]","I'm sitting here a day after having viewed the movie, and I'm still trying to decide how best to describe it. How am I supposed to fit into a puny 1,000 words or less how powerful and amazing this film is? I can't. It's amazing. I'll have to admit (at the cost of my pride) that this film even caused a few tears to stream down my cheeks...something I'm typically determined not to have happen. I've never cried for any other movie, but the utter determination, the love that bound my Savior to the cross was mind-numbing.Yes, it's violent. Frankly, it's landmark for me, being the very first R-rated film I've ever viewed in my life. But it was worth it, I have no regrets. And although you would know the best whether or not you have the intestinal fortitude to watch this, let me just offer you a few of my own reasons why I think you should.Jesus took this punishment for US. YOU should have been bound to that whipping block. I should have. Each and every one of us has sinned against God, and deserves no less than the most painful and brutal death Man can devise, with eternal suffering and condemnation to follow. We deserve that. By God's good grace, we are no longer bound to that doom. If our Savior had what it takes to endure that, to rescue us from that end, it would almost seem to me as if we at least owe him to look squarely in the face that which he endured for us.I've been a Christian all of my life, and generally, I'm guessing it is the case that most people accept the fact that Christ died for us, and we move on. Which is good, of course, don't get me wrong. If we all sat around agape at God's grace, we'd never get any of Heaven's tasks done. But I think the movie changes that acceptance...it forces us to go back and contemplate exactly how difficult of a concept God's grace truly is for our mortal minds to attempt to fathom. It makes us marvel anew. Throughout the film, I kept thinking He bore all that for me. For me!Yes, it's bloody. If you don't think you can watch the film without emblazoning disturbing images on your mind for life, then you probably shouldn't. Jesus died that death specifically so that we needn't suffer it. But I can attest to the fact that I don't think I'll ever picture Christ's death the same way again. To answer the old song's question were you there when they crucified my Lord?, this movie will make you feel as if you were.About those pesky anti-Semitic charges. I'm reminded of the story of Daniel of the Old Testament, wherein Daniel's enemies were searching for a crime to charge Daniel with, but could find none, so they invented one. Besides the violence, anti-Semitism is about the only criticism one can find, and that only because of the hype. (And we all know how concerned Hollywood is about violence!) In truth, the allegation is preposterous. This film is history, dramatized. It is not responsible for stirring up hateful feelings any more than The Alamo stirs up hatred towards Mexicans, or Pearl Harbor against the Japanese.So why does this charge still supposedly remain an issue? The fact is, if you enter this film with the predetermined mindset that this film will contain anti-Semitic material, you know what? You could very well see some. I attempted to find some, and you know what? One can; IF YOU ENTERTAIN THE PRESUPPOSTION, then you'll find it. Because there's no doubt; the Jewish leaders were one of the two primary bodies responsible for the death of Jesus. But the Romans share the guilt heavily. They heartlessly scourge Jesus, beat him, mock him. It was a combined effort. But basically, the point is this. If you exit this movie with anti-Semitic tendencies in your heart, then, if you'll forgive the expression, you're dead wrong. You have no appreciation for the love of the Jesus that this movie is about. Also, you need to realize that if you hate those who put Jesus to death, then you hate yourself. It was your sin and mine that held Jesus to that Cross. To claim that it is the sole fault of either the Romans or the Jews is folly. It was our SIN. Yours. Mine. The world's.Like my subject line said, this movie is brutal, visually punishing. It's painful to sit there and watch the nails sink into the Savior's hands and feet. It's terrible, unbearable. But at the same time, the love that held those nails there, the undying love for you and I that kept Jesus on that cross is staggering -- it's beautiful.Bottom line, the movie is quite violent, and I do not recommend that any child under 15 view the movie. But I do think that it is a very important movie, one that can deepen one's understanding of the greatest gift we've been given.25 stars, out of 10.",5,"Punishing, cruel -- and beautiful",1081641600,"04 11, 2004",-0.0454

The focus of this movie is primarily on the 24 hour period of Jesus' life where he is arrested, tried, sentenced to death and crucified. Flashbacks to events in the gospels and imagined events in his life provide power allusions that help someone who is unfamiliar with Christianity to capture a little more of who Jesus was.I cannot mark this movie down for the blood and gore because that is the direct subject of this event. Of all the passion scenes or movies I have seen, this one captures more of what I read in the Bible than any other movie. (I have a bachelors degree in Bible).Let me recommend this film for almost everyone. For those who are having trouble loving difficult people, this movie will change you. For those who are having trouble forgiving others, this movie will enable you. Not because of the movie itself, but the content of the script-much of it comes from the Bible and is itself exceptionally powerful.As far as the technical side of the movie. The music generally enhances every step of the 'Via Dolorosa', and the slow-motion cut ins are not over done in my view. They enable you to meditate on what is happening. It's like our souls have been marinated in the power of what Jesus did.For those who are unfamiliar...the movie takes place on the Passover Feast of the Jews. This feast celebrates the Exodus of Israel out of Egypt. Another famous movie, The Ten Commandments, has the scene where the Jews put blood on the doorposts of their homes and the death angel passes over them. On that night the firstborn of Egypt died, and Pharoah finally let Israel go. It was memorialized as the Passover Feast. The actual meal was a hastily prepared lamb (blemish free, year old male).Jesus himself is cast as the Passover Lamb, who takes away the sin of the world, but this is never explicitly stated in the movie. One must know the meaning of the allusions to Passover and to the 'Death Sentence' of Jesus to understand.For Christians who grasp all of this, it is a deeply moving visual impression that causes many of us to consecrate ourselves freshly to God. That's always been the effect on my spirit as I have seen this incredible movie.I would not recommend it for children under about the age of 8 or 9 because they cannot understand the real meaning of all these things and it is exceptionally graphic at times.If you have avoided this movie because of the graphic nature of it, I think you ought to sit down and watch it, especially during the Easter season.

212,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,310263662,David A. Dein passafist,"[8, 10]","In my attempt to compose some semblance of thoughts about Mel Gibson's new film THE PASSION OF CHRIST. I must admit I may ruffle some feathers, and create some heated debate. Let me be the first to say any condemnation I place on myself first. Nothing I am about to write is an indictment of any faith other than my own personal self.Religion is such bondage. Whether you like it or not, religion is as flawed and cumbersome as any belief system. This is why I chose at a very young age to be a follower of Christ, because He came and reformed the broken religions, created and instilled a grace I could never deserve.Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is the kind of movie that restores my faith in the cinema. It is moving, sick, beautiful, sadistic, and probably the most challenging two hours I ever spent in a theater. It is the most violent, brutal, honest and powerful film I have ever seen. It the kind of movie I do not ever want to see again and yet probably will see many times, because it is that terrible to watch, but also so compelling. I left the film changed and for the first time in my life, something that I thought was so close to me became more crystal clear then ever. For the first time I saw the true power of cinema and true power of God's ultimate grace. I would offer that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is one of the greatest and most challenging films I have ever seen (sorry Terry Gilliam, but BRAZIL is my number 2 now).As the film opens we see a short verse from the book of Isaiah, (Anyone whose familiar with the Heavy Metal band STRYPER from 80's will remember this verse well):But He was pierced for our transgressions,He was crushed for our iniquities,the punishment that brought us peacewas upon Him,and by His wounds we are healed.-----Isaiah 53:5(NIV)This passage was written hundreds of years before before Jesus Christ was born. According to the New Testement, this verse was written to tell of the eventual outcome of the coming Messiah. It is too bad the high priests of Jesus day were so busy trying to hold onto the religious control of their people that they missed the true Messiah standing in front of them. In their attempt to keep their grasp on the people, they enlisted the help of one of Jesus' friends. They arrested Jesus Christ and carted him away, placing Him in front of the high priest Caiaphas. Then they dragged him in front of the Roman magistrate Pontius Pilate. In a less than valiant effort to save his own skin and politcal power, Pilate pawns this man he believes to be innocent in front of the garish and ineffective figurehead of a king named Herod. Herod sends Jesus back in front of Pilate who does everything in his power to save this innocent man. Alas, he gave the Christ over to the crowd to be scourged and ultimately crucified.The rest of the story involves some of the most realistic and brutal scenes ever put on film. If you thought SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or SCHINDLER'S LIST was hard to sit through, then you cannot fathom how horrible it is watching Christ get scourged, watching metal rip open his skin. I honestly thought I could take it. I was wrong. Any person who thinks mankind is basically good needs to watch how the Roman guards treat Christ. The funny thing is, I realize how easy it would be for me to place myself in the story. How easy it would be for me to follow the crowd and how easy it would be for me to treat this man as badly as the Roman guards treated him.What I loved the most about THE PASSION were the tiny moments when the people who were laughing and scorning Jesus soon realized who they were dealing with. Some looked on with fear like Barabbas or one of the thieves on the cross. Others looked on with reverence like the Roman centurion who pierced Jesus' side or Simon, a young man who was thrust into the story to help carry the cross. It is the small moments of reality that hit these people that make me glad that sometimes in chaos, people can rise above.I also found myself in the same boat as Peter. Here is a man who has followed Jesus to the mountaintops. He promised to stick by his friend forever, yet when the going gets tough, he shows his cowardice by lying and denying his friend. To be honest, I shed many tears after this scene. How many times have I done that to save face? How would I have felt in Peter's situation? How many times have I have sold out my friends for acceptance and to place myself on a higher wrung?Mel Gibson has done the unthinkable. He has created a film that not only incredibly moving, but also accessible. It is hard to try to put the life of Jesus into the context of His death because it seems so pointless. What did this man do to deserve the pain of the cross? Why do people revere Him so much? Why do so many blindly follow? Mostly, why is a man like Christ worth the fuss? It is simple. We as humans treated God like a piece of junk and yet He forgave us. This whole episode was necessary to human existence.The final ten minutes of THE PASSION are both moving and damaging all at the same time. As Jesus dies the screen goes black for what seems like an eternity. It was not nearly enough time to compose myself, but what follows is a sweetly lyrical approach to the resurrection that does what it needs to. So many films leave Christ hanging there, in their own way acknowledging that he may have had a bunch of great ideas, but beyond that, who cares? Without the resurrection, the crucifixion is an innocent man getting the tar beaten out of him for 45 minutes. With the resurrection, the crucifixion is a story of hope and of grace: something I do not deserve.The cast is phenomenal. Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern hit the right cords when they have to. Playing these characters is difficult because there is always a tendency to over and/or underplay them. They also fill in a canvas that borders on realistic and stylized. I do not think anyone with even any ounce of compassion could not be moved by the pain of watching Morgenstern (who plays Mother Mary) and Bellucci (as Mary Magdelene) wipe up the blood of Christ.I would love to hear what those who disagree with me have to say. I would love to hear what those whom have no Christian faith think of this film. Even if you do disagree, do me a favor. If your mind and soul are in for a challenging and deeply troubling film, give THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST your attention. Even if you are unfazed, I promise the film is brilliant, and I have only said that about five films in my lifetime. You may just leave the theater at least a little changed. You may have a sense of deep despair or tons of joy, but you will leave with just a tad bit more compassion.",5,"A Masterstroke, A True Masterpiece",1085356800,"05 24, 2004",0.2016
213,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,310263662,David Anderson,"[8, 14]","Directors Mel Gibson and Michael Moore (Fahrenheit 9/11)stirred controversy in 2004 for their films. Many loved them, many hated them. Regardless, their names were undeniable that year. The Passion of the Christ, Mel Gibson's directorial follow-up to the Oscar-winning Braveheart (1995), takes Christianity to a new level. It stars Jim Caviezel (Pay It Forward) and Monica Bellucci (Irreversable). This film portrays the last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life. Through the graphic images and the powerful dialect is one of the most unforgettable films of that year and of ever. This film doesn't play part fiction, part non-fiction; it plays according to to The Bible and other testaments. This film never holds back on its soul. Meanwhile, it made film history in many ways.Beyond the controversy is one of the most remarkable films about religion. Though occassionally some scenes run too slow, and some text is unnecessarily repetitive, its strengths lie upon its ability to tell a story thoroughly. The emotional aspect never fades from when Jesus is captured to the end. Through the torture, the blood, the humiliation, and the death, some tears may fall. Though the conclusion is unquestionable to first-time viewers, the powerful message remains at its peak. Beyond the last 12 hours of Jesus's life also shares his beliefs and his own faith. Such written quality was approved by many Christian churches and organizations. Therefore, this film became the symbol of their religion.The physical aspects of the film are accurate to those from the actual early first century living through the costumes and the sets. They resemble the pictures from the testaments and history books. The strong demands for them were met beautifully. Jesus's physical state during his torture is wonderfully portrayed with make-up. The blood, the sweat, and bruises add to the powerful standpoint that the film deserves. Through the work, Jim Caviezel may have been mistaken for the actual Jesus Christ. Its close graphic images were necessary to include and were wonderfully crafted, proving the level of pain endured. Such crew-work quality earned this film three Oscar nominations: Best Make-Up, Best Cinematography, and Best Original Score.Though all the actors portrayed their characters wonderfully, Jim Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, and Maia Morgenstern stand out. Caviezel's performance as Jesus Christ could not have been done better. His state of pain in itself, though a few scenes were real, gives new life to this film. This proved highly difficult since he was in that state of sadness or pain through most of the film. Morgenstern's portrayal of Mary proved as emotional as Caviezel's. Though she didn't say much, her facial expressions alone reveal Mary's times, especially witnessing Jesus's torture.Such overall film quality makes The Passion of the Christ worth watching at least once, Christian or not. Due to the graphic nature, this is not recommended for children or the faint of heart. Viewers should use their own discretion. Few will end this film feeling nothing. Therefore, this will surely remain commonly talked about to its viewers, even those who dislike it.",4,The Most Powerful Film of 2004,1111708800,"03 25, 2005",0.1253
214,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,310263662,David Baldwin,"[11, 13]","This is a difficult film to rate because of the controversy it engendered and the phenomenon it became. Generally, with films like this I prefer to wait a while before evaluating them but I will make an exception here. First off, one has to admire the risk that Mel Gibson took in even making this film. He could have contented himself making Lethal Weapon sequels and What Women Want, films that are high concept and high box-office but have no emotional resonance. To make this film as brutally realistic and in Latin and Aramaic took a lot of courage. As for the film itself I found it so powerfully compelling that I saw it three times when it was in the theatres. The depiction of the crucifixion is brutal for a reason; Gibson wants to show us in no uncertain terms that Jesus suffered for our sins because he loves us and the will of the Father was to save humanity. There is no blame allotted here; we are all guilty for the sins of humanity. This film had such resonance for me that sermons that I may have heard in church thousands of times took on extra meaning that was not apparent to me before. As for the acting, Jim Caviezel is more than adequate in portraying the humanity of Jesus. He does not so much capture Christ's divinity but that may be more the choice of Gibson's than the actor's. Overlooked in many reviews is the performance of Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Jesus' mother. Though given little dialogue, her facial expressions say millions of words particualarly in the scenes where she witnesses the suffering of her son. Another standout performance here is by Hristo Shopov as the indecisive Pilate. I would also recommend this film to mature young teenagers despite the graphic nature of the violence here. There is a difference between violence that is instructive and that which is exploitative. On a final note, I wish they had included more extras on the DVD release, at least a commentary by Gibson. Gibson included a commentary on the Braveheart DVD, which I found to be one of the best of it's kind. My guess is that they will eventually put the extras on a future deluxe edition of this film, which is a shame, because I do not think Gibson entered into this enterprise as a cynical attempt to make money.",5,Will Gibson's Version Stand the Test of Time?,1093996800,"09 1, 2004",-0.0556

The familiar images of a Caucasian Christ on the cross had lost their power to horrify, and in turn had lost their power to communicate the suffering and sacrifice that lie at the heart of the central event of the Christian faith. Director Mel Gibson restores its terrible, gritty reality. This is a fully human Jesus that experiences unimaginable torment, not a primarily spiritual being existing above the mortal plane who is merely going through the motions for the benefit of mankind.

However, TPotC is NOT The Bible The Movie, and shouldn't be interpreted according to any particular religious belief or doctrine. This is the main reason why such religious portrayals are viewed as highly controversial accounts, and much becomes muddled or lost when the plot or storyline is overanalyzed as a result. When TPotC isn't seen or viewed as an accurate account of biblical events, and is seen as a grand display of theatrics involving visually stunning physical scenarios not disguised as works of art, is when it results as a picture worth viewing many times over. And TPotC contains an exponential degree of props (of both the physical and intellectual variety - which are prime factors contributing to the outcome of this fine, upstanding work of art). In conclusion, one must leave their theological preferences (as well as religious prejudices) at the door, in order for TPotC to have any real merit of entertainment value (of which there is a high degree). Be warned, as this epic contains graphic images of violence. Language buffs will enjoy the eloquently spoken Hebrew dialects (including the English subtitles).

Crucifixion alone is a very horrible, painful death, but why keep showing scene after scene of beating and whipping and torn and bloody flesh? Just too much. What's the point? The horrible suffering could have been made apparent without so much gore and so much time devoted to it. I am dumbfounded that people found this movie powerful and moving and that it got such high praise. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

People are making such a big deal out of this: the content, all the controversy from the news and people's gossip, Mel Gibson's direction. I hardly heard about this film until just a few weeks, so I felt like watching this film, cause it looked really interseting to see and know what's the hype about it. I have to say, this movie really is...interesting.The Passion of the Christ isn't really about the life of Jesus Christ, but just the outcome of him. It took place in the last 12 hours of Jesus's life in Jerusalem. One of his desciples, Judas, betrayed Jesus, played by James Caviezel, and was captured by a strong religious group known as Pharisees at the Garden of Olives. After being accused as a blasphemer to many, Jesus was then chastised to painful whippings, all then leading to the unforgettable, the crucifixion. During it all, Jesus tries to not lead him to temptation, but to deliver him from evil, ala, Satan. Also during his torturing, there are some arbitrary-yet-significant back stories that further displays the life of Jesus: being as a carpenter, delivering the message of God to his people, and delivering the last supper of his disciples. Again, Wow! Mel Gibson should've renamed this title, The Torture of the Christ, but people say to me that the word Passion meant Suffering at a certain degree. Let me comprehend this: Jesus has gotten spit at, beaten up, whipped, shredded, piercied, and any painful way he went through that not ever the most durable of S&M; freaks can endure...so all that suffering was passion? Thank You, Mel Gibson, now I don't want any kind of pleasure after this.Wow! Critics say this movie is graphic, but I didn't expect this movie would be THAT graphic! The blood, the abuse and torture...excuse me, the passion that happen to the Son of God for whole 126 minutes, not even all of Nine Inch Nails' uncut music videos I've seen would hold a candle to this movie. I believe Gibson knew what he was getting into, and that's how he wanted it, so I applaud for him directing this film. He focused all his past works as an anti-heroic actor, and tries to use it to display the hardship and sorrow of this film, and it made this film work. The well-done direction gives new perspection on the Son of God. I see Jesus bleeding, scarred, scabbed, and ostracized, heck, even the Pharisees rather free a murderer than a blasphemer like him, but he knew the future bleeks him, and he would still deliver the words from God to the people. Even when people around him wanted to see him executed, he loved and forgiving those who has yet to understand God's words. He would even put his soul in vain to repent for the sins the people created. It made me realize that it's not the Jews that are responsible for the death of Jesus, but mankind is responsible. We take our lives for granted, and he sold his life for us knowing that, and I felt like I could've done better with my own life since Jesus risked his passionate life for people like me to have a better one.The Passion of the Christ has one of the best cinematographies around. The ways it showed Jesus's suffering in slow-motion, giving it a more dramatic feel, and how the characters expressed about this whole entity. It's hard to explain in detail about the cinematography of this film, but to put it short, it made the experience felt more real. For authenticity's sake, the characters speak only in Aramaic language, so whether people like or not, this movie's in subtitles. If there is one serious flaw this movie has, I think that it just wasn't completely realized. I may not have read the Holy Bible, but there's gotta be more than just Jesus experience the outcome. It was suppose to send a message to his people after he died and adore him for his sacrifice, and yet after he died, his soul just walked towards heaven and the movie's over. That's that, the message that was suppose to deliver in this movie was nonexistant, and it made me suffer, not only emotionally, but somewhat intellectually.This movie really creep me out, but at the same time, I was really involved with it, and I couldn't believe that I was so involved with a biblical film. The Passion of the Christ isn't everyone's cup of red wine with a side of crackers. People who're religiously-involved, wanting to know more about Jesus, or just weak-hearted by its graphic content might not enjoy this movie so much. It doesn't made me change my mind about reading the holy bible as an interest, but it was the best depicition on Jesus's life I've seen since those lousy TV specials. It may have been controversial to some degree, but people should watch this movie because it's just subliminally engaging.",4,Passion = Suffering?,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",0.0705

But in the actual movie (a film about the voluntary sacrifice of Christ) I found nothing of that sort. Beyond all lesser contexts of tribe, kin or creed, the story contained in PASSION is the far more universal Eternal Drama, that of MAN destroying the best thing that is his, namely the possibility of opening his eyes and seeing change, seeing a way in life to be less violent. We crucify the Truth now today as we always have; with metaphorical stones we continually kill and suppress people and ideas.Why, in the Drama of Christ did Judas even need to 'betray' Jesus before they crucified him? The authorities could have found Jesus without much trouble, so Judas' action makes no sense except for its symbolic meaning. That meaning is: Christ (through Judas) handed himself over to the baser men who could not see what he was, and (if you review the last supper) Jesus essentially commanded Judas to help him. That is missing in Gibson's presentation, although the spiritual suffering Judas must have willingly undertook to play his role is itself portrayed as a horror for any man to endure. But for what purpose, what result? The crucifixion was necessary, fully intended... and at the moment Christ says it is done before slouching down on the cross, we realize something has been done TO the men who brought him there, ie. some deep frightening realization of themselves has been touched. This moment is for all of us, and the effect of the event has not gone away.A very thoughtful film overall. We are made to experience the viscerality of Christ's especially fervent subjection to suffering (and why such fervor?) not just through gory makeup and effects, but equally through the depths of psychic pain we see in the faces of Mary his mother, and his devoted Magdelen. I was never so utterly moved contemplating the event of Christ's death. And never so surprised and elated by the event to follow!Just see it. It is hard to talk about this film apart from it's meaning in Christ's teaching and life, things themselves very layered in meaning.

It was so hard to watch. It literally felt like you were there, watching him be crucified. At times I seriously wanted to turn away but my eyes were glued the whole time. I have to commend Mel Gibson for his bravery. Even though I am not Christian, I have to admit that this film was well done.I do have to say that it is not easy to watch. I literally felt drained after watching this film and I do believe that this isn't a movie that I am going to watch again anytime soon. This was an experience. That is so rare in filmmaking today. But along side the feeling of draining, I also felt inspired. I was touched deeply by this film. It was amazing what Jesus went through for others.Jim Cavavzel (sp) is brilliant as Jesus. He portrayed both the warmth and the compassion that Jesus had for all people. There was something about his presence. The love that he carried in his big brown eyes. As far as being too European, I found he was more realistic than others. I know he was bloodied and beatened but there was something about him that made me want to be near him.Also as well, I want to point out Rosalinda Celentano's performance as Satan.

My father could not tell if she was male or female. I'd honestly like to see her in more things.Another thing that captivated me was the way it was shot and the musical score. It was one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen in terms of cinematography and setting. It felt so authentic. The music was definately moving.

This was not a film about emotion, brutallity, anti-seminism or the cruelty of Rome. This was a power packed film about man's relationship to God. The fact that Mr. Gibson was inspired by his own faith and relationship with God and not emotional content shows the commitment that he has and the courage to tell the story as it was. The cinematography was excellent, the acting marvelous in light of the weighty subject depicted. Some have said that this film is not for children or those of a frail mein. I object and suggest that any child that has reached the age of accountability must see this film so that they can make their own mind up about this event. The weak or frail that are looking for the moment of ultimate truth must see this film. If we look at this film and judge it by the same standard that we judged King of Kings starring Jeffrey Hunter or the Bible with an all star cast then I believe that we miss the point entirely. Mel Gibson is the first director in Hollywood that has the intestinal fortitude (guts) to tell the story as it really happened and please note that often those accused of a capital crime did not survive the scouraging in order to be crucified. God's wrath was not the object of this movie either. Why would God willing send His own son to a horrifying death in order to redeem mankind and then take it out on the very humanity that that death was planned for before Adam and Eve were even created. That would be tantamount to murder. There is much debate about the false doctrine of Evaloution and I submit that this film in all it's cinematic gore and brutallity forces a decision to be made by everyone that sees it. The fact that Mel Gibson invested 33 million dollars of his own finances into this project shows dedication, sacrifice & commitment. Don't forget that those that would not support Gibson financially, now wish that they had, since the movie has made approximately 100 times Mel's investment. Hollywood would rather pervert the Gospels (good news) and portray Jesus Christ as a man with homosexual tendicies than tell the truth, for obvious reasons. It appeared to me that even the cast of this film was changed by it. In summary The Passion of the Christ is the focal point, the pivital point in the relationship between God and man and the attemps throughout the ages of the evil one Satan formerly Lucifer Son of the Morning and the chief archangel of God, to thwart God's plan to redeem (buy back) man from sin and bondage to this current world system. If you miss this point of the film then you reduce the Passion to entertainment and that diminishes all of humanity. I don't care if you are a believer of not, the healthy do not need the services of a doctor, but the unhealthy do. Mel Gibson made a film about a choice between heaven and hell and everyone that sees this film will be held accountable for what they now know are the facts.

Yes, and here is why: so many times do we see religious films that are, in effect, boring. They tell the story, making no -- if not hardly -- any attempts at really showing us the pain; the tragedy; the guilt; and, ultimately, the un-dying love and affection.What The Passion of the Christ doesis allow us to revel in human emotion. Yes it's violent, but the violence only makes it that much stronger. With every bone-crunching sound, we feel Jesus's pain. With every flesh-gouging whip, we share in his torment. With every ounce of blood he loses, we shed a tear. And throughout this ordeal, with every bit of faith, strength and unconditional love he produces, we feel him as a human being, and share in his triumph.Jesus was a great man; he is a great man. Jesus Christ is the ultimate epitome of love, strength and courage. No matter what happened, he stuck by what he believed to be true. And thus, by he end of the film, it is his triumph, not his defeat, that shall be rewarded. Through his masterful direction, Mel Gibson portrays this in such a beautiful way; so beautiful -- almost Heavenly -- that it simply defies what we had always learned about matters of the heart.The Passion of the Christ is a beautiful film. It is also an extremely violent and gory film. But the violence only underscores the emotion and heartache. After seeing this movie, I left the theater in awe, practically in dis-belief of everything I had just witnessed (In fact, I could barely speak during the next ten minutes).If not for the huge amount of violence, we would not have had the build-up for what would eventually become a streaming river of human emotion and heart-ache. It would have been easy for Mel Gibson to lessen the intensity of the violence, but then he would be risking slf-pity; a feeling of self-pity for Jesus. And in a film such as this, we don't want to pity Jesus. We want to love him. To embrace him. To invite him into our hearts. And how do we do this? By feeling what he felt. By experiencing the injusties carried out against him. By eventually soaring with him on eagle's wings up to Heaven; up to where there's no pain; no fear; just love.And that's what we should all aspire for; what we should all aspire to be. He taught us that love -- great, powerful, un-conditional love -- is the ultimate triumph. It is the ultimate gift. That something as awesome as this should not be automatically considered wrong, but rather it should be accepted and celebrated. That taking in younger children is alright, as long as it's in an innocent fashion. This is not innapropriate. It's love. Pure and Godly love.Thus, The Passion of the Christ is not only about Jesus. Thus, The Passion of the Christ is about society in general and its hang-ups on certain issues.And thus, Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ deserves nothing but the highest praise.",5,Masterful Epic; Violence Only Underscores the Awesome Beauty,1092009600,"08 9, 2004",0.1966

THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, unfortunately, seems to perpetuate division--to re-energize those who fervently believe the gospels, to alienate those who fear the film's message will create a Christian ethnocentric backlash. There seems to be little common ground, which is a shame, as the movie should be judged solely on its merits.And THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a powerful, gripping, riveting, often disturbing film depicting the last twelve hours of Christ's life. It is more than obvious Mel Gibson poured his heart and soul into this work--yet the symbolism and interpretation winding in and out of the story reveals Gibson's agenda to magnify the suffering and brutality well beyond suspension of disbelief. His depiction of a surreal, androgynous Satan--a Satan releasing a serpent, a Satan carrying a deformed baby while Christ is being tortured--is not only a departure from the gospels but an artistic gimmick designed to appeal to emotion rather than reason. And it is reason, rather than emotion, that should be addressed when the subject matter of this film is so volatile.Personally, I don't think the film is anti-Semitic at all; but that is a conclusion best saved for each viewer to draw. If anything, the movie was anti-Roman; I was amazed at the consistent portrayal of snarling, sadistic, drunken, and nefarious Roman soldiers. Would it not stand to reason that some of the soldiers--if only a few--would be shocked, disturbed, saddened, or horrified by the events of the day? Gibson would not have us believe so.James Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern, Monica Bellucci, Ivano Marescotti, and the rest of the cast give spellbinding, powerful performances. Morgenstern stands out as Mary, mother of Jesus; her facial expressions alone--as her son is savagely and brutally tortured--speak volumes. I was particularly moved when she ran to assist her son as he fell while carrying the cross; the movie then depicted a flashback of a young Mary coming to the aid of her fallen little boy. In fact, the flashbacks depicting Christ as a young man and as a prophet were wonderful, but few and far between.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST succeeded in that it made me think, and it made me feel; it disappointed in that I could not help but be distracted by a rather zealous agenda.--D.

From what I have gathered according to the scriptures and research into what crucifixion does to the body of its victim, Mel Gibson got it pretty close. Jesus' body after the scourging was just a quivering mass of flesh, the fact that he was able to carry the cross any distance at all was a miracle in itself, due to the massive loss of blood. What a powerful tool for educational purposes; be it Catholic, Protestant or Jewish. We need to understand our common past history, not place blame on any one group, but to bring understanding and health to our communities of faith.I have seen the crucifixion in other movies; King of Kings, Jesus, and Jesus of Nazareth to name a few. But the crucifixion scene always felt too clean for me. It is interesting to note that director Franco Zeffirelli, Jesus of Nazareth, omitted most of the suffering and violence of the crucifixion that Jesus went through because he didn't want to offend the audience. However without the suffering that is depicted in the Passion of the Christ, Jesus is just or could be an ordinary Holy Man or prophet delivering his message from God.The message that Mel Gibson brings across is that his sin, my sin, and your sin put Jesus on that Cross. This is portrayed beautifully by the angles of the camera. To try to make more than this, takes away from the meaning of the passion itself. During the scourging I could sense the tension and angst of the moment, several times I jumped in my seat. Even though I watched this film twice I still felt the same feelings and emotions the second time around. At times I even felt like I was the one who had swung the whip, or just pounded the nail into Jesus' flesh! There were so many surreal moments packed into this film, so much so that I actually felt like I was part of the action. The actors did a marvelous job James Caviezel, as Jesus was the very portrayal of suffering as was, Maia Morgensten, as Mary his mother.Another point that I want to make is that the genre of this film is not easy to put into just one type. Unlike Gibson's Braveheart, this well done film juxtaposes several types of genre: Drama in the form of the horrific due to the violence portrayed, yet historical in nature. (One just needs to study human nature to see the sadistic qualities of the solders, when allowed to vent their frustrations.) Educational since the death and resurrection of Jesus is the cornerstone of the faith of many Christians. I would not say that this film is entertainment. The realism and meaning portrayed is much too deep for that. This is also not a film or movie where one can just sit back and relax, like Schindler's List it catches you in the action and sweeps you along with it.",5,The Cornerstone of Faith,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",0.0949

It's tough to critique this work from a non-religious standpoint - and I am sure the mere existence of a Hollywood-movie must appeal to Christians and religious people in general, as it seems they are finally taken seriously by liberal Hollywood.But let's look at the movie itself; clocking in at what seems to be 3hours plus (in reality, a bit over 2 hours), this movie proved to be very gory, laden with 'effects' (the non CG kind) and, frankly, empty. The movie drags on for most of the time, doing it's job to desensitive you to a gore-fest unseen since the latest Wes Craven flick. You can argue that this story is based on historic truth or is complete fiction - regardless, it borrows from horror movies just as much (if not more) than from much more enjoyable 'bible' movies from Ziffereli's Christ to the old standby Ben Hur. And that's what it comes down to in the end: The movie is pointless unless you want to use it as some evangelical tool. I found it boring and frankly not at all enjoyable (Realizing this is not the happy kind of enjoyment Gibson was going for anyway). ... - the movie's depiction of Jews (who do seem to beg Pilatus for Jesus' murder a lot more than seems plausible, considering he wasn't that nice a guy) is present, but pales in the background of the whole movie. Apart from being more sensitive to Jews, Gibson could have been more sensitive to his poor moviegoers in general.I will say that I applaud Gibson for bringing his 'vision' to screen as he, apparently, intended. The movie feels a lot more expensive than it was. Too bad he didn't leave a lot of room for his actors to act anything besides enduring a record (seemed like 20 minutes to me) flogging scene and other horror fests right out of The Birds or The Exorcist.The movie is bloody, gory, and, to me, devoid of anything new to learn about this person.",1,"Gory, empty and pointless",1077580800,"02 24, 2004",-0.0681

Initially I was pleased with the cinematography and a little dissapointed with the somewhat contrived acting. The opening part of the movie is by far the most interesting and rich in terms of storyline and aesthetic beauty. This part of the movie is what nails it in the two-star range. What ensues, however, is probably the most deplorable attempt at sensory manipulation I have ever witnessed in my life.In a time when neoconservatism and counterfundamentalist-fundamentalism gripped the United States by the jowels this movie made a somewhat fortuitous entrance onto the world stage. As the bells of war sent young American soldiers out on the battlefield to defend Western hegemonic positions by way of the Almighty (Bush's great justification) this movie danced across movie theater screens and attempted to do much more than tell the story of the life of Jesus. This movie turns Jesus into a symbol of cultural supremacy, a source of endless blood and suffering, and the American flag manifested in human flesh.As I sat and watched the hour and a half of torture unfold before my eyes I looked around the theater to see the faces of the families which so many claim to exemplify family values.

Some such as Forrest Gump, We Were Soldiers, Titanic ... but this extremely violent portrayal of Jesus' crucifixion has brought me to complete utter silence. It gave me quite an emotional experience.The movie portrays Jesus living his last 12 hours of life on earth, fulfilling God's Purpose for all mankind -- ALL mankind! Yet sadly, many cultures don't seem to get the picture. The film clearly illustrates the brutal hell Jesus went through, from sweating drops of blood in the Garden of Gethsemane to being pertrayed by a kiss, from facing powerful Roman leaders to being spit upon; from enduring non-stop torment of razor-sharp metal on a whip to finally bearing a rough, heavy wooden cross. I was utterly surprised to notice how many times Jesus had stumbled while bearing that cross, yet I assumed that Jesus was going through utter pain at the same time. Oh friends, he did this JUST FOR YOU!I have to admit something was telling me that I was going to walk out of this movie stunned, so I had to warn my spritual kin with me that this film was going to contain extreme graphic violence. I was right all along! You can't comprehend the intense suffering Jesus went through. He saw it all along. He had a ticket to escape from Jerusalem and go on an expedition or something. He could've left when Pontious Pilate offered him the chance, not once, but many times. He could've blah blah blah -- but He decided not to. He knew all along He was called to fulfill the Scripture.I was not surprised to see other movie goers wiping tears from their faces. I can understand why this movie generated controversy to the media. But hey, we need something like this in a generation where entertainment is venom-saturated. You know what I'm talking about.One final summary is that this is without a doubt the greatest film which portrays Jesus' crucifixion.

It is not typical movie loosely based on anything, which usually means there are some true parts and some fake parts. This film follows the Bible completely and is therefore a wonderful teaching tool and extremely powerful experience.What I loved most about The Passion, was that it gave me something I'd never had in church. I've read the Bible, I've paid attention in Sunday School and Church and I know what Jesus did for me when He died so that I might be saved. On a CEREBRAL level and with my faith, I know it and believe it. However, this film gave me a solid VISUAL that grabbed my heart and brought it in line with my mind and faith. Knowing & believing is one thing. But to see with my own eyes how much Jesus loved me is an experience which I will always cherish. I believe it will do this for you.Yes, there is a tremendous amount of violence. And quite frankly, I find it funny that people in THIS country (USA), home of the murderous villians responsible for the almost total genocide of Native Indians and the kidnapping, rape, enslavement and death of Blacks for over 300 years, would have the audacity to pretend they are shocked by the violence of the film. I attribute this to the hypocritical nature of people in the US who are so desperate to remove GOD from everything (except the money, of course), that they would even dane to complain about violence in a movie; sort of like Mike Tyson complaining about someone pinching him. What you see in this film is what actually happened. And you NEED to see that to have a full understanding of what Jesus suffered and WHY.There were sniffles throughout the theatre during the film and I had to grab a tissue or two myself. However, when the first nail is driven into His hand, that's when I broke down and truly experienced feelings of being completely unworthy of the sacrifice, yet thankful that He was willing to give His life in such a way for me. This also marked the first time I'd seen a film where NO ONE jumped up at the end. Everyone sat and had to recover before moving from their seat. Powerful!If nothing else, the film The Passion of the Christ should truly teach you how to forgive. For, as Jesus was beaten to within an inch of His life, nailed to the cross, hung, bled and prepared to die, He still spoke out Father, FORGIVE Them For They Know Not What They Do.Kinda puts that whole she cut me off on the highway and now I want her dead thing into perspective, doesn't it?Dr. Braxy :o)",5,Powerful Is A Soft Word To Describe This One!,1083196800,"04 29, 2004",0.0286

I thought that, on second viewing, the movie would just fly by, as so often happens when you resee a film. On the contrary, I found it long and, at one point, I actually started nodding off. (Not during the flogging scene, I can assure you of that. I felt more distant and remote then, less viscerally affected by the violence.) While I didn't like The Passion any better, I did come away with a greater understanding of the imagery Gibson uses -- more specifically, its roots in scripture. For instance, I realized that he was portraying Judas as mad -- possessed, in fact -- based on the gospel verse that says, The devil entered into him. At the beginning, when Jesus steps on the serpent and kills it, that echoes a verse in Genesis: He shall crush thy head, and thou shalt lie in wait for his heel. This verse has traditionally been seen as God's promise of a Redeemer for a fallen humanity. The problem is, how many moviegoers today will be aware of these biblical references -- even Christians? Gibson's film is obviously a testament to his own faith. But he has made the assumption that everybody else shares that belief, and has thus made a film that, in effect, preaches to the converted. What about those who do not believe, or who simply do not know about Jesus? Gibson's Passion will not reach them because it does not speak, does not even try to speak, their language. The other problem is that Gibson's version of the death of Christ is a hodge-podge of biblical influences, popular piety and his own idiosyncratic touches. Jesus's trek along the Via Dolorosa reflects, not the gospels, but the Stations of the Cross you find in every Catholic church. Many of the 15 stations portray events not mentioned in the gospels. Again, how many people in the audience will be able to separate fact from fiction? One final note: The Passion has been accused of fostering anti-Semitism, yet it tells the story of One who was Himself a Jew. More than that, His death took place against the backdrop of one of the holiest days of the Jewish calendar, Passover. When Mary says, Why is this night different from all other nights? she echoes the question asked by the youngest male member of every observant Jewish family on Passover night. And Jesus's Last Supper was a Passover meal. This is hinted at, but not fully brought out in the film. In short, Gibson takes too much for granted, assumes that his audience shares his knowledge of the Christian faith -- and misses a golden opportunity to explain that faith to others.",4,Preaching to the converted,1219968000,"08 29, 2008",-0.0003

Instead, we have a vivid, shocking picture that you won't be able to forget.This is, in essence, a cinematic passion play: We are shown Jesus's (Jim Caviezel) temptation by a surprisingly eerie Satan (Rosalinda Celentano), and his arrest by the Romans. His apostles flee away, leaving his mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern), follower Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) to follow him on the road to where he would be crucified...&quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was one of the unexpected hits of the last year -- it had a tiny budget, a seemingly small fanbase, and was made strictly according to the Catholic New Testament. But it struck a chord in people -- not just the subject matter, but the fact that Gibson was so dedicated. Much to Hollywood's surprise, people raced to see the controversial flick.While some accuse Gibson of revelling in the gore, with a little bit of thought his &quot;Passion&quot;'s point comes through. It's horrifying to imagine a person -- let alone an incarnate god -- going through such horrors. But when it is realized what the point of all that suffering was for, it becomes a work of beauty. The biggest problem would be that Gibson spent little time on the idea of Jesus being resurrected, which was the whole point.Jim Caviezel gives a stunning performance as Jesus Christ. Whether it's trying to pray through Satan's prattling or speaking to Mary and John from the cross, Caviezel brings every scene to life. Morgenstern is low-key wonderful as the sorrowful mother who has to watch her son killed by inches. And the beautiful Belucci is equally outstanding as the horrified Magdalene.Yes, it's in Aramaic and Latin. But if the language doesn't hold you back, the beauty of the script can shine through. And Gibson's direction is equally stunning, utilizing rapid camerawork and plenty of flashbacks to make Jesus's struggle even more poignant. At times -- the table scene -- it's more than slightly awkward. But it's easy to forget that by the next scene.It's a shock. It's a controversy. It's a one-of-a-kind film, based on a part of our culture that was underrated by Hollywood.

It has been claimed to include non-stop strong images of graphic violence, and it has been claimed not to show enough of the teachings of Jesus Christ. To me, all of those three things are not in the movie. The films shows nothing about blaming the Jews for the death to Christ, it showed enough violence for us to know how Jesus must how felt, and it showed enough of the teachings of Christ to show how good he was in his life. The Passion of The Christ was directed by Mel Gibson, and it is not only one of the best films of the year, but it is also one of the most provoking, thoughtfeld film of the year. It is about the final twelve hours of Jesus Christ's life. People claim that the film has too much violence, but if you think about, the final twelve hours of Christ's life was a very violent few hours. Mel Gibson is only trying to show us what Christ went through to save our sins. The movie has beautiful scenery, and I believe it was filmed in Rome. There wasn't that many sets, so most of the film was outdoors in Rome. The emotions were brilliant. The people watching this terrible thing happen to Jesus were either mortified, or glad.When the film starts, Jesus and his disciples just concluded the Last Supper. Jesus is in The Olive Garden, having a talk with Satan and trying to resist the offers of her. But he is betrayed by Judas, who tells Caiphas, and other Jesus priests, where he is located. They arrest him on sight, and Judas gets away with thirty silver pieces. Accused of religious crimes, Caiphas brings Jesus to the Roman Govener Pontius Pilate, because Caiphas wants him excuted, but only the Pilate is able to carry out such an order. Pilate is torn about what to do, but takes his wife's advice to spare Jesus. Pilate lets the people decide who should be freed, Jesus or a criminal. They let the criminal be free, and Pilate allows for a fair punishment for Jesus, but he doesn't want them to kill him. In front of the eyes of his horrified mother, Mary, and Mary Magdalene, they flog Jesus, letting him live, but with hundreds of cuts and scars.Jesus returns to Pilate, and they call for a crucifixion. Pilate does not want this, but he allows it, and Jesus suffers and suffers untill the point where he finally is dead.Jesus was nailed onto a cross, and the film goes through the stations of the cross, as he brings the huge wooden cross to a certain point, but he falls many times, and with the aid of anothor man, his suffering is still great, but a little more easy. The film has to show all of this, but they show enough to make you feel that you were actually there. They did not show the graphic image of every whip hitting his flesh, or they don't show the nails hitting the bone, but they show enough of it. It was really brillant how Mel Gibson was able to direct these people who were great in dipicting Jesus and Mary, and all the other people in the Bible. The story is a very sad one, but it is also very real. It is in Latin with English subtitles, so that made me really feel like I was there, because it was the language that they spoke at that time.The Passion of The Christ should get many Oscar nominations next year including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Score, Best Adaptated Screenplay, and Best Director, among other awards. It is truely a great film, but it is not for everyone. I didn't think that it was as gory as everybody says it was, but I stress that it is one of the violet films that I have ever seen.

This set includes the theatrical (original) version and a new recut version with I've come to call the PG-13 cut becuase it removes around three or four minutes of the harsh violence toward Christ that the theatrical version contained. The recut version is the cut most likely to be shown by churches and viewed by families due to the fact that the level of violence and bloodshed is greatly reduced. I aslo have to mention the special features on the second DVD. All the features are wonderful and very informative. As a student of film it is very interesting to see how Mel Gibson and crew created this Biblical epic. There are also features that just focus on the Biblical history and truth of Christ and his followers that have nothing to do with the making of the film.

But in Mel Gibson's new film The Passion of the Christ the fine drama is turned into coarse melodrama, as Gibson concentrates on flaying, blood-flying violence, the kind that appeals to the same people who flock to slasher movies. In fact, there may be those eagerly awaiting The Passion of the Christ 2: Peter Gets His. Of course, there is violence in classic art. The Christian iconography of the Renaissance has canvas after canvas of whippings and nailings; but those images are static and stylized, not the graphic naturalism of motion pictures. Speaking of which: Gibson, in promoting the movie, has emphasized how realistic his picture is, an oblique put-down of the Biblical epics of he Fifties and Sixties. Granted, many of those productions were artificial and sometimes not even very entertaining. (At the risk of being hunted down by the NRA, I must admit I think Ben Hur is about 45 minutes too long.) But the fact is The Passion of the Christ possesses the same artificialities as those old films -- presenting, for instance, a tall and handsome Jesus. There is a very strong likelihood that the historical Jesus looked more like Woody Allen than Jeffrey Hunter, but Gibson's realism evidently didn't extend into casting. There are also some unfortunate lapses into what can kindly be called poetic license, including a sit-comish flashback where Mary is confused by a modern table constructed by her smart carpenter son. I'm giving the picture two stars, one for the cast's restrained ensemble acting and one for the superb photography of Caleb Deschanel.

I personally thought the movie was an over-the-top freak show. A carnival of horrors and stupendous lack of imagination that almost bordered on plagarism, of course with Gibsons trademark realistic violence. I like Gibson as a director, Braveheart is one of the best Hollywood Epics ever made, maybe even the best. His deft touch on emotional chords was admirable, and made for a heartbreaking, tragic, and moving story. Now, I know his intention here was to show the brutality, the plot was merely an afterthought, but still even the brutality was muted. It just ISNT that violent, it wisely leaves most of the violence to the imagination, you see the barbed whip, you see its effects once, but most of it is just reaction shots and well placed sounds. I'm going to go out on a limb and just say the crucifixation of christ is the end of a great story not the story itself, Jesus was a great man who met a brutal end, but it is not for me that the brutality makes it harrowing, it is for what he died. But say what you want, it wasn't anti-semitic, people who want to see it will, and people who don't won't. There is obnoxious overpraising and overcriticism on both sides. The onnoxious Christian side says Hollywood doesn't like it, where Hollywood is a thinly veiled cynical replacement for Jews. The obnoxious critising side says Gibson is an insane Holocaust denier anti-semitic and has a parking spot reserved in hell, hardly intelligent criticism. So as it is impossible to see the movie without the hoopla, it is for me impossible to see the big deal, hardly a movie that moved me to a tear.

Never in my life have I been so affected by a film, involved with the characters, awed, and never have I cried so much. Let it be known that this is coming from a person who does not attend church regularly. I loved this film not because it was based on the Bible, but because it was a well-made film that had an amazing story of love, sacrifice, courage, and forgiveness. The whole experience is very spiritual and very personal; there is something in this film that will strike a nerve with everyone who sees it.There are concepts in this film that apply to and can be understood by all of humanity, no matter what your race or creed may be. Such as the tender mother-son relationship between Mary and Jesus, the pain a mother, Mary, feels when she sees her son suffer, or the concept of sacrificing yourself for a cause so great even you do not understand its full meaning.Aside from the emotional impact of The Passion, this is a great film by technical standards. The direction by Mel Gibson is superb and I am so impressed by his passion, drive, and determination, to get this film made. The acting of James Caviezel, Monica Bellucci, Maia Moregenstern, and the rest of the cast does not even feel like acting, it feels real. Caviezel, Bellucci, and Morgenstern become Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Mary. It is easy for the viewer to forget that they are, in fact, watching a film and not witnessing the actual events themselves. What a movie! The score by John Debney and the cinematography by Caleb Deschanel are both stunningly beautiful and enhance the film's impact by enormous proportions.The anti-Semitic charges levied against this film are disturbing and upsetting. In no way, shape, or form does The Passion promote anti-Semitism. The only people to walk out of the theater with anti-Semitic feelings are people who already harbor those beliefs.As the story is set in a Jewish land, the people involved in the story are mainly Jewish, some good, some not. As Roger Ebert said of the characters, Each one representing himself, none representing his religion. The actions of Jews in the mob, government, and those in the priesthood do not condemn an entire race. This film condemns those people themselves and THEIR ACTIONS ALONE. In addition, Jews amongst the crowd cry out against the torture, the Jewish Simon helps Jesus carry the cross, the Jewish Veronica wipes Jesus' face, Jews in the priesthood are against the crucifixion, and Jesus himself was a Jew. Most importantly, the Jews did not kill Christ. No one single person is responsible. Jesus died by God's will for all of mankind's sins.

Reading through the negative reviews most of it was degrading and rather common place bashing, yet some of the negative reviews raise some important points (And I'm not only referring to the gore here) and some of these do more good than a fanatic review. Yet, as a Christian myself, I know I cannot judge this movie without ever looking at my own belief. I was on the way of becoming an atheist and completely lost my faith in God when my mother got cancer and battled it for years. Yet she, the one who was really suffering, took great comfort from praying, reading the gospels and so on. It was this very disturbing experience (My mother's painful death) that made me think. And then I heard about this upcoming movie... The rest is history.Well, for starters, Jesus HAS lived on this earth and was crucified as several Roman historians and more prove. I encourage everyone to watch the BBC Production of Jesus from Nazareth for an IMHO historical and rather rational view on the most loved or hated man that ever lived. An great addition would also be the German 2000 Jahre Christentum which can be bought on Amazon.de. Now what happened after Golgotha is up to what you believe or not. But I would never dare to ridicule someone for believing in whatever he chooses because faith is something very personal. That is why reviews that attack those who believe in Christ disturbed me more than the movie. If logic rules the world: Why would those sarcastic atheists even bother to watch a movie on a person they do not respect?As for Antisemitism, I saw none of it. The Romans were portrayed as bloodhounds, not the Jews. And remember, Jesus himself was a Jew. And just because some weren't good people doesn't condemn an entire people, I believe that if we're as smart as some reviewers who cried Antisemitism! proclaim we are, we should be past that. There are not so good Americans, Austrians, Australians, Chinese as well as not so good Jews. We're all fallible, aren't we? Just as not all the Germans were not has horrific as movies like Schindler's List or Hasenjagd portrayed the really evil ones, not ALL the Jews were good or bad either. There are black sheep everywhere. Why does something that common place even have to be explained? The whole movie wouldn't work if ALL the Jews had wanted Jesus to live, just as Schindler's List wouldn't work if ALL the Germans had opposed Hitler's scheme. (I'm not comparing the holocaust to Jesus' Passion, I'm merely trying to explain why it wouldn't be plausible in another way) What am I saying? Don't regard a movie just as either Black or White. This movie, with all its crude gore, doesn't white-wash anything as much as it doesn't blacken history. It is realistic, painful to watch and made me throw up more than once.It's not entertainment but a reminder of what has been and what has been played down in most versions on Christ's life, esp. King of Kings and The Greatest Story ever told. An example of playing down would be how Caesar's murder has been put on film numerous times. Most of these neither follow the historian's GORY descriptions nor do they dare to show what is described in all its gruesome details. The closest version to the actual event as described is the mini-series with Jeremy Sisto as Caesar but even that one is easy on the eyes. Now The Passion shows that Jesus didn't die as beautifully as the famous paintings made us think he did. It was gruesome, gory, inhuman, sweaty, dirty, swollen, bloody, ripped... you name it.As for the movie's power: The score alone is enough to go straight to the heart. There are several gems of masterful directing in this movie that I won't ever forget. (Such as the Ecce homo!) Which brings me to the subject of Mel Gibson: Neither the sad fact that Mel's father denies the holocaust (A belief Mel does NOT share and shouldn't be condemned for) nor his personal life or opinions on women's rights or whatever should influence your judgement. What did one NEGATIVE reviewer ask for? An IMPARTIAL view.Now would I ever watch this movie again? No. I cannot bear it. THe experience is unlike any other. It rips you apart, each lash has the power of a stabbing dagger. The gruesome details are too much to stomach. But I'm glad I had the courage to watch it. I'm glad for it as a Christian for this vivid presentation of HIS suffering I have realised that whatever makes me feel blue is nothing compared to real suffering. Codemn my belief all you like but I cannot disregard this film and its influence in a positive way. HIS message was love. And atheist or Christian, that doesn't sound like a bad idea.

The point of the movie is in the title of the movie: The point of Christ's life was to die for mankind and rise again and thus fulfill the plan of God the Father as laid out in the Scriptures.The means, his beating and crucifixon, was Christ's passion as a diety wanting to demonstrate an unbound love for his creation, even when his human side (our human side) desired to satisfy and protect the self instead.The passion is so well portrayed in this movie that I'm left with a deep awe as to what is such a well known story and left with the implications of what if it is all true? What if Christ is the true God who came as a man to die and rise again to give us a choice. . .to give us the opporutnity to take our cruel, self-serving ways and now have an avenue to approach a God that is without blemish?What if I choose to grasp the fact that the story of the crucifiction is much more than a historical account of an innocent man receiving the death penalty? What if I truely understand that though things aren't always obvious or visible (as demonstrated with the Satan and demon scenes of the movie) that Jesus was more than a man, that more was at stake in the battle between Good vs. Evil and that fulfilling a destiny at the cost of self is the greatest act of love, mercy, heroism and everything noble that we should all strive to be more like?To watch such a well directed and well acted movie that has the focus of changing lives can't but leave me dumbstruck. For anyone to watch this movie and not think twice or three times about the implications of their actions, the implications of their choices on their eternal future would only demonstrate denial and/or shallowness of character.I don't expect everyone to get it.

But that in no way should detract from the person who doesn't get it to seek further, and try to understand deeper and question more.I'm so glad I watched this and can see it being a regular reminder as to what was sacrificed for me as blemished being and what is available to all if we choose to believe in the Passion of the Christ and the message of eternal life that awaits all those who embrace this passion.There are those movies we watch and love because they make us laugh.There are those movies we watch and love because we relate or think the action cool.Then there are movies like this that we watch and maybe have to grow to love but are left with something more than 2hrs of entertainment.

It's obvious that most Christians find this movie rather graphic, and incredibly moving, because this violence is being done to Jesus. True, no other film has shown Jesus's execution with this much attention to detail.

In fact, the only reason I went to see it was because the dialogue would be in Aramaic, Hebrew and Latin. I wanted to hear what Jesus' words sounded like in Aramaic.Was I surprised! From the very start, this film was different. I'm a Christian, so I have a bias toward the subject. However, I wasn't expecting the high level of artistry in its treatment, in its filming, lighting, storytelling, and imagery. It felt like a foreign film--that is, sophisticated and daring. This is NOT sword-and-sandal spectacle.From the heavy atmosphere of the Garden of Gethsemane, with its thick mist in blue moonlight, to the Mediterranean light of stone courtyards, and eerie overcast sky above Golgotha, Gibson creates an ancient Jerusalem that seems to surround the viewer. I felt a chill in the garden, almost as if I were there, wrapped in the mist. From here forward, one is pulled along, between moments of frank, intense dialogue to moments of grand mal-dreamlike violence (the arrest of Jesus in the garden) or softness (Jesus' affectionate banter with his mother). The movie throws one off balance, shattering expectations, leaving the viewer disoriented. It was a story I knew well, but Gibson somehow made it new and surprising.There is terrible violence in this film, and there are reasons why people may object to it--especially the scene of Jesus' scourging at the hands of Pilate's soldiers. Usually films leave this sort of thing to the imagination. However, I understand Gibson's decision to dwell so graphically on this stage of the Passion. You can dismiss suffering you don't see. But when it's pushed into your face, you have to face it. I had not realized what scourging meant until I saw this scene, and it gave me a painful shock of realization that I and my sin were responsible. Judging from the sound of soft sobbing from other parts of the theater, others had the same flash of realization.This film could have been mawkish, trite, tepid, politically correct.

People either find this film a masterpiece or completely hate it and dismiss it as an ultra-violent snuff film with no merit. It seems that people's opinions are based on where they stand religously and I can certainly understand that. So I'm not going to add fuel to the fire. I'm simply going to talk about the technical merits of the film and the historical aspects that are covered in this movie. Also I will talk about the transfer to Blu-Ray since this is the film's debut in High Definition.The Passion is without a doubt, a showcase of Mel Gibson's filmaking know-how. He has certainly mastered the art of epic filmaking. Every frame, every scene, is beautifuly concieved. The pacing is pretty flawless and given the fact that the film is mostly spoken in a dead language, it is incredibly easy to follow and understand. A lot of hype surrounded the fact that the film would be done in the now defunct toungue as well as latin but in the end it doesn't matter. This is a visual feast. The subtitles simply confirm that you are understanding the scene at hand. In this film, the visuals and the incrdible score do most of the talking.Historically, the film is pretty accurate. I'm not talking about the Biblical aspects of the film (in that respect, some liberties were taken regarding what is written in the gospels). Whether you believe in the Bible or not is a very personal thing. I'm talking about how the time of 30 AD is portrayed and how the romans dealt with prisioners in that time. The rawness and brutality of the era is very well captured. Whether we can bear watching or not, whether we believe it is too violent for film or not, the fact is that this is how the romans tortured and crucified prisioners in the first century AD. It is brutal and raw. Whether showing that has any cinematic merit, I leave to the viewer.When first popping this BD on my player I got worried. The opening scene in the garden of Getsemani is, by HD standards, horrible. I don't know if it was the day for night effect that was used or the colors or what but this scene simply did not transfer well to HD. It is very grainy, lacks sharpness and the colors are subdued. I was about to think I had wasted my money when the scene ended and then all changed. After we leave the Garden and head to the other scenes in the film, the film comes to life in HD. Rich, beautiful colors, awsome blacks and great contrast. The textures come out clean and clear right down to the fabric in clothing. The slow-motion scenes (and there are a lot of them in this film)come to life on Blu-Ray. Overall an awsome transfer and one that showcases what High Definition is all about.Very Hard to review this film but if you pass by the religious controversy that surrounds this film, there is a lot here for the fan of filmaking and now for the fan of HD.",4,Amazing Film and Transfer,1249776000,"08 9, 2009",0.1006

Instead of just putting the words of the gospel to be simply acted out Gibson has managed to also put across the intended message behind the words to the viewer as well. Films of Christ in the past seemed to be shallow and lacking any substance as they seemed to be afraid to go beyond just the superficial reading of the material. This film is violent and uncompromising because it tells it as it is; crucifixion never was a cake walk and the Romans were extremely brutal conquerors. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual episode was a whole lot more violent than was depicted. Gibson clearly intended to make it clear that the Passion of Christ was an incredible act of love of God for mankind. A scene from the film in a flashback when Jesus says that no greater love exists than for a man to lay down his life for the sake of another emphasises this point. To see the extent of the suffering and painful, humiliating death of an innocent for the sake of those that even hate him is what makes this film so powerfully moving and as a result, this film successfully brings across the true meaning of the word of God to the audience.Christians feeling down or going through a dry spell should stop feeling sorry for themselves and put this dvd on to quickly remove any doubt whatsoever that their God loves them and has given everything, including himself, so that they can be truly free. Now all we have to do is to exercise our free will wisely; the choice is ours. The only part that left me a little disappointed is the continuing error of wrongly depicting Mary Magdalene as the sinful woman who was accused of adultery. If there is a patron saint of mistaken identity or of people who have been framed then Mary Magdalene should be it! Nowhere in the bible does it say that she is the sinful woman or even the one who bathes Jesus' feet with her tears; all that's said is that she had 7 demons cast out from her. Hence the scenes of Mary of Magdala's flashbacks took away a bit of the film's impact for me. Having readThe Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christwhich by the way is a must read if you want a proper accompanying book of the film, I was very pleased to see how accurately this film was in depicting one of the source material from which this film is based.I sincerely hope that this is not Mel Gibson's last attempt at a film based upon the bible and if he does say the Book of Maccabees, we'll get a chance to see how the whole Pharisee sect got it's origins and how based upon this traumatic period of Jewish history the pendulum of extremism swings so radically to the opposite side to the point that it led to the total intolerance and hence the passion of Christ as depicted in this film. In zealously trying to reclaim orthodoxy and to move closer to God after the Hellenisation period of Ephiphanes, this new order arose to ironically achieve the opposite by the time of Jesus. A film based upon the Acts of the Apostles would also be appreciated perhaps based upon Paul's journeys. There is nothing anti-Jewish about this film given that Jesus and his apostles themselves were Jews; if anything this film is anti-evil, anti-violence and anti-falsehood showing us that peace, love and tolerance is infinitely more preferable. Mel Gibson proves that he knows how to make movies based upon the intent behind the words of scripture.The picture and sound quality especially in DTS surround format is excellent making this dvd standard format an excellent addition to your video library. Required regular watching for all adult Christians and comes very highly recommended!Updated: 16 April 2012As Amazon will not allow me to review this separately, I've appended this update here: the Blu-Ray version of the Definitive Edition of this film is a vast improvement over the standard dvd and is now the optimal version of this film on disc.

He bore the punishment that we all deserve. He did this because He loves every one of us. Jesus (who is God) lived a life completely without sin, and served as the perfect sacrifice in order to cancel our debt of sin. God created us with free will. While we are all held responsible for our choices, God, in His Perfect love and fairness, held Himself accountable for our ability to act against His will. In John 15:13, Jesus says: Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. In Romans 5:8, the apostle Paul explains: But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us. What Mel Gibson was trying to capture in this movie is a chilling representation of what our God was willing to endure to make the relationship with humanity right again. All that He asks for in return is faith and repentance. We do not deserve such uncommon grace from the One whom we show contempt toward each time we sin. Salvation is a free gift to all who are willing to accept Christ, and His sacrifice on the cross. We cannot earn this gift. This is why it is called GRACE. A God who was willing to suffer humiliation and an excruciating death, in order to make eternal life with Him possible for everyone, is simply AMAZING!

As for the detractors, they seem to fall into two categories: (1.) incoherent ramblings from some who prove that atheists are not intellectually superior to Christians; and (2.) others who were offended by the violence.As a mainstream Episcopalian who majored in biblical studies, I have seen no other movie on this subject that has so accurately conveyed the brutality of the Roman Empire or the cheapness with which life was regarded in the ancient world. The graphic violence we find so distasteful was just another day in the Empire 2,000 years ago. There is no sin in graphically communicating this truth to modern audiences.One wonders if these detractors would be so critical of a film that portrayed another event, say, the tragic murder of Matthew Shepherd by homicidal monsters, in all its savagery. It's likely they would hail the courage of the directors in doing so.

This is just like a big action movie, lots of blood and gore and people fighting and running around screaming. Mel seemed more interested with the violence and blood than he did with the message.

The use of lighting is wide-ranging, to the point of too much instead of too effective. What I could not grasp was exactly what the movie was trying to say. It seemed to me that the movie was just trying to deliver a visual impact but otherwise offered nothing much of substance. Don't get me wrong.

Some of the movie is of Catholic influence, but the majority of the story is the same. No, this isn't too violent, this is exactly what happened to Jesus 2,000 years ago for us. If anything, it was even more violent than what was shown on the movie.My only complaint is that they focused on the most important part of the story, the crucifiction for our sins, but not really on anything else. They had segments every now and then of flashbacks, mainly when Jesus saw something it reminded him of something he did in his ministry in the past. I would have liked to have seen more of his ministry as well as his trial and cross. They resurrection at the end was a little short since it doesn't tell what happened after he walked out of the tomb alive.Jim does an excellent job at portraying Jesus. Perfect for the role, and if you know the behind the scenes story, he went through a lot to do this movie, everybody did.Overall, this is a fantastic movie that shows what Christ Jesus went through for our sins, but it left out some back story. This movie would probably be understood better by those who already know the story. In the movie, they talk of his miracles, but never actually really show any of them.

A serpent slithers from Satan toward him; Christ crushes it with his foot. Thus begins Mel Gibson's controversial The Passion of the Christ, a film that has sharply divided both Christians and cinema critics.At moments this is a fine film, indeed an occasionally brilliant one. The cast is excellent; the use of Latin and Aramaic is remarkable; the cinematography exceptional; the production values are first rate. But The Passion is also an extremely inconsistent film that repeatedly undercuts itself through Hollywood flourishes and excessive fiddling with the Gospels on which it is based.In truth, the film says less about the Gospels than it does about the way in which director Gibson reads them. The film is extremely homophobic, first presenting Satan as a multi-sexual entity and then depicting Herod and his entire court as a host of screaming drag queens. The film is also, in my opinion, extremely anti-Semitic--but in a way that many will find hard to pinpoint, for it achieves that tone through the way it is cast and the way various characters are played off each other.What the film isn't is greatly spiritual: with copious amounts of blood, it is more about the hell inflicted on the body than it is about the soul that transcends the torment. And it is here, really, that Gibson most vividly overplays his hand. After a certain point the violence becomes unbelievable, and I found myself wondering more about the special effects than I was actually caught up in the movie.If you've never bothered to learn exactly what sort of horror a crucifixion was, The Passion will certainly enlighten you--and at times it may even move you to tears. But ideally you should read all four Gospels and do a survey of Roman Catholic tradition re the passion before you walk in the door.

Mind you, Tom has been flagillating himself so much in his recent pictures, that he probably decided on a break. Besides, Jesus doesn't wear a mask. Instead, they got a chap who looks uncannily like Daniel Day-Lewis. In which case, why not get Daniel Day-Lewis? Then you can have sliced ham. Didn't Judas look like Roman Polanski though? Oh, look, Monica Belucci is in floods of tears. Don't know why, she went through worse during 'Irreversible'. She even had a running commentary going on in her ear. A sort of director's commentary, if you will. In this film, Jesus does the commentary.People were eating a lot before the film began, which worried me. I didn't want to get some barf down my neck. I was worried enough through that Anna Friel advert. I have to say, though, that the much vaunted violence was mostly hype. I watched the film without flinching. It was tasteful, almost chocolate boxy. Did anyone else giggle when that Jewish guy reluctantly 'volunteered' to help Jesus with his cross? He almost dropped it on him. As if the poor chap hadn't had enough punishment for one day. The only bit that made me react was the Roman telling his men to turn Jesus face down after being nailed to the cross. Steady on, chaps, that's a bit strong, I thought. Ironically, it was the only time Jesus didn't end up face down in the dirt. Thank heavens for small mercies, eh? Slam dancers and stage divers of the punk era will admire Jesus's technique throughout.I didn't find the film anti-Semitic. It was even handed to the point of political correctness. It was dare I say, even pro-Jewish. There's a saying, which I can't quite remember: Get three Jews together and you'll have five different opinions (or something). I think the film puts that over well. If anything, it could be construed as pro-Israel, as the average Jew certainly needed to get some protection, baby, instead of being the world's whipping boy.I walked out of this film smiling. Very little impact emotionally, or otherwise. Ironically, 'Life Of Brian' comes across as far more disingenuous that 'Passion', as it claimed not to be about Jesus at all.

Already I was annoyed with The Passion of The Christ. After walking up and down the rows looking for a decent seat in the dark for about five minutes, I absent-mindedly blurted out a frustrated JEEZUS CHRIST! An uncomfortable silence followed. Heads turned. Dirty looks were given. I finally realized what I had done and let out a hearty laugh. Another great moment for my memoirs, but also the moment that I realized I was in the wrong movie, surrounded by the wrong people.Mel Gibson's The Passion of The Christ, which was formerly The Passion of Christ and before that The Passion, was made for a very specific audience, the kind of audience that lives and breathes Jesus of Nazareth all day, every day. The kind of people whom have memorized the Bible. The kind of people that still take offense in this day and age whenever an innocent bystander takes The Lord's name in vain. I do not come from that kind of people, and yet, I had still paid for a ticket for this movie. Why? Because I had heard it was the most violent film ever made. My desensitization to movie violence needed a new challenge, and so I went.By the time I had finally made it to see this film, however, my need for gratuitous bloodshed was fading and I walked into the theatre wanting to know more about Jesus Christ. I have not read the Bible and was yearning to learn something from this movie. But instead of two hours of education on the life of Jesus and his beliefs, my Friday night consisted of watching two hours of footage of actor Jim Cavaziel getting whipped and falling down in the dirt. Here's a synopsis of the film: Jesus of Nazareth (Cavaziel) is betrayed by Judas for thirty pieces of silver. He's beaten, whipped, and torn apart. Then he's forced to march to his crucifixtion, carrying his own cross. Jesus stumbles for five minutes, he falls down in the dirt, he gets whipped, he gets back up and the cycle begins again. This goes on for an hour. Thirty minutes of this film is Jesus falling down in slow motion. Then he's crucified.Is this film violent? Yes. Should it have been rated NC-17? Yes. Were there little kids in the audience who's parents felt it was okay to bring them to this movie because it was about Jesus? Yes, and it makes me sick because I know--I know--that some of those parents are the same people who protest against violence in film and television. It makes me even sicker that the theatre was showing trailers for Disney cartoons before the movie started. Let's soften the kids up before unleashing two hours of senseless violence upon them. Great marketing scheme.Gibson, who directed and co-wrote the film, made no attempt to educate. Instead, he set out to depict the last twelve hours of Jesus's life. In this aspect, he succeeds, but as a storyteller or an educator, he fails. Gibson brings in characters without any introduction or indication of who they are. He assumes that everyone already knows what this movie is about. I felt like I had walked into the middle of the story, although, more accurately, I had walked into the end. Short flashbacks of other moments in Jesus's life do little to reveal what he so strongly believed in or why he was punished for the sin of man. What I did learn from this experience is that Jesus was a self-righteous cult leader who died for his beliefs in a time where freedom of thought and religion were not tolerated. Yes, Jesus was a pompous, egotistical cultist. This is by no means a criticism of any religion or anyone's beliefs. It is merely what I observed in this film. Another observation I made was that Mel Gibson has now become the most pretentious man on Earth. Him and Jesus deserve each other.I can't argue that the quality of the film is superb. The cinematography is beautiful, especially in an eerie scene when Judas is attacked by demon-children. It's a truly frightening scene which brought to mind fond memories of The Lord of the Rings. In fact, the highlights of the movie all involve Satan, portrayed by a very androgynous actress who's lines were dubbed over with a male's voice. The film's portrayal of the ultimate evil is exactly what it should be-evil. My body froze over when Satan walked though the crowd, nursing what seemed at first to be a baby.If the Word of God is Watch my son get beaten to death and you will enter Heaven I don't need to be hearing it. This is a horrible movie and shouldn't be viewed by anyone, especially little kids who's parents are too brain dead to realize what they're letting them watch is nothing more than a film documenting gratuitous and realistic torture techniques.GRADE: D or 2 out of 5 stars",2,JEEZUS CHRIST!

You might want to take a look at Dostoevski's tale of The Grand Inquisitor (in his novel The Brothers Karamazov) for another perspective on the idea that human beings cannot live with the idea of God -- that we cannot tolerate it.Mel Gibson's terrific movie presents that horrifying idea in a way that will not be forgotten.

And Controversial films are usually the best ones made. But some of us seem to be talking about just the disturbing gory violent scenes. I pointed out a few details to my boyfriend on the older DVD using freeze frame. He's Christain, I'm Wiccan, We Co-Exist and we like the film.As a film buff, I'd prefer to stick to the story of the film and pay little attention to the disturbing violence (Ex. when Jesus' flesh is ripped, exposing his ribs). And speaking of which, you haven't seen disturbing violence until you have seen another Controversial film, Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs with Dustin Hoffman, which didn't rely on gore.When I saw it in the movie theater on Free Movie Night (College Students Only) in 2006, a friend of mine sat next to me and grabbed my arm. When we were watching the crucifiction and the Roman soldier had to pull Christ's arm out of the socket, I immediately told her to let go.So, living in the bible-belt and going to college there as well, there wasn't a dry eye in the house when the theater let everyone out, except for 4 of us that had walked over from rehearsal for Orpheus Descending.Personally, I still don't think The Passion, while focusing on the last day of the life of Jesus Christ, can compare with the similar retellings like The Greatest Story Ever Told with Max Von Sydow, Jesus of Nazareth with Robert Powell, the equally controversial The Last Temptation Of Christ with Willem Dafoe & Jesus Christ Superstar with Ted Neeley. But, I think The Passion has a place in history as being a film that did touch the hearts and minds of people who believe what they believe in this century.

The problem is, it's just dramatically inert. There's no sort of progression or anything; just wham wham wham the power of christ compels you the end--and the violence is so stylized that even the most basic of visceral reactions is precluded. Further, Jesus in this movie is so obviously an allegory rather than an actual person that it's impossible to feel anything for him. They might as well be beating on a pinata. There's a VERY short snippet from the Sermon on the Mount, and a few other flashbacks, but really, who's fooling whom? These have about the same weight as story segments in a porn film (which this in many ways IS); they're a tedious obligation, and underplayed as much as possible...which may well be a blessing in disguise; while Caviezel is adequate as a meat puppet, he's not so much so when required to actually, you know, act. The only at all sympathetic, interesting, or indeed human character in the film is Pilate (though the scene with the camp King Herod is one of the movie's few truly amusing moments); however, as far as that goes, you'd probably be better off just reading The Master and Margarita.In many ways, the film's anti-semitism is the least of its problems; however, it is there for anyone who cares to see it. Physically, the hook-nosed, beady-eyed, conniving Jewish patriarchs embody every Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion-style stereotype in the book (whereas Jesus and the posse are clearly already Christians, in spite of actually being, you know, Jewish themselves), and while the Roman soldiers may be comically sadistic, the Patriarchs are obviously the primary villains here; the solidiers are just their blunt instruments. It's not necessarily something that's going to leap out at you unless you're really looking to have your prejudices reinforced, but I can see it being pretty unhealthy for anyone on a subliminal level.Granite, there is a fair level of artistry here, even if most of it's wasted. The opening is atmospheric (though that mood is quickly destroyed when the disciples start busting out the mad ninja skillz on the Roman soldiers), and the creepy androgynous Satan is reasonably cool. Also...okay, actually, that's about all. I didn't find the film particularly painful to sit through, but I don't really recommend it either, except in a see what everybody's talking about way.

323,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,310263662,Godly Gadfly,"[24, 80]","This controversial movie about the final hours of Christ's suffering leading up to his death has received rave reviews from many leaders in the general Christian community, who laud it as a very realistic portrayal of Christ's life, and a thoroughly moving experience. Being moved by the images, drama, music, and graphic violence of an R rated movie is different than being moved by the gospel. I want to go on record as a Christian leader who does not share the enthusiasm. The film's producer, Mel Gibson, is a devout Roman Catholic, and as a devout Protestant I cannot share his passion for this project, for several reasons:1. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MESSAGEa) A distorted message.Despite its claims about authenticity and accuracy, The Passion of the Christ does not replicate the gospel accounts, but presents a distorted view of the gospels influenced by Gibson's Roman Catholic background. Gibson has supplemented the Biblical gospel accounts with source material from the diaries of a Catholic mystic (Anne Catherine Emmerich's The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ) This is plainly evident in the prominent portrayal of Mary, and the link between the cross and the altar of the mass - important themes peculiar to Roman Catholic theology. The gospel according to Mel is not the same as the gospel according to Matthew.b) An incomplete message.Secular viewers cannot be expected to understand what they're seeing without a fuller proclamation of the doctrine of sin and salvation. Little wonder that many non-Christian viewers left the theatre confused. Is this any surprise? The Ethiopian eunuch described in Acts 8 had the same reaction when he read about Christ's suffering in Isaiah 53. When asked Do you understand what you are reading? he answered How can I, unless someone explains it to me? A cinematic version of Christ's suffering is in itself incomplete without the preaching of the gospel and a call to faith. It shows *how* Jesus died, but not *why* He died. Without someone explaining it, is it any wonder that unbelieving viewers do not understand what they are seeing? Instead of leaving the cinema as new converts, many non-Christians left disgusted at the graphic violence (which many attest is worse than they've seen in any secular movies), convinced the movie was more bloody than spiritual, and questioning the credibility of Christians who normally abhor Hollywood's violence.2. A ROMAN CATHOLIC MEDIUMAside from the fact that the movie's doctrinal content is questionable, the whole notion of turning the Bible into film form is seriously suspect. It is not only the message that is influenced by Roman Catholic theology, but also the medium.a) Presenting the gospel in film *can* not be done.A movie about Christ's life inevitably includes significant speculation and fiction, and even the best attempts to be authentic will ultimately be a distortion of the Bible. What makes Christ's suffering unique is that it was accompanied by a sense of God's wrath and curse which sinners deserve. A film might attempt to portray the horror of physical suffering and torture, but it cannot do justice to the spiritual aspect of being cursed by God, which the Bible highlights as the most significant aspect of Christ's suffering. Translating the gospels into film and doing full justice to God's revelation in the Bible is impossible.b) Presenting the gospel in film *may* not be done.Sola Scriptura (by Scripture alone) is a basic Biblical principle defended by Protestant Churches with their roots in the Reformation. It is echoed in many of their confessional documents, such as Lord's Day 35 of the Heidelberg Catechism in connection with the second commandment: God wants His people to be taught not by means of dumb images but by the living preaching of His Word. We should not be wiser than God. The means that the Holy Spirit uses to work and strengthen faith is the reading and preaching of God's Word, along with the sacraments. Translating the Bible narratives about Christ into the visual images of film ultimately suggests an insufficiency in the Word and Sacraments, and at bottom tries to cater to man's natural curiosity and dissatisfaction with the written Word! Christians should not be surprised to find themselves curious about how this film presents Christ's life, since sinful hearts are naturally not content with limiting themselves to God's revelation and His official means of grace. Such fascination is precisely the reason for the appeal of all violations of the second commandment. We must however limit ourselves to the official means of grace that the most wise God has ordained to be the food of our soul: the audible preaching and the visible sacraments.Many Christians who are enthusiastic about this movie may be disappointed at my lack of enthusiasm for a project that purports to honour Christ. But being Biblical is more than just about getting the message right, it's about getting the medium right too. Noble ambitions do not justify the use of methods that are not pleasing to God. It's surprising that Protestants would uncritically accept a movie that in principle is the contemporary equivalent of a Roman Catholic stained glass window, a cinematic image used in addition to the Bible to teach people the gospel. Is the Bible really so deficient that we need this? This is an opportunity to renew a passion for the Word - read and preached - which reveals the living Christ. Ultimately only the Bible must shape my understanding of Christ's suffering, the gospel according to Matthew, not the gospel according to Mel. If you are looking for greater insight into Christ's passion, and if you want your understanding of Jesus Christ to be based on the Bible alone, then my advice is: don't watch the movie, but read the Book! - GODLY GADFLY",1,"Don't watch the movie, but read the Book!",1092787200,"08 18, 2004",-0.0883

Although Christ (Jim Caviezel) is shown to have healing powers, the Jewish leaders see him as a trouble-maker and turn him over to the Roman authorities on contrived charges of treason against Caesar. An oft-told story, it is Gibson's vision to focus on the horrific suffering Christ endured on the day of his crucifixion.Since religion has always been an impassioned issue liable to start wars, the needless controversy surrounding this picture arose before principal shooting had begun. The majority of the film's Jewish characters, caught up in mob mentality, are portrayed as self-righteous and uncaring. The Romans fare worse, with most of them behaving like bloodthirsty boors. Yet, history cannot be rewritten to placate sensitive individuals. If anyone today proclaimed themself a Messiah, would we not condemn him in exactly the same manner?Sadly, the trite screenplay (co-written by Gibson) assumes we know the antagonists' motivation, and barely touches upon Jesus' teachings of love and forgiveness. It chooses instead to glorify the barbaric atrocities of our race in lengthy scenes of blood-drenched torture.As the copper-eyed prophet, the usually engaging Caviezel has little to do but gasp in pain, while the two Marys drift through the draining story in tears. Pontius Pilate is depicted as a reluctant judge and Herod a fop, while the sporadic appearance of a female but deep-voiced Satan seems peculiar and out of place.Gibson also co-produced the film, which was lensed in southern Italy because of its resemblance to ancient Israel. The stained teeth and coarse clothing give the film convincing period detail, but the visuals are drab and without colour. The entire movie is also spoken in the acerbic Aramaic language and accordingly subtitled. This proves to be only mildly distracting -- the rhythmic score and too-frequent sound effects of twittering birds are far more annoying.Like Michael Cimino's infamous Heaven's Gate, The Passion of the Christ will prove to be Gibson's artistic folly. It lacks the beauty and marvel of past biblical epics, offering no entertainment or educational value. Further, there are far too many slow-motion sequences that merely accentuate the slow-moving narrative. If those opposed would simply ignore rather than protest, the film would come and go soon enough. But the curious will carry it for the first few weeks, until interest dies down and this pointless and uninspiring film is laid to rest in a sepulchre. One can only pray there will be no resurrection this time around. Rating: 2 out of 10.",1,Neither entertaining nor educational,1104796800,"01 4, 2005",0.0303
331,A3DXVAI08P00HD,310263662,Greg,"[1, 2]","For me, watching this movie was one of the most painful experiences I have had to endure at the screen. The excesses of blood and gore and violence remind me of the excesses of the medieval period in representing and imitating the 'passion of Christ.'Theologically and historically, the film is quite accurate (in terms of the Gospel accounts) except for the gory detail of the suffering of Christ. Unfortunately the Jews are depicted in quite negative terms, which does not help heal the rift between Judaism and Christianity, caused by centuries of Christian demonising of the Jews for killing God. But the biggest repellant for me is the violence, which seems to suggest we only achieve redemption only through a very bloody human sacrifice to an angry God; something which doesn't seem in accordance with much of the theology I know.While there is no 'easy Jesus' or 'cheap grace', I believe Gibson has gone way overboard in this film with the blood and gore, which tends to obscure rather than show the love of God shown through the sacrifice of Christ. Indeed, Jesus seems to be in so much pain for half of the time it hardly seems like divine love or the Father's will is on his mind, but sheer agony from the extreme torture.This film is certainly to be avoided for younger children and adults, and anyone watching it should be warned.",3,Overly violent recounting of the passion,1163635200,"11 16, 2006",-0.5362
332,A2YNJCI2BNF79U,310263662,Gregory A. Beamer Cowboy,"[3, 3]","It take a lot of guts to make a movie about Jesus. Even more to show graphic detail. And, even more to release it in dead and largely dead languages. But, guts does not make a good movie by itself. Amid all the controversy, there are doubtless people with many positions and emotions, some of which are likely to be incorrect.The film starts in the garden of Gethsemane. All events prior to this point are shown in flashback. Jesus is beaten, scourged and crucified, in graphic detail. I will address different issues:Anti-Semitic: Caiaphas, overall, is not highly sympathetic. He does have a moment or two, but he is largely the one calling for the deed to be finished. The crowds cry out for Jesus' death. But, there are priests that leave the trial of Jesus in protest. There are also sympathetic crowds as Jesus winds down the Via Dolorosa. I do not see it as anti-Semitic, and, IMO, anyone who uses this film to excuse anti-Semitic behavior is an idiot.Romans: I see that Pilate, overall, is a bit too soft to be based on the historical Pilate. He is also conflicted. Overall, the Romans are brutal. I would consider most of this material historically accurate, with some embellishment of details. The Romans are given a far worse hand than the Jews. I wish I saw more conflict in Pilate.Graphic nature: When the flail gets caught during the scourging, it is agonizing to watch. The beating is merciless. The film cuts away during much of the beating, or focus on the face of Christ. I saw it as less violent than I was prepared for, while a friend saw it as worse. It is not a child's movie. I am church going; he is agnostic. It is most likely my feelings about what was going on, as part of my faith, made me wish it was worse so I could truly understand.Original Languages: I am a bit conflicted on this in many levels. First, it was Latin and Aramaic from the English translations. Having taken Latin in high school, I did catch one spot where the English subtitles did not convey the full thought of the Latin. I am not good enough to find others, just the one. I would like to see this film again when I can turn off the subtitles and just watch from a pure spectator position.I am glad that the crucifixion is intercut with the Last Supper. It softens some of the pure violence displayed. You will also notice the stations of the cross, if you have ever been around Catholic doctrine. There are other flashbacks that offer a bit of relief from the story being displayed.The Cinematography is great, as is the acting. The cinematographic style reminds me of a cross between Daviau (Color Purple) and Mathieson (Gladiator). The colors are striking in some scenes and you also get the hyper-reality in others. You forget you are watching a film at times. The fact that the actors are not well known faces may help a lot here.I have two images etched in my mind. The first is Christ saying Look, mother, I make all things new. The second is His face when right after he states It is accomplished.Will you like this film? Depends on a lot of things. Christians will likely laud the film, especially Evangelicals. The rest of the world will likely find the film very disturbing and perhaps a bit too violent (as my friend did). It is a harsh film. I think it is rather haunting, whether you are a Christian or not, as it deeply illustrates man's inhumanity to man.The most eerie thing about the film is the complete silence, with the exception of some weeping, when the movie ends. I did not hear anyone speaking until I got out to the parking lot. That, in and of itself, is very powerful.

So that we can go to heaven and live in eternal bliss forever. So, the blood level was high because that's what really happened.

But I emphasize the initial point ; inner passion and outer passion.In this sense the outer passion runs before your eyes and literally catchs you without no mercy . But beware with the inner passion ; isn't equally important to suggest it?Because if you don't, the balance falls in one extreme and doesn't keep the demanded sense of the passion conceived as a whole process.The outer passion is brilliant depicted , the overlong cruelty of the images is absolutely unobjectable ; but there are however five aspects which deserve be mentioned.The apex sequence of the film is about the devolution of the thirty silver coins.

In this fact, the death of the hero must offer us an extreme sense of universal earthquake, uncomfortable loss of majesty. cosmical sadness, and a great background of failure mythical inmersed in a ravishing sensation, all the universe must scream, and I emphasize this aspect because the tragedy is a fundamental piece of the universe.

Christianity has for two millenia treated Jews as responsible for the crucifixion, and utterly rejected Jesus' commandments to Love Thy God with all thy heart, and Love Thy Neigbhour, as well as other important commandments to not embrace Mammon, and not Exalt themselves. The history of Christianity is a history of Hate Thy Neighbour especially the Jewish Ones, and follow Mammon at all costs including the colonization of other nations, the slavery, exploitation and even genocide of their people (eg. the millions of Natives killed in the Americas).How does Gibson's film feed the anti-Jesus practices of Christianity? It focuses on the Church's teachings that Jesus' suffering 'paid' for humanity's sins, so that those who 'believe' in him are 'saved', whereas those who do not, especially the Jews, go to hell. Simply put, Jesus never said or encouraged such absurd notions. On the contrary, he specifically said 'I come NOT to save the world...'. and his parable of the Pharisee and the tax-collector specifically contradicts the arrogance of Christians who imagine they are already 'saved' because they believe in him as the 'universal' Saviour, when he himself contradicted these notions.By focussing morbidly on the beatings, torture, and crucifixion of Jesus, carried out by sadistic Romans, not Jewish priests (who simply wanted him dead), Gibson encourages precisely the wrong teachings of the Church, which Jesus' own statements deny and contradict. No doubt it is based on a sincere effort by Gibson to portray what he has been taught, but those teachings are a distortion of what Jesus himself said.

My long suspicion is that mercy is an aristocratic value. Christianity appeals to this aristocracy of the spirit, which is often a gentler spirit. No wonder that many original Christians and early Christian martyrs were women. You don't need to be a Christian to feel for Christ's suffering so graphically (perhaps too graphically) depicted in the film. It is violent, not hiding behind pretense. It will be disapproved by the modern Western progressives who believe that the human kind is inherently good. They think only a bad governance or dictators (like Hitler or Stalin) make it bad. Actually, Christ's radical message was the reverse. The human nature is seriously tinted. Special effort is needed to make us love one-another -- not somebody of the same tribe or family - that would be easy, but the enemy. How is it even possible? We are to love all men in spite of the fact they are sinners partially because we know we are sinners ourselves. This message is radically different from the organized systems of self-righteousness embodied in nationalism, religious camps, and political parties. They would not hesitate to crucify Christ again. Christianity never ceased challenging human illusions. The best of it preaches religion of the spirit, other-worldly, preaching charity and humility, trusting Providence and submitting to it, and setting its heart and its treasure in heaven. Whereas other heroes may imagine they can liberate the whole humankind, Christ was more concerned with individual human souls. And there is a question of mercy and the state. Seems to me, mercy is an aristocratic value, it is opposite to the self-righteousness and drive for revenge, which are the things of democratic mob. I'm deeply skeptical about the ability of modern state apparatus to understand its enemy, or even the ally, because the state has already rendered judgement as to the purity of its own intentions.

Yes it is well made and well directed, but it reminds me of a really bloody child's tale. Except for the fact that it is so violent, it could easily be a kid's movie. It is so simple; none of the complexities of Jesus' life and statements are examined at all. This movie should just be called The Torture of Jesus. Or Jesus got it really, really, really bad. Or Jesus had a lot of blood, want to see it all? Really, think about how SIMPLE this movie was, no ambiguity, no in depth discussion of his teachings and his often (seemingly) contradictory statements. Every statement Jesus makes is non political, and non controversial, except of course for when he says those who brought me to you bear the greater sin. Meaning of course the Jews bear the greater sin. Other than that we get a very dumbed down version of Jesus and his teachings, the wine is my blood, the bread is my flesh, etc. No statements from Jesus regarding how hard it is for rich people to get into heaven (paging Mel Gibson, paging Mel Gibson) or how he thought money lenders were bad etc. Would Jesus really want a movie made about him that focused this exclusively and morbidly on his death? Why not do a movie on the life of Jesus? That is much more important than his death, his teachings, wanderings, etc. But that movie would not sell nearly as many tickets as this movie will and that brings us to the truth about this movie and the crux of the matter. This movie is nothing but an excuse for people to watch someone get tortured and rationalize it as a religious, spiritual experience, a vehicle by which an average person can indulge in sadism and write it off as religious education. There is no way this movie would ever be viewed as anything but a big budget torture flick if Jesus were not the one being tortured. Think about it, is that not the only reason it is o.k. For normal people to enjoy this movie, because it is Jesus getting tortured, not someone else? Do people really like this movie so much because it is so spiritual and religious, or because it is so bloody and sick? Honestly, everyone who is reading this knows I am right even if they do not want to admit it, the main attraction here is not Jesus or Christianity, it is torture and blood. I guarantee that if this movie where mostly about Christ's life, and did not focus almost exclusively on his death it would not be nearly as successful. This movie is nothing but a sadomasochistic experience thinly disguised as a religious experience. I saw this movie with a crowd full of glazed eyed fanatics who looked to me like they were getting of on Jesus' treatment, while convincing themselves they were getting closer to god. Please, if anything this movie was Satanic in its meticulous, detailed, and yes, loving attention to each facet of Jesus' torture. If you like watching suffering, you will love this movie! The official Amozon.com reviewer, the always dependably disingenuous establishment intellectual Jeff Shannon, (do us all a favor and retire, PLEASE!!) review differed only from the rest of the wild eyed Gibson's cult's reviews in its sophistication and veneer of objectivity. Mel Gibson was so brave to make this film, oh we should admire his aplomb, his refusal to bow to convention, his spiritual and intellectual independence, I am getting teary eyed just thinking about his pure motives in making this movie! Give me a break! Gibson is a fanatic with an agenda and the money to finance it. However, this is America and just like everyone else he has the right to make any sort of movie he wants, I am no censor, and do not advocate banning this film. That being said, I do not think Gibson deserves admiration simply for being controversial as our intellectual guru Mr. Shannon seems to think, by that standard the KKK would also deserve admiration. He has a right to make this film, but that does not make him brave, just fanatical. Now on to the most important and dangerous part of this movie, the anti-Semitism. This movie is anti-Semitic, perhaps not as much as advertised, but there are defiantly Jewish stereotypes in here. All the Jews that love Jesus are normal looking and nice, all the ones that do not love Jesus are seedy, ugly, scheming, and scum. And for those who think this movie is not anti-Semitic just read some of the reviews written by anti-Semites praising this movie and then tell me I am wrong. Gibson's father has stated that the Holocaust never happened and Gibson supports that statement of his father's. There is nothing intellectually challenging about this movie at all, Jesus got horribly tortured, the Jews were responsible, enjoy the torture while faking disgust, then blame the Jews for everything. Pretty convenient for viewers huh? They do not have to think, they get to be entertained and indulge their unspeakable desires, then get to turn around and blame it all on someone else, thereby displacing the guilt you feel for enjoying this film in the first place.Rich fanatical Christians are buying up blocks of tickets and giving them away for free!!! What other movie in history has had people do that. That alone shows that this movie has a serious agenda. The characters in this movie lack depth and so does the film itself. I guarantee that this movie will become a cult hit for anti-Semites and religious nuts just like Gibson himself.

Now, I feel ready to write....MAJOR PERFORMANCES: I think that Jim Caviezel did a pretty fine job as Jesus. He made the torture and suffering of Christ come to life...conveying the point across as best as he could. Of course, he had the strongest performance in the film. However, Mary's (the mother) performance cannot be overlooked. She did a good job of showing a mother's love for her son....and she brings the human side of Jesus to the fore. Others in the film also put in outstanding performances....showing the great political and social upheaval of that period. The Romans were depicted as people occupying a territory that they didn't really care about. Gibson chose to show the old Roman glory through Pilate...and the coming decadence (and eventual downfall of the Empire) through Herod. Whether this is historically accurate could be questioned. The high priests of the Jewish temple were rightly depicted (in how they acted and their fear/power struggle with Jesus and the disciples)....even though I could see some lending to anti-semitic feeling through their dress and how they were shown as power-hungry political types. There is a fine line being drawn...it is easy to cross at times....and Gibson tends to straddle it at times throughout the film where it concerns the Jews.THOUGHTS: Yes, this movie was rather a bloody one. Yes, some of the scenes (such as the cross being dropped so many different times) are a bit overdrawn at times. Yes, the supernatural bits (the wolf-thing visiting Judas) were a bit confusing. However, Gibson has intention in this. If he made a sugar-coated movie, then no one would talk about it. His whole intention with this film was to show how Jesus died for our sins in such a horrific way as to make people stop in their tracks and start questioning their beliefs and faith. To me, if people walked out of the theater and asked at least one question about spirituality, faith, Christianity, Jesus, etc., then Gibson's goal was realized. And, in that, wasn't this movie ultimately successful? I think this movie is the closest thing to the real suffering that Christ endured, and I think it will be a long time for it is matched....if ever.I highly recommend this movie to everyone. However, I would warn people that if they are sensitive to horrific situations, or if they are mulling over questions concerning Jesus in their spiritual life....make sure to bring some tissues and be prepared for a lot of thought and introspection after the lights come back on. If I was a parent, I would not bring my child to this movie unless they were prepared to handle it. Otherwise, for a believer or one questioning their beliefs, it is not just a movie...but an experience.

Speaking Arabic helped me understand almost 80% of the Aramaic dialogue, which sounded eerily familiar and haunting. To me, the movie was mostly about the perennial ingratitude and denial that humanity never failed to afford the Messengers of God. That specific aspect of the film profoundly moved me for that it was depicted so very vividly, and sadly, accurately.Muslims do not believe in Jesus' crucifixion. They believe that he ascended to Heaven in his earthly form before his alleged capture. His betrayer, Judas, was then transformed by God to look like Jesus. Judas (looking like Jesus) was captured and crucified and in turn purifying his soul from the mortal sin of betrayal. Muslims believe in Jesus' miraculous birth yet they don't believe in his divinity, which is one of the major differences between Islam and Christianity.Having said that, the crucifixion scenes were still excruciating and barely bearable to watch. The very fact that human beings were ever capable of devising something so barbaric and inhuman like the crucifixion mechanism or the flogging tools is so unfathomable to me. It's ironic to say that we've come a long way in a time where innocent blood is still getting shed in the most gruesome ways in the name of God.The arrogance and defiance of the High Priests in the film and their determination to eliminate Jesus brought so many allegations that the movie was anti-Semitic. I disagree. I believe that the High Priests at the time of Jesus were so corrupt and venal that they were enraged and defiant in the face of a man claiming to be God's Prophet and wanting to bring about change. Jesus posed a threat to the way the Priests lead their political and religious lives and to the control they had on the lives of those around them. He was a threat that had to be eliminated. Sounds familiar?What many people fail to understand is that Prophets came in times when the majority of people were in dire situations living lives full of deceit, betrayal, corruption, injustice, debauchery and lack of spirituality. Prophets came to bring people back to God and to show them the way of living a joyful life. Prophets were never greeted with cheers and hugs once they started to spread the message of God. They were all persecuted and tortured in one way or another. It's part of our human history and our failure to believe in God's words. I see the movie as a true testament to the ingratitude of all of humanity, not the Jewish Priests or the Jewish people.One of the most mesmerizing portrayals in this film was that of Satan. He was portrayed as a gender-unspecific, haunting character that is almost as beautiful as it is repulsive. It truly captured the essence of evil: a rotten core engulfed by a layer of deceptive beauty.At a time when so many anti-religion films and programs permeate our cultures, this film brings to the forefront a visual of a historical episode of our defiance toward God and his Prophets. It truly pronounces our collective eternal lack of faith in God. To me, that was very sobering, especially now that God and faith are ridiculed and disparaged on daily basis. I guess we haven't changed that much, have we?I recommend this film to adults of all races, religions and cultural backgrounds. Even if you have a different take on the historical accounts of Jesus' life, the film will open your heart to see history from the perspective of one of the world's great religions. It will also urge you to contemplate on the history of the Messengers of God and on God himself.If there is a time for Jesus' return, it has got to be now. Corrupt politicians, fanatic religious authorities, decadent cultures, alienated religions, and imminent self-destruction are all signs of a time humanity is in desperate need for a savior; a savior that will once and for all put an end to the endless feud between religions and cultures and races and souls; a savior that will deliver humanity from itself to a better world where the name of the game is love and empathy for all.",5,The Passion of the Christ: A Muslim&#65533;s Perspective,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",-0.0156

The sermon on the mount is reduced to one line. And the most important point is missing -- CHRIST CHOSE THE CROSS.

Everything is in Aramaic or Latin, which gives it a kind of authenticity and naturalism that the other movies based in this time period just don't have.What I really liked, however, was the fair portrayal of Pilate. He wasn't the Roman monster everyone likes to make him out to be (for the simple reason that the Romans followed a Pagan religion - there's prejudice for ya). He was rational, yet firm in that he did what he had to do - HIS JOB. Pilate wasn't a Jew, and therefor didn't [care] about Jesus's messiah preachings. It was Pilate's job to govern the people and keep the peace. And because Rome was a Republic at the time, it followed the will of majority - and the majority wanted Jesus dead. So that's what Pilate did. This DOES NOT make Pilate a lemming - he did then what politicians don't do now - what the people want them to do.I highly recommend this film to those who have a fascination with the Roman time period or etymology - or with violence.... and more than plenty of it.

One thing has to be said first : this Passion is based on Saint John's Gospel and I have not been able to read that in any paper or magazine. At the same time the film gives many flashbacks that integrates elements from other moments into the story, for example the Last Supper which is not included in Saint John's Passion. The impersonification of the devil is maybe debatable though Gibson avoids any horns and other antics and uses a young character who looks like a man, though he is a woman, so we learn in the cast of the film, and this character is in a way disquieting because he looks very young, handsome and attractive among people who are definitely berserk in many ways. The great value of this film is that Gibson tries to show what this passion really was : sadistic torture and mass-frenzy manipulated by the strong desire from the High Priest, that is to say the dominating group of a theocratic state or government, to get rid of someone who represented a danger for their power. They are only motivated by political selfish reasons and they manipulate the crowd, the people even, the Romans too, into doing what they want them to do and do not have the courage or the authority to do themselves. This aspect is definitely present in Saint John's Gospel and we cannot say this is antisemitic : this is a criticism of a group of autocratic rulers. The fact that they are Jewish does not change the fact. Criticizing them does not mean that all the Jews are bad and responsible for the crime. What's more, Gibson uses another element that is not present in any Gospel, to know the fact that some members of the Council were against the decision and the procedure, showing that we had a real debate on that issue, though not a democratic debate at all. Gibson is also very moderate on some of the torture and violence because either he does not really show the acts or he avoids some acts that are common place in such a situation. Finally Gibson is trying to show that any society tortures and even kills those they consider as dangers for them and that this happens still today, and even in our own societies, even if torturing is more psychological and economic than physical. The main idea that comes out of this film is that anyone has to fight, to the death if necessary, for what one believes to be true. In other words I will say this film, no matter how gruesome it is and how gruesome it may have been if realism had been the only objective, is a good film, and a film that should be shown to people, particularly young people, who don't seem to know that it is difficult and at times dangerous to defend one's ideas and beliefs.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,The Passion for our beliefs may lead to death,1081382400,"04 8, 2004",-0.0662

But after reading a couple hundred reviews of this DVD, I couldn't resist adding my two cents.I did see the movie when it first came out, and I bought several copies of the DVD for myself and family members because it is truly a transformational piece of artistry and guidance of how to conduct your life for the short time we get to inhabit the planet. Most of the comments I read did not actually deal with the importance of Gibson's contribution to civilization.Jesus was an important contributor to the advancement of civilization because he did something that is so rare in human events. He was willing to die for changing a corrupt world and make it more loving, accepting, and inclusive. Religion has always been a force for good and evil because it is used by those who want to advance their own agenda rather than that of the originator of a particular religion. This is true whether the focus was worshiping fire, water, cows, snakes, a human individual, and many other idols. Humans are different from our fellow apes because we actually try to understand the unknowable of why we are here, and what we should do in guiding us now that we are capable of more than just sitting around a fire cooking the day's catch. Muhammad's words are used as an excuse for jihad by lunatics who kill randomly and wantonly to advance their view of the Koran to kill any nonbelievers. The high priests of the temple of David were threatened by a blasphemer when he pointed out the violation of having money changers in the temple. The high priests in Spain and medieval Europe roasted other blasphemers in violation of the words of the Christ they supposedly worshiped as their God.What Gibson does with his work is to point out that we all have a choice, actually many choices in life, to choose the path of forgiveness and love of our fellow man, regardless of how they have violated any sense of humanity towards our fellow man, or go the way of Rome at the time of Jesus (or Berlin and Moscow in the 30's and 40's). It is really the only thing that makes us different from our ancestors who climbed down from the trees millions of years ago and moved all over the planet. I find it especially telling that those who watch something like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and don't feel a need to write a review about such gratuitous violence can give a one star to a movie which is focused on the horrible suffering of scourging and crucifixion two millennia ago of someone who preached honesty, love, compassion, forgiveness, and inclusiveness when the ruling order of the day was sacrificing goats for signs of divine guidance.This is one of the real classics of movie making. It is not for the faint of heart, because dying for the sins of your fellow man is a rare event. No other major religion is based upon such a selfless individual. It is why it has transformed the world from one of Conan the barbarian and his predecessors and successors to one where we think of something other than ourselves and our selfish human passions. Of course humans being humans, the forces of evil are on the march, as exemplified by the suicide bombings in Israel, Ossetia, New York, Washington, Bali, Kenya, Tanzania, Yemen, Germany, etc.Gibson deserves every dime he was rewarded with for reminding us of the transformational nature of the message of Jesus the Jew to mankind. Whether you think of Jesus as the Christ or not, you cannot find a better advocate for all the principles that we take for granted today in the West, including those on the upper West Side or West Hollywood who have never done anything but shoot their mouths off while hundreds of thousands have given their blood and bodies for mankind. Every time I walk among the thousands of crosses in American cemeteries all over Europe, and especially in places like Normandy, where brave young men gave their lives, not for conquest or commercial gain but so that others could be free, I understand their sacrifice and the appropriateness of marking it with the symbol of what Christ did to inspire all of mankind.

Quite frankly, I have no idea what people were looking at when they wholeheartedly claim this movie has no anti-jewish theme. Here are few I found quite objectionable because the biblical account of Jesus's death has been twisted to place the blame of his cruxifiction solely on the Jews.1)Pontius Pilate tries to save Jesus and is portrayed as the good guy. He is not an objective and ruthless Roman governor, but a man who is interested in the truth of Jesus's teachings. Three separate times, he tries to save Jesus's life. First, when the Pharisees and the Jews bring battered Jesus to him , he actually complains that they beat him even though he is yet to be convicted of guilt. Then, refusing to condemn the man, he sends him to Herod. When Herod sends Jesus back (again not finding him guilty), Pilate again tries to save Jesus by giving the Jews a choice to save him. The Jews, of course, chooses to save Barabas instead. Then the Pilate tries to save Jesus AGAIN by just beating and flogging Jesus, hoping it will quell the Jew's anger, the Jews rejects Pilate pleading that Jesus had suffered enough punishment and should be set free. The Jews, and only the Jews, demands Jesus be cruxified.2)The high ranking Pharisees are seen beating Jesus with their bare hands. This scene was utterly ridiculous because it was an equivalent of a Pope beating a Jew with his bare hands(which may have actually happened few hundred years back). Not only is this scene unbiblical, but historically unlikely. The Pharisees were very picky about who and what they touched. A blasphemer was considered unclean and untouchable, especially by pharisees, and beating Jesus with their bare hands broke their own strict rules.I found it disturbing that few twists of the story were all catered to blaming the Jews.

There are flaws however. First, this movie portrays a very medieval view of Christ. Second, the movie captures several unverifiable myths about the death of Christ. The roles of Pontius Pilate and his wife for instance. The bible tells us some but the movie goes much farther-probably too far. However, to create a reasonably complete story I do not see another choice for the author of the movie. Some have said that the movie is only about the physical suffering of Christ but I personally found this to be much less true than I was led to believe by other reviewers. The emotional torture was greatly apparent to me and also, I believe, to others approaching this movie with an open mind. I personally am a Christian but I was a little disturbed by some things I saw at the theatre. Is this a Christian jerk-off movie/snuff movie? Not in general but it seemed to be for a small minority. Overall, I believe the movie is appropriate if the people watching understand what they are watching for the movie attempts to portray Jesus dying for our sins. But, and this is a big but. No matter how horrible they portray the death of Jesus it just simply cannot be captured on film. Jesus suffered all the suffering of mankind while he was on the cross and there is just no way to show it. The other problem which bothered me was that some, despite the R rating and the extreme violence, thought the movie would help their small children understand what Jesus did for them. This upsets me and shows that the movie has potential for abuse. Overall, this was a superlative effort.

Sure he suffered, no one could deny that after watching the film, but so have millions of normal people. In order to make a good movie about Jesus Christ one must explain WHY he suffered and what the overarching effect of his suffering are, not just show his torture. Gibson fails to do this, focusing only on the pain Christ suffered and not what he did with his life, which is far more important. In addition, his direction is very poor, utilizing obscene amounts of slow-motion that would have seemed gratuitous in a sports movie, let alone an epic. Furthermore, the use of Aramaic and Latin has no real point beyond being pretentious, and the inclusion of Satan is unnecceasary and somehwat off-putting. A decent film, but could have been done better.So far I have only focused on the film itself, as if it was adapted from a gruesome best-seller and not the bible (although one could argue they're one and the same). As to the claims of antisemitism, I must say that the Jews are presented in a very negative light, going to all measures to exact awful justice on Jesus while Pontius Pilot is presented very sympathetically. I would like to say a few things about Jesus and the Jews.1- According to Christianity, Jesus came to earth to die for the sins of mankind. Therefore, blaming the Jews for his death is contradictory.2- If God is all-powerful and all-knowing, then certainly he could have saved Jesus if he wanted to and didn't because Jesus was supposed to die3- Jesus, in the eyes of the Jews, was a heretic, and the Christians have certianly done their fair share of persecuting heretics.Although to be honest not all the Jewish people are portrayed badly, and knowing Mel Gibson and his father (a Holocaust denier), things could have been much worse. However, while I am not Jewish, I am sick and tired of people villifying them for the death of Christ, and there was no need to make Pontius Pilot so pious and the Jewish leaders so megamanical. 5/10",3,Style but no substance,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",-0.458

He confronted accusations of excessive violence and anti-Semitism. In my astronomy paper, I prove that God does not exist. But the Holy Spirit reveals that God does exist. I had a religious experience at age 26. One night, I knelt beside my bed reading the Bible. I thumbed through the New Testament. Understanding poured into me. It was as if God pulled back a veil and allowed me to see the nature of things. The Holy Spirit showed me that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on a cross for our sins and rose from the dead. The room lit up in an unearthly white light. It was an experience similar to the one Paul had on the road to Damascus. Jesus did not speak to me but revealed the essence of the New Testament as ultimate truth. I will never forget it.

376,A24D0DENA8N7GH,310263662,James Sadler,"[20, 32]","From the time word first began to seep out that Mel Gibson was working on this film, controversy began to stir. Rumors had it that the film was anti-Semitic and unbelievably violent. And in what was viewed as sheer lunacy, he was filming it in the languages of the time: Latin and Aramaic. At first I thought Gibson had indeed lost his mind. It sounded as if he were making a pet project that would open and be either ignored or suffer the same fate as The Last Temptation of Christ, a film continually excoriated despite its artistic merits.Yet in the past few months, as more details of the film crept out, I began to wonder if I might not be wrong. After seeing the film and witnessing the response to it, I have to say, I am now a Mel Gibson believer. He's not a madman; he's a genius! And not just for making such a compelling film. No, Gibson is also to be admired for the way he promoted this film and for putting his money where his mouth is as the $30 million film was paid for largely out of his own pocket.And financially the investment has paid off. Despite an R rating, the film took in $117 million over its opening 5 days, and shows no signs of slowing down. Gibson had difficulty finding a distributor, in fact I think a European company ultimately released it. None of the major studios would touch it, thinking they were brilliantly avoiding going down with a ship they thought was entirely driven by Gibson's ego. And, no doubt, many avoided it because of the religious issues. Before the film had even been screened it was already being attacked for anti-Semitism.Now the heads of those same studios are all probably kicking themselves for not taking it. After all, nothing speaks louder in Hollywood than money.As to the film itself, it's not flawless, but it is brilliantly conceived and executed. It is intense from the start as we witness Jesus struggling emotionally with his coming fate, hoping in some way to now have to face the next 12 hours of excruciating pain and torture. In contrast, it closes with a shot of Jesus resurrected and clearly at peace with himself and the world.What passes in the interim is largely faithful to the Bible, although Gibson did take some liberties. For example, there is no mention of Herod's wife in any of the Gospels, yet in the film she asks as her husband's conscience, asking him to not punish or crucify Jesus. Many have taken the film to task for its portrayal of Herod. Here he is presented as a man tortured by the whole event, seeking a way to avoid having to ultimately condemn Christ. I actually found this quite believable, despite historical reports of Herod's cruelty. And even the Gospels make some reference to Herod attempting to avoid the issue and finally washing his hands of it.The scenes of Judas being emotionally tortured by his betrayal of Christ were a little overboard. I do not think it was necessary to show him literally seeing demons to convey the guilt he must have felt.The flogging of Christ is unflinching and horrifying. If you are a Christian and have never thought of Christ as a physically strong individually, this extended sequence will leave you thinking otherwise. And it is followed by the long, tortured march to the hill where he will ultimately be crucified. Yes it is all bloody and awful, but it conveys all the emotion and pain of what was happening in ways that no previous film ever has. In most films about Christ, his crucifixion is almost portrayed as a relatively painless event, no to so here.You feel every nail being driven in to his flesh and can see the agony in his face and entire body throughout. James Caviezel will probably be ignored at Oscar time nest year, but he is deserving for so magnificently portraying every emotion that one subjected to such torture would have to feel.Most touching to me was the plight of Jesus' mother, Mary. I think how all this must have affected her is often glossed over. That maybe watching Jesus being tortured and ultimate killed was somehow tolerable because she knew he was the Messiah. Not so here and surely not so in reality. Mary is tormented and in pain throughout the ordeal, and the film does an excellent job of driving home the point that while he may have been the Son of God, he was also the son of a very real woman.The film has been criticized also for its very pro-Christian view, and clearly Christians are the intended audience. But it might have been worthwhile to have added a few more sequences that explained who and what Christ was. Gibson essentially drops into the end of a story without any real explanation of what has gone before. I know this was his intention, that he did not set out to tell the story of Christ's life, it just might have made it more palpable and understandable to non-Christians had there been a little more background. As a Christian I had no problem with understanding what had brought Jesus to the events depicted in the film, but I can see where a non-Christian might wonder, what is the point of all this?The film is violent. But I find it odd that some of the same critics who admire such films as Platoon and Natural Born Killers, among many others, would criticize this film for its violence. If violence can ever truly lead to good, it certainly is the case with this film.Yes, it is violent, Yes, it is provocative. But, it is truly an excellent film, one that should not be missed.

Actually, upon seeing it, I have to conclude that the actual problem is the fact that all previous films and plays about the Passion have been much too sanitized and nonviolent. Of course, the violence, apart from being historically accurate, is a reflection of the brutalities of the ancient world in general and the ancient Roman Empire in particular. Those liberals who complain about conservatives selectively condemning televised violence are just being silly. There is a world of difference between the careful depiction of violence in movies and the gratuitous violence that pervades modern movies and TV. Conservatives have never objected to the former, only the latter. Those who complain about the discrepancies in the Gospels are being equally silly. Apart from the fact that these discrepances are to be expected between independent eyewitness accounts, they are minor and easily reconciled with each other (much as variant newspaper accounts of the same event in no way negate the factuality of the event).The violence makes it easy to understand elements of the Passion. For instance, the abject brutality of the scourging makes it easy to understand why many of those flagellated died on the spot. It is amazing that our Lord did not die much sooner. Then again, God the Father needed His Son to live long enough to complete His atoning Sacrifice for our sake.Far from being anti-Semitic or otherwise portraying Jews in a unilaterally negative light, it includes portrayal of Jews as the victims of the Roman conquerors. This is shown by the derogatory remarks towards Jews by Pilate (e. g., This stinking province!...This rabble!...), as well as the Roman soldiers (e. g., An impossible people!...Help Him carry the cross--you Jew!).I disagree with those who say that the movie didn't pay attention to His teachings. Apart from the fact that the movie was about His Passion, and not primarily about His entire life and teachings, it does include substantial references to the latter. These include flashbacks to the time of Jesus as a Boy, Jesus following the trade of His father Joseph as a carpenter, the forgiveness of the adulteress, the command to love one's enemies, the command to love one another as He had loved them, Peter's promise never to betray Him, etc.Because He died to take away my sins, the film enabled me to see myself as His tormentor. It was I who was spitting on Him, scourging Him so savagely, making Him carry the Cross, and then nailing Him to it.The film concludes with a good visual portrayal of His Resurrection. The grave clothes stay wrapped together while His resurrected Body passes right through them, and His Body still contains the nail marks of His Passion. A superb film!

Mel Gibson may have walked his own Via Dolorosa to make this film but the result is not only worth it, it's astonishing!This depiction of the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is perhaps one of the most extreme pieces mainstream cinema ever offered to a public audience, though ironically perhaps, this film would probably have caused much less of a stir among our great-grandparents generation than it has among us. There is no compromise here, from the first scene as we descend from the clouds into the garden of Gethsemane the viewer becomes a silent observer at the pivot joint of history and is spared absolutely nothing. This is not a film you watch as much as witness.Much has been made of the level of violence in this film, with one critic going as far as to call it a Theatre of sadomasochism and another calling it The Gospel according to the Marquis De Sade, but modern cinema contains an absurd level of violence, the body count in the average Schwarzenegger movie makes The Passion of the Christ look almost mild by comparison. But what we are accustomed to seeing is violence that has been sanitised for our consumption (or is it delectation?); the truly horrific effect of a bullet or a knife on the human body has been turned into light entertainment or titillation. I can't help but feel concerned that respected critics feel that it's permissible to feed the public a constant diet of gratuitous violence in what amounts to a moral and ethical vacuum, with no effort being made to show its real effect on the victim, the victim's loved ones and even the perpetrator.Likewise charges of anti-Semitism have been made against this film. Well what can I say about that? What once person finds deeply offensive another person may not have a problem with, offense like taste is a most subjective matter and I can only give my opinion. In my opinion, many of the individual Jews portrayed here such as Simon, Veronica and Mary Magdalene serve to give the film its humanity. The mob portrayed while on the surface Jewish, seemed to me on a deeper level to represent a cross section of all humanity rather than focusing on any one particular ethnic group, serving at least in part as a warning of the ability of the mob to override the individual's sense of justice and morality. The overwhelming message being that Jesus willingly gave himself up for the sins of the whole world, which is explicitly stated at the beginning of the film and while a mind already poisoned by hatred and bigotry may take a different meaning, in my opinion I don't feel that The Passion of the Christ is either deliberately or accidentally anti-Semitic.But whatever one may feel about this film, what nobody can deny is that Caleb Deschanel's cinematography is breathtakingly beautiful, the delicate use of colour and texture serve to make this film a deeply tactile experience. The acting performances are universally masterful; the score provides the backdrop to the images while never drawing undue attention to itself and Mel Gibson's direction shows all the depth and subtly of the greatest directors. But really all this is academic; the ultimate test of this film is the reaction of the viewer. I was deeply moved by The Passion of the Christ and for me personally the most affecting parts were the almost peripheral events such as the denial of Peter, the total despair of Judas, the torment of Pilate, the compassion of Veronica and Simon and in the end if a work of art moves the viewer on a deep and personal level, what more can it possibly hope to achieve?",5,A film to stand with the greats,1080777600,"04 1, 2004",-0.0595

I have read many reviews on this movie that are fighting about the nature of His love rather than the Nature of His death. But really, don't they go hand in hand? Who but someone who loves with every fiber of His soul could endure this kind of torture for the salvation of those that he loved? Would I lay down my life for my children? In a heartbeat. Would I endure unimaginable torture to spare them from the very same? Without doubt! Would the pain cause me to waiver? Quite possibly. Would I continue anyway? Beyond question.

I am not Catholic or Jewish, but a Christian and member of a mainstream denomination with an undergraduate degree in history and a professional postgraduate degree.STYLE: I did not see this movie in a cinema, because I live in a small town without a decent cinema, and because I felt this subject made this film better suited to private viewing. Mel Gibson chose good actors and the film was well-filmed. However, its generally Italian cast reminded me in some ways of the Italian biblical pictures of the late 50s and 60s. I found Mel Gibson's use of the vernacular languages of the time very distracting, and an interferance to understanding a basic story that I was familiar with from my childhood. The language was such a problem that my wife and I changed to English narration for the visually impaired, which was a woman reading the dialog in English and describing the scenes. It helped a lot. The major roles were excellent -- Jesus, Mary Magdalene, but I felt the language kept me from really understanding or identifying with them. Pilate, on the other hand, appeared to be channeling Brando in The Godfather. There was not a real attempt at providing any context for people unfamiliar with the story, which was a great lapse, and there were some significant problems. How much violence was there? It was so over the top, that it made Scarface look like Bambi. There was so much blood, and so much torture that it was impossible to believe that anyone could have lived through it to get to the cross. The film was somewhat dark, cramped, and confusing, so it was at first difficult to be sure who anyone was. Finally, there was an enigmatic resurrection scene totally devoid of emotional resonance and seemingly gratuitously grafted onto the first ending. Color and sound quality of the DVD were excellent.SUBSTANCE -- I understand why some people criticized parts of this movie as anti-Semitic, and I understand why some people said it was too Catholic. The character Satan is so enigmatic I will leave him to someone else to explain his part, and there are CGI transformations of children into demons tormenting Judas. I will have to say that Mel Gibson imagined/created one of the most wondrous scenes I have ever seen, that for me summarized the whole dramatic impact of the subject. At the end of the crucifiction, after Jesus surrenders his spirit and dies, an overhead shot pans back and back, receding obviously into the sky. At the sky level, the scene undergoes a CGI transform into a drop of clear liquid, a tear from God, which when it hits the ground triggers the earthquake. As awesome as this was, the resurrection (final scene) was a brief, minimalist anti-climax that was incredibly disappointing to me, and clearly an afterthought. The burial linens suddenly deflate, and an enigmatic (and tastefully nude) Jesus walks out into the light of day.",4,Not for the faint of heart or stomach,1096848000,"10 4, 2004",0.0688

396,A140XH16IKR4B0,310263662,Jean E. Pouliot,"[18, 29]","Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ spurred intense interest in America in the spring of 2004. The DVD version can only continue the phenomenon.Based on the visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich, a German nun of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, The Passion fills in the wide narrative gaps in the gospel accounts of Christ's Passion. Emmerich's visions are believed by the very pious to depict, in excruciating and accurate detail, the agonies of Jesus Christ in his last hours. Gibson has stretched and cut Emmerich's visions -- adding an extreme amount of blood, gore and screaming -- to achieve his final effect. Like it or not, this very affecting movie will either awe you (seemingly the majority of viewers) or dismay and upset you (the minority, including this reviewer).The buzz is that this the most authentic depiction of Christ's Passion ever filmed. Actors speak in Latin and Aramaic -- in Gibson's mind, the languages of the time. Neither does Gibson spare the gory details. Roman scourging is said to have been brutal; Gibson shows us each blood-spattering, flesh-rending blow in agonizing detail. The results are visually arresting, serving up searing mental images that will stay with viewers for a lifetime. (PLEASE do not bring kids under 14 to this movie!) Religious authorities have lauded the film. Entire theaters were reserved for church groups. The Holy Father is said to have uttered (falsely, as it turns out) It is as it was.So what's the problem? The Passion is a movie curiously dislocated in time. It bears more resemblance to 19th century Roman Catholic peasant piety than to that of secular 21st century Protestant America. As a middle-aged Roman Catholic, I recall how nuns exaggerated and fetishized the details of Christ's Passion. Gibson does the same, lovingly embracing the wood of the Cross; caressing the nails; cherishing the scourges; singing praises to the crown of thorns. I am also boggled by the film's historical inaccuracies. Greek, not Latin, was the *lingua franca* of the Mediterranean world. Having Christ chat with Pilate in Latin was silly. The inscription on the Cross is rendered in Latin and Aramaic only, omitting Greek, against the evidence of the gospels. And if scourging was the standard means for weakening execution victims, why was only Jesus scourged? Dramatically, the movie is propelled only by its unrelenting violence. The acting is perfunctory, the costuming bizarre, the make-up unconvincing and the actors' delivery plodding -- as if...as if... they were carefully pronouncing syllables from dead languages.Gibson's theological statements about the redemptive value of Jesus's death are questionable. Did the Father required an extraordinarily brutal death to atone for a brutal humanity? Or did redemption require the living of an obedient life, as noted throughout the New Testament? Gibson's choice tells us more about him than about God.The Passion of Christ doesn't add much to the current filmography about the life of Christ. What it does add is highly dubious and often plain wrong. Used cautiously as a devotional aid, The Passion might help believers to visualize the agony that Christ underwent on our behalf. If asked, though, I'd steer people to the gospels instead",2,A Bloody Mess,1096502400,"09 30, 2004",-0.0318

I never got to see it in theatres- it never came to this country. Perhaps that had an impact- not seeing it on the big screen. But I just couldn't empath with what I saw. To me, it was an interesting portrayal of the death of Jesus by an actor. I think in large part this was due to the lack of the life of Jesus. There were only a few flashbacks to alleviate what we saw on the screen- there was little of his life and who he was. We couldn't see him as a human really- although we certainly saw him as a human in suffering. In order to relate to a character, we also need to see him or her as a human in times of joy. Instead, it was near unmitigated bloodshed and carnage.I was impressed by the suffering Jesus had to go through. It was horrible. But I was moved to tears only once- when Pilate's wife gave burial cloth to Mary. This was a human moment; I saw people interacting with each other. This was missing from the life of Jesus. Or rather, the life of Jesus was missing. It was one long death.I wanted more at the end too. It was definitely a Catholic portrayal, with the focus on the death of Christ rather than the resurrection. (Of course, Protestants tend to err too much in the other direction.) The end was too short, too quick- I don't get to see the wonder of resurrection. But at least there was some resurrection at the end.Also Catholic was the focus on Mary. This helped bring a more human element into the picture, but it was odd how Mary repeatedly became the inspiration for Jesus in His suffering, rather than God being that inspiration. There's not even a hint of that in the text. Also very weird were the bits of demonic elements, looking something like baboons. And seeing a near-naked Jesus at the end is...unsettling.While there have been many claims of anti-Semitism in this movie, I saw no evidence of this. It appeared to be what it was- a bunch of Jews and Romans killing a Jew, who had Jewish family and friends. In fact, it presented far fewer positive portrayals of Romans/Gentiles than do the Gospels. It is unfortunate that the line His blood be upon us and all our children! was stricken out of the subtitles, though kept in the Aramaic- it is a moving line, true to the original text and history. Lest the Gospels are now themselves anti-Semitic...It was enjoyable to hear the original speech. Though we are still not sure if Jesus spoke Greek or Aramaic on a regular basis, it felt like I was getting closer to the feel of what the Lord actually said. And, knowing some Arabic, it was fun to catch the occasional word and phrase that I recognized.I do recommend this movie. It gives a moving portrayal, a different perspective, and a helpful understanding of the actual times and death of Jesus.

No more comfortable crucifixion movie scenes... thank God.The flogging depicted was probably worse than what really happened. As a Shroud of Turin believer, I believe that Jesus was horribly flogged by a flagrum that featured dumb-bell shaped pellets of wood or bone... not a flagrum with sharp metal blades. Christ's entire body was blistered and bleeding, but probably not shredded as it was in this film. It would be hard to believe that anyone would be able to bear a cross... or even WALK... after what this film shows as the scourging.As an artistic depiction, however, the overdone scourging depicts how it must had felt for our savior... the agony.As for whether the film is anti-semitic or not, simply read the account written by the Roman- Jewish historian, Josephus. Josephus writes of a Jewish prophet that came after Christ, who preached the downfall of the Temple. The SANHEDRIN arrested him, and turned him over to the Roman Governor. He was scourged by the Roman Governor and set free... and the angry Sanhedrin wasn't very pleased. A stealth assassin ended up killing this prophet of doom with a stone.Thus, Josephus confirms that the Jewish government of that generation would turn a fellow Jew over to the gentiles, if such a brethern dared to oppose them in any way.As the final closer to this controversy, Jesus said that no man could take his life... only he could lie it down for us. Thus, the Jews didn't kill Jesus... the Romans didn't kill Jesus...

Jesus was betrayed by Judas and handed over to his enemies, who condemn him and sentence him to die. He is brought before Pontus Pilate, who has Jesus bound and flogged. The flogging scenes are some of the most graphic of the movie. Finally, Pontus Pilate agrees to turn Jesus over for Crucifixion.The Crucifixion is one of the most moving and powerful segments of the movie. Seeing Jesus crying and asking God to forgive his captors literally brought tears to my eyes. Jesus also promised salvation to one of the thieves, also crucified, who repented of his sins. Jesus' death was marked by a darkening of the world, and when one of the soldiers was told to pierce Jesus' side to make sure he was dead, blood and water poured from the wound. Jesus was finally taken down from the cross on Good Friday and laid to rest in the tomb, but he was resurrected three days later on Easter Sunday.This is one of the most powerful and awe-inspiring films I've ever seen.

405,ATS1HA5M3EPZ4,310263662,J. Elmquist Moviephile,"[9, 14]","In a powerful rapture of graphic storytelling, Mel Gibson's vision of Christ's last hours on earth is shocking, disturbing and strangely uplifting in some ways. Shot in remote locations that are very similar to the harsh countryside of the supposed location of the crucifixion, the movie looks authentic with just a bit of Hollywood drama.The Passion is a tough movie to watch. It pains you with brutal scenes of torture inflicted on Christ as he is persecuted for his claims of being the King of the Jews and the Son of God. The anti-Semitic allegations really aren't warranted. I mean, c'mon, if he hadn't been accused of being a Blasphemer, then he would not have sacrificed himself. The high priests feared the coming of Jesus because it meant that he could tell the people the truth, truth that they didn't want people to know. They didn't want a mad man to fill the people's heads with fantasy, nor did they want to true son of God to make them realize what was really happening. In short, they would lose their place and stature as religious leaders. THAT is simply human nature. If Christ showed up today I have no doubt many Christians would doubt his authenticity. I don't think God faults us for our weaknesses and fears, so I don't believe in the end the religious leaders would suffer divine persecution.Back to the movie though, it is not just a religious revival of the death of Jesus. It is a story, one that many people already know so a lot of structural detail is left out. Mel Gibson instead focuses on interesting aspects, mostly in flashbacks, that you may not expect, particularly the mother and son relationship between Jesus and Mary. With such heavy influence on Mary and her struggle with watching her son's death, this is definitely a Catholic's perspective (Gibson is a devout Catholic). But there is nothing wrong with this, it adds a very emotional impact. The lack of focus on Mary Magdelan is strange though. The one scene that flashes back to her stoning and Christ rescuing her from that torture is short and actually puts Christ in a heroic light. Once again, nothing wrong with this. It gives him a strong presence as if to say `anything that happens to him happens because he wishes it to happen'. One very good dramatic element is the struggle of Pontius Pilate to not have Christ killed. It is one of the best character conflictions of the story. Pilate tries very hard to keep this man, who may simply be delusional, from being convicted by a very angry crowd. He doesn't want an uprising, but he doesn't want to kill someone out of the crowd's sheer hate. His final decision to release an insane and homicidal criminal is a last ditch effort to avoid the inevitable. Other than displaying beyond human endurance, there isn't much in the way of performance that Jim Caviezel can do. But he still plays the part well where he can. There is an especially good scene with his mother where he is displaying his skills as a carpenter, showing us how he must have spent most of his life making a living. The opening scene in the garden has him begging his father to not have to go through with the sacrifice, a very human reaction. Lucifer stands close by trying to convince him that one man cannot save the entire human race. The action of killing the snake released by Lucifer is extremely symbolic and again puts Christ in a heroes light.The production value of this movie is very good. The cinematography is stark and realistic, but again a bit Hollywood. Being forced to read the translations can be tiring, I think some line did not have to be translated and the point could have been understood. Kudos should be given all around to the actors for learning what they had to of the dead Aramaic language. The CGI effects are very good, blended seamlessly with Jim Caviezel as he is whipped with an array of weapons. It adds a tension building element that makes you cringe and has you telling the purveyors of the beating to stop. One might even question if Christ could have remained conscious throughout the experience, being that he was in human form. But that is potentially a much greater argument. With all the hype that led up to this movie, I expected it to be more graphic. But as an avid movie goer, I didn't find it any worse then some horror movies. But it was more realistic obviously as to what would happen to a man if these atrocities were inflicted on him. Thankfully Mel adds a resurrection scene at the end to lighten the darkness, I wish this scene had been a little longer. I highly recommend the movie, not only as a powerful tragedy, but as an emotional drama that can affect anyone, no matter what religion, if they watch it for what it is; a man who sacrifices himself for the greater good of humanity.",5,A painful story,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",-0.0081

Mel Gibson had done a marvelous job at showing the world what it would've been like for Jesus Christ the day he was crucified. Jesus Christ deserves respect and admiration for what he went through for what he believed in and Mel Gibson has done a fantastic job at showing people how it would've been like.It's an incredible masterpiece that helps to better understand the life and meaning of Jesus Christ. It defiantly helped me better understand all the pain and suffering he went through. Through reading the Gospels and watching The Passion of the Christ, everything came into synch of what He did.Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance was worth an Oscar. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of being Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera; you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. The makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and the passion he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs.

408,A1PNNR3B9H8GTC,310263662,Jeremy Berman,"[9, 13]","Even after the passage of half a year, I still vividly remember my arrival at the screening room where I was to review Mel Gibson's controversial new movie The Passion of the Christ. I was stunned to find a vast majority of the audience staring at the blank screen in stony, nervous silence. Many of these individuals had journeyed to the theater on a chilly Wednesday evening in the hopes of viewing a faith-affirming and reverential retelling of Jesus Christ's final 12 hours on Earth (as recorded in the Gospels). Others can come to determine if the film was as gruesomely violent and virulently anti-Semitic as many critics and religious leaders had proclaimed. Every person in the room was waiting doggedly to be either moved and heartened by Gibson's spiritual ecstasy or revolted by the brutality and prejudice of a cinematic travesty. It was clear to me immediately that I was dealing with a movie so provocative and polarizing that it could frighten and compel an audience of people who had not even seen it yet. Now, with the release of the movie on DVD imminent, I feel it is prudent to reflect on this unique and controversial piece of cinema in a calm and rational manner. You are entitled disagree with some of my opinions (I admit to not being a Christian, but I have tremendous respect for all religions and a strong belief in God), but I beg you to hear me out and reserve any final judgments until you have finished this review.The film I watched was sometimes as beautiful and moving as the devout among us had hoped, but often as harsh and nasty and the cynics in the audience had feared. This is without a doubt one of the most unrelentingly violent movies ever produced, with enough vicious beatings and flowing blood to make The Silence of the Lambs and Natural Born Killers look like Disney films. In the hands of his Roman tormenters, Jesus is chained to a post and whipped with powerful sticks and a cat-of-nine-tails with hooks until almost every inch of his body is covered in cuts and sours. He is spit on, slapped, punched and pummeled more times than any person could hope to count. When Jesus is nailed to the cross near the film's conclusion, the audience gets to see the dull nails obliterate his flesh and hear his bones cracked by the additional beatings of the Roman soldiers. I deeply respect Gibson's desire to portray the suffering Jesus endured in an honest manner, but after a couple of hours such displays of violence come across sickening and gratuitous. I was so desensitized and disheartened by these violent acts that I was unable to find inspiration in Jesus' bravery and perseverance in the face of danger. The abundance of violence also prevented me from gaining a greater understanding of Jesus' philosophy of tolerance, devotion and brotherhood. There is precious little screen time devoted to Jesus' teachings and sermons, and these sequences (usually presented as flashbacks) are often stilted and unconvincing. Still, I should note that many people that I love and respect have found the violence in this film to be appropriate and moving, so perhaps I would have to become a Christian to truly appreciate and understand it.Although the Romans are depicted as Christ's most prominent oppressors, he is also tormented and abused by the prominent rabbi Caiphus and his counsel of high Jewish priests. Since many people are reluctant to see this movie because of the alleged anti-Semitism it contains, I feel I should discuss this issue at length for the benefit of potential DVD buyers. Caiphus is presented as a bloodthirsty and unsympathetic tyrant who demands that Jesus be crucified for having the audacity to claim that he is the Messiah. He turns Jesus over to the Romans without a second thought and later brings an angry throng of Jews before a ridiculously weak-willed Pontius Pilate to loudly demand the death of Jesus. Pilate is deeply conflicted about murdering a man that he can find no series fault with, but he ultimately relents to the will of the high priest and orders Jesus crucified. These cartoonish images of Jewish villainy have led many to dismiss the film as anti-Semitic garbage, and they certainly damage the historical credibility of the movie (however, since Gibson was only concerned about being faithful to the Gospels, which are personal accounts that are not neccessarily as historically consistent or politically correct as some would like, maybe this isn't a fair complaint). However, many historians believe that Caiphus and the other Jewish priests were reluctant to turn Jesus over to the Roman authorities, but did so to prevent Jesus from cultivating a following big enough to bring down the wrath of the hostile Roman Empire on the entire Jewish population. Additionally, Pontius Pilate was, by all accounts, a cruel an inflexible ruler who hardly needed the encouragement or permission of a powerless minority group to execute a troublemaker.Gibson may have exaggerated the wrongdoings of some Jewish individuals, but he also presents several positive and heroic Jewish figures. The character Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus bear his cross when he is too weak to perform the task himself, and movingly risks his own life to defend Christ from further Roman abuse. Other Jews chastise Caiphus for his intolerance towards Jesus and wail with grief when they see Jesus' mangled body being dragged through the streets by the Romans. Ultimately, I don't think this film can be truly described as Anti-Semitic. It presents a wide range of Jewish characters that act in accordance with their personal beliefs and are not representative of the religious group as a whole. Fear of anti-Semitism is not a valid reason to avoid this movie!Thus far, I have primarily focused on the aspects of this film that disturbed me. I must make it clear that The Passion of the Christ is not a film without numerous merits. Gibson is a gifted filmmaker, and many of his visual and dramatic devices are dramatically riveting. I was particularly impressed with the depiction of the devil as a shrouded, voyeuristic woman, the use of a raindrop as the starting point of a stunning earthquake, and a brightly lit resurrection sequence that left much of the audience beaming. The performances are universally superb (particularly the passionate and emotionally vivid turns by Jim Caviezal as Jesus and Maia Morgenstern as the Virgin Mary), and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography perfectly captures the agony and the ecstasy of this momentous tail.I almost regret having to give this movie a star grade. The Passion is simply too complex and polarizing to be accessed so easily. I recommend it to anyone who wishes to gain a greater understanding of Christian history or simply put the controversy surrounding this film into perspective. But it is not for the faint of heart!",3,A Fair and Balanced Look at a Controversial Epic,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",0.018
409,A1IBSQQHGCDUAN,310263662,Jeremy Ulrey Bangyrmfhead,"[4, 8]","Back in 1988, Martin Scorsese suffered through a great deal of controversy due to his fictionalized imaginings of Jesus' human characteristics in The Last Temptation of Christ. Now, sixteen years later, Mel Gibson comes under similar scrutiny, but though it is easy to draw comparisons between the two cases, it's the differences that shed the most light on The Passion of the Christ. First of all, Gibson's take is faithful to the source material in the extreme, which is completely the opposite of what got Scorsese into trouble. The controversy over The Passion... isn't whether it's blasphemous -- I don't think I've heard a single person claim that it is -- but whether the visceral depiction of Christ's sufferings were gratuitous or necessary to get the point across. The purpose of this review is solely to examine this central question, as I believe it's crucial to whether or not this is a great film or merely a good one. Hopefully, by the time I'm done, I'll have elucidated myself with enough detail that you'll be able to tell without seeing the film whether you agree or disagree, and if the latter, whether you would have a contrary opinion of the film's quality as well.First of all, I hold true that - in fact - the mere depiction of Jesus' torture in graphically realistic terms is NOT an end in and of itself. To claim the opposite to me would be to give credence to the type of people who stand outside state capitols hoisting posters of mangled fetuses -- whether you're for or against abortion, in other words, your decision should be based on sound ethical arguments and not how gruesome the surgical procedure itself actually is. Similarly, it would be the utmost of shallowness to base one's faith in Christ in feeling sorry for the guy for the physical pain he went through. This almost seems common sensically obvious once stated as such, but one can never belie the sway a good tear jerker has over the emotions of it's audience. So with the above conjectures laid out, it seems that we must by necessity rule out the value of the film based solely on the historical authenticity of it's depiction. But what else does it have to offer if authenticity will not suffice?Honestly, the authenticity seems to be where Gibson is laying most of his cards, although The Passion... is far from the droll sterility of, say, The Alamo, to use another historically authentic (yet dramatically static) example. Jim Caviezel as Christ does everything you could ask out of him given the demands of the script: he's assertive, secure in his beliefs, and displays a certain kind of humanity, although Gibson's treatment of Christ in this respect demands a different kind of humanity than Scorsese wrought out of Willem Defoe. This Christ is not unsure of his heritage and his mission, only his ability to withstand the physical consequences he will have to endure. And, true to his mission, Gibson certainly puts Caviezal's Christ through the wringer. In fact, even if you're willing to accept that the concept of historic authenticity is riveting in and of it's own right, it's hard not to feel that Gibson may be going a little overboard here. By the time Jesus is finished being put through his scourging, it's already become hard to believe that a human being could withstand as much punishment and continue to live. Even if he'd suddenly been pardoned before the Crucifixion, in other words, it's impossible to believe that a mortal man could have healed from the wounds inflicted during the scourging, and without this dramatic element the journey to the Cross cannot help but be an anti-climax by comparison.Ultimately, I think even the most devout Christians would have to agree that the compelling story of Christ is not by what abuse of the flesh he met his demise, but by what persecution and theological uncertainty he lived his life up until then. Without that there would be no story of Christ to pass down over the millenia, as history reveals that Christ was not by any means unique in the extremes of his physical torment, torture being a fairly commonplace device up until very recent times (and with the sketchy revelations of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, who's to say even now this is the case?). By this measure I'd have to give the nod to Scorsese's film, historically inaccurate or no, as at least it goes to some lengths to try and understand what a born mortal would have to come to grips with given Christ's pedigree.Ultimately, The Passion of the Christ tells us next to nothing about Christ's mission on Earth -- someone who had by some means escaped any previous mention of Christianity would certainly not be able to piece together it's tenets based on what they have to go on here -- which leaves nothing else to judge but the merits of a blow-by-blow orgy of violence against the alleged Messiah. In brief segments, Jesus is shown in flashbacks preaching to his flock, but these segments are short and fragmentary, not so much underlining what it is that Jesus was sacrificing himself for as contrasting the good old days when he was flying underneath the political radar, free from the later tyrannical fallout of the dominant religious groups, and as these scenes in their brevity and the sense of their editing fail to provide the film with a dualistic message, we must once again fall back on the central thesis that historical vivacity is an end in it's own right. Hopefully we have shown in pertinent detail why this cannot be the case.",3,B-,1124409600,"08 19, 2005",0.3069

I'm just mentioning the movies he directed not including the movies he starred in, I could go on forever with those movies. Anyway I have to admit I was blown away on how realistic the Passion was. Everything is accurate right down to the nitty gritty. Sure it is graphic but were talking thousands of years ago, people were ruthless back then. There are no tricks or twists, Mel Gibson keeps it very organized and gets to the point. The music and acting is stunning I give much respect to Jim Caveizel he did a great job along with his mother Mary and Pontius Pilot. At first I was hesitate of the Hebrew subtitles, but Mel Gibson does a great job of keeping the dialogue very simple. Also The strong emotional scenes kind of speaks for itself so I guess you really don't need much dialogue. I am also glad how Mel Gibson basically screwed Hollywood, I mean obviously he wasn't going to win any Academy Awards because of the subject matter not to mention like 80% of Hollywood is Jewish. but since this movie was going to bring an anti-semitic wave which it DIDN'T I might add it couldn't get one academy award, Ridiculous! But it is great to see this master piece gross over 700 Million dollars, he basically shut the academy awards up with that. Besides that, the dvd is great too, although no special features are included which I'm not surprised at either, the movie speaks for itself. I personally would rather have a better quality movie with no special feaures than a 4-disc set with an awful picture. The quality is amazing though. This movie probably is one the highest quality looking movies ever. The sound which is in DTS. 5.1 hebrew aramic surround sound is stunning, all of my speakers get attention.

It is brutal yes but I think Gibson just wanted viewers to feel Jesus' pain that he went through for us. He definetly succeeded in that. The film is also uplifting though during the flashback scenes of Jesus when he's not being brutally whipped. However they don't last that long and cut right back to him being tortured horribly. I'd say the moviemakes the people that whip and torture Jesus look the worse as they actually enjoy whipping and putting him through pain. They are clearly horrible men and do you feel terrible for Jesus for going through this brutal beating for us ? Yes. I mean no one would ever...ever want to go through what he did.James Caviezel brings a great warmth to the role and is his best performance period. When it comes to oscar time he shouldn't just be nominated...he should win. Gibson also does his best direction but the movie wouldn't have been as great if he didn't have such a talented actor playing Jesus. The film is brutal and painful to watch but in between all that it's also uplifting and powerful. It's a very important film and hey someone had to make it.

Film critics immediately attacked Mel Gibson's portrayal of the Jewish people in this film, setting in motion a massive publicity bonfire that fed the flames of the movie's success. Personally, I felt the presentation of the Jewish people was roughly parallel to that of the New Testament account within the Bible (with the exception of the demon kids, and additional punishment to Christ on his way to trial). The controversy surrounding this picture was immense, Hollywood was outraged but helpless to stop the film's release due mainly to the heavy audience pull and box office power of Mel Gibson(who also wrote,directed and starred in the violent smash-hit Braveheart). Movie-goers were intrigued by the growing controversy as well as Gibson's sudden, and intense faith-based statements.

I myself thought it was mostly &quot;realistic,&quot; though of course none of us were there when these things happened (the fact that Jesus lived is beyond debate) and therefore cannot judge if the events are entirely &quot;accurate.&quot; It is certainly is hard to judge this film if one includes religious bias. Technically, the film was very well done and gets bonus points for the Aramaic and Roman dialogues. The details were well-studied and reflective of Palestine under Roman rule. The classes of people were accurately represented. The setting was nearly perfect, because I've been to Jerusalem and cannot tell that the film was shot hundreds of miles away in Italy (perhaps owing to the Roman influence in both places?). The script is extremely close to the words of the Bible, though some parts remained somewhat inconsistent (such as the order of Jesus' words in certain scenarios).On the sentimental side, Gibson should not be judged for his execution, because he wanted it to be accurate. If someone finds fault with his direct approach, then I guess that person is blaming the Bible. Some people were offended that Jesus didn't run for his life, saying that this is entirely unrealistic and unChristian-like. However, the Bible says exactly that: that Jesus had several opportunities to free himself and not even go to Jerusalem in the first place. This is one example of Gibson's steadfastness to the &quot;original&quot; script, and I believe that had he altered things to make them more sensible, the movie would have suffered a lot.On the whole, a movie you'll want to watch just out of curiosity.

Regardless of your religious preferences, you should see this movie. Gibson relates the 12 hours leading to the death of Christ in a series of flashbacks, beatings, and stunning cinematography. His choice of doing this movie in Latin and Aramaic was correct; it would not be nearly as powerful if performed in English. Jim Clavizel has little match with the intensity that his eyes convey. Gibson also adds nuances and flourishes to the story (the Satan character and the demons that hound Judas) that add so much to this movie.A lot has been written concerning the anti-semitism this movie conveys, and I'd strongly recommend that you see the movie and reserve your opinions on that until you've actually seen the movie. I don't really blame the Jews for the crucifiction, and I think Gibson utilizes the mob as a tool of Satan, and that really shows in the movie. Also, the gore is definitely present, and you should not see this if you have a weak stomach. However, it is dispersed throughout the movie, and after that first horrible whipping, you don't notice it as much. I definitely think that everyone should see this once.

I was ready to settle in for some trailers, but there were none. The film started precisely on schedule, and I was already taken aback by the sudden commencement of the film. I wasn't sure how to prepare myself. I knew that I was going to witness disturbing frames of film, but the result was more than I can say. Simply put it, The Passion of the Christ is an experience that cannot be described in words, but only in the art form that Mel Gibson has created to express a feeling like no other. In this review, I will rave about the film being the best ever. Why? Because it is.The Passion, as most call it in short, is not only Mel Gibson's finest work (he had previously directed Bravehart and The Man Without a Face, two fabulous films) but it is the most triumphant motion picture ever to hit the big screen. What we see here is a film with a direct focus that has the ability to create an emotion that is completely indescribable. The focus is on the title, which Gibson uses as the centerpiece of what his film is truly about, and that is the willpower of Jesus Christ, the love and the passion that resided in his body to carry on through the worst possible human torture that anyone has ever endured in history. The only way to really feel that and to express that theme is to show the graphic violence that was depicted by several amazing special effects artists whom worked on this film. On film, it was no longer make-up or special effects; it was real, completely real. Exaggerated? Yes, of course, that's how a theme is drawn out. Although it was the most violent picture I have ever seen in my life, it was made that way to complete this theme of passion. The actual passion is what Jesus had to endure, and had the film been shown any other way that passion could never be conveyed.Every frame of Gibson's work is a concentrated art and has pure perfectionism written all over it. Much of the great visual aspects of the film can be credited to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, an artist whose work has been nominated several times for Oscars on films such as The Natural and The Patriot. To further Mel's perfectionism, he relied on production designer Francisco Frigeri and costume designer Maurizio Millenotti to create the very accurate period look to the film. The frighteningly realistic makeup and special-effects were done by Greg Cannom and Renato Agostini, two artists who have now excelled to the most supreme level of movie magic. I also appreciated John Debney's score that was fluent throughout the entire film. As a matter of fact, I can't think of any moments in the film that did not have music playing. It was a really great way to enhance a story that was foreign to our ears and depended on subtitles to convey the literal text of the film. Debney really found his own way of telling a story through music, keeping the audience entrenched in the world Mel Gibson has set us in.And finally, the acting was brutally realistic. Jim Caviezel had the incredibly difficult task of bringing the most beloved figure in history to the screen, Jesus Christ. His performance is worthy of more than an Oscar, but it should be considered one of the top five best performances in the history of film. Rosalinda Celentano had the task of bringing histories most despised figure to screen, Satan. She was not just some creepy figure that made the film scary, but she had a distinct purpose in being the obstacle in Jesus' life. Her constant interference was used to tempt Jesus down a path that would eliminate all passion and glory. I really liked the use of her eyes. It created a distinct look that when she stared at the camera, you felt the intimidation that Jesus was feeling, and the provocation that Jesus felt when she smiled at him. In Gibson's visual style, this would be credited as the motif for the temptation towards Christ. Monica Bellucci played the beautiful Mary Magdalene, a lover of Jesus. She did her job creating emotion alongside another performer whom swept me away, Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Mother of God. What an amazing job she did in creating the passion of a loving mother. Absolutely stunning. Makeup, effects, and costume do a lot to enhance a character, but performance is what makes them real.As a film reviewer, it's not my job to do what I really don't want to do, and that is touch upon the controversy. Before viewing the film I promised myself I wouldn't, but it now seems necessary because I have a few things that need to be cleared up. Anti-Semitic my ass. This film spills the truth. This is what happened in the Bible, this is what the Christian society believes, and this is how it MUST be told. Any other way would disgrace and insult the passages that we know in the Great Book itself. And let me explain how it all works. Did the Jews kill Christ? Yes. Was Jesus Jewish himself? Yes. Oh, and there was another Jewish man who came along to help Christ carry the Cross. In addition, Jesus' Jewish family and friends were on his side. So really, what can we compare this to? Well, if we would all like to use our precious brains that God gave us for just once without trying to stand on some large mountain and get attention by protesting these issues, just think Civil War. Essentially, that's all this is. It is a community of Jewish people all hurting each other. Some are on the good side, Jesus' side; others are on the bad side, Caiphas' side. So why all of a sudden is it Mel Gibson demising a Jewish community whom are all in a conflict? What if he made a picture about the Civil War? Would he be insulting Americans, saying that Americans killed, well, Americans? Honestly, let's think of the circumstances. No matter what group of people you put in there they will all be considered as being demised by Gibson for killing Christ. The fact that it is Jews in the Bible makes it no more than a Civil War, and if we have to cry out and say that that's anti-Semitic, well then we have more issues than I realized, and I only hope there's enough tissues to go around and collect all the tears from these crybabies who are protesting. And that's all I have to say about that.Bottom line, it's not just any great film to see, but far beyond. It is a great experience to go through and to feel. Any person that comes out of this movie saying it wasn't a great experience must be a heartless and cold being with no feeling of remorse for anyone. I hope everyone will see this film and understand what one man went through and the passion he had to carry on with it further than any human could ever possibly tolerate, regardless of their religious beliefs.

We are rating a movie here not the actual religion. So please stop the fighting.Although I'm not a Christian, I have great respect of Jesus Christ as a great prophet of God, messiah and a teacher. I love biblical stories, especially the stories of Moses and Jesus. But this wasn't what I was looking for; the scenes with the Virgin Mary were perfectly done, and emotional. But the movie drags on with the physical torture of Jesus. Almost 99.9% of the film is comprised of torture and beating of Jesus, which I found genuinely distasteful. What I would have liked to see is more about the teaching of Jesus, and why the Jews were so fixated on eliminating him from the scene.In conclusion, if your not a Christian then I don't see how you will relate to this movie, but if you believe in Jesus the messiah as a redeemer and his suffering led to the salvation of the human race, then this is totally the movie to buy.",2,FOR CHRISTIANS ONLY,1110672000,"03 13, 2005",-0.0314

428,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,310263662,Joe Sherry,"[8, 13]","A film by Mel GibsonThe Passion of the Christ focuses on the last hours of the life of Jesus of Nazareth (Jim Caviezel). The film begins in the Garden of Getheseme where Jesus is betrayed by Judas for thirty pieces of silver. It ends with the crucifixion at Calvary. The bulk of the film is what happens in between Getheseme and Calvary and it focuses on Jesus' suffering. This is what sets The Passion of the Christ apart from every other film made about the life of Jesus. Many deal with the life of Christ, and others with his teaching. The Passion of the Christ deals with one very short, and particular, period in his life: those last hours, the Passion. The American Heritage Dictionary includes as one of the definitions of passion as The sufferings of Jesus in the period following the Last Supper and including the Crucifixion, as related in the New Testament, and that is exactly what this film is about. This is Mel Gibson showing us what Jesus went through and at times I could almost hear Gibson saying This. He went through this for us.While The Passion of the Christ is a very brutal movie, and perhaps half of the film features in some way the beating that Jesus took on the way to Calvary, it isn't the violence that has stuck with me after the movie ended. What I found particularly memorable were some of the smaller moments: the flashbacks that showed Jesus with his mother (Maia Morgenstern), Jesus teaching, Jesus with the apostles. Just as memorable, though, were the moments of betrayal: the look between Peter (Francesco De Vito) and Jesus after Peter denied Jesus for the third time, Mary (the mother) and Mary Magdalene (Monica Bellucci) together weeping at the torture Jesus is suffering, and any time we saw Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) moving through the crowd, or tempting Jesus. Lastly, Mel Gibson's handling of the Resurrection was particularly moving. It is a mix between beautiful and simply powerful moments that allow this movie to rise far above what could otherwise be called (and has been) nothing more than two hours of Jesus being beaten.What makes reviewing this movie a challenge is that it is very difficult to separate the story from the filmmaking. As a Christian, the story is one that is very familiar to me and is also one that I personally believe in. As a reviewer, I have questions about Mel Gibson's storytelling. If I knew nothing about Jesus of Nazareth and was not familiar with the story of Easter Week, would I understand what is happening in The Passion of the Christ? The film lets us know that this is a man named Jesus who is being persecuted, that it is the Jewish Pharisees of Jerusalem which have brought charges against Jesus to the Romans, and they feel that he is blaspheming God. For this they wish Jesus to be put to death. What the film does not go into is why. Are these Jewish leaders just blood thirsty? Are they threatened by Jesus' teaching? Is there a serious law that he has, in fact, broken? Why are they pushing so hard for his death? The Passion of the Christ does not answer these questions. Someone who does not know the story of Jesus may not know why he is being brutalized to this extent and what promises Jesus' life and death, and resurrection bring.Viewing the film from my perspective, the lack of that detail being in the film did not affect what I think of it. The Passion of the Christ is a bold, moving, powerful film and the fact that the subject of the film is so central to what I believe only makes it more so. I cannot speak to what a non-Christian would feel about The Passion of the Christ because an emotional response is so personal and subjective, and that emotional response is exactly what The Passion of the Christ taps in to. The combination of how skillfully Mel Gibson has crafted his film (excepting that little issue with exposition) and the emotional response that it encourages, this is arguably one of the best films of the year so far and may very well be a contender for Best Picture come Oscar Season.The one criticism that I would like to address here is the charge, of some, of anti-Semitism. It is one that I do not understand. At the beginning of the film, when Satan is tempting Jesus, Satan mentions that carrying the full burden of sin is too much for one man. The suggestion is that Jesus (and therefore God) is choosing to do this, and that Jesus knows what is coming. In fact, Jesus says as much in the flashbacks throughout the movie. Moreover, while it is true that it is the Jews who turn Jesus over to the Romans, there were some Jews who spoke up against their leadership saying this was wrong. It was also only in the power of the Romans to condemn Jesus to be crucified and the film shows Pilate symbolically wash his hands of the whole affair, which was a cop-out. Pilate made the decision. It is also the Romans who are brutally whipping Jesus as punishment before he is to take up his cross. The implication here is not that the Jews nor the Romans who are specifically guilty, but rather: All are guilty. All. With Gibson's hand being the one that drives the nail into Jesus, he includes himself in the all.-Joe Sherry",5,impossible to separate story from the filmmaking,1094515200,"09 7, 2004",-0.0314

I weep to think that this would happen to the most guilty of men let alone a good man who's done nothing to deserve it. And though I am not a Christian I respect the story of Jesus. But, this is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen portraying his life.99% of the story, the dialog, and the violence is not an accurate portrayal. It's not just that most of the story is made up or isn't accurate according to the Bible, but most of the dialog is made up too. Most of what is supposed to be from the Gospels is altered in some way to say something other that what scripture says.The violence in itself is another story. Though it is told that Jesus was tortured and suffered, the violence depicted in the movie just isn't realistic. It's not just that 99% of it isn't mentioned in the Bible, but there is no way on Earth that Jesus could have survived 20 minutes into the movie. If he hadn't bled to death first, the fishhook type whips used on him would not only have ripped his flesh off his body, but gone in and ripped out his internal organs too. It's just not realistic. No one could have survived that. Not even the Son of God.The portrayal of the Roman soldiers that beat Jesus wasn't realistic either. I know that the Roman soldiers were cruel and could be sadistic but the way they are portrayed in this film is as much over the top as all the violence. The Bible mentions nothing of all this punishment. He wasn't beaten and whipped and kicked around the way they showed as he carried his cross to Calvary. He fell three (3) times. And most of the portrayal that went on with him being nailed to the cross and set up isn't mentioned at all. Him being flipped over the way he was. Geez!What this movie blatantly is, is an attempt to play on the emotions of those who believe so deeply in the story of Jesus. Period. It's false propaganda and it plays its part well. You can tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they'd ever seen. Don't buy into it.Any Christian who is interested in watching a more accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus would be far better off watching Jesus of Nazareth. Or any non-Christian who's just interested in learning about Jesus' life. The real purpose of Jesus' life is portrayed in Jesus of Nazareth, and done very well. His teachings.

432,A193A7T1E8CUTB,310263662,John F. Frederick,"[411, 465]","One of the most talked about films in decades; thought I would add my 2 cents as a late entry.I think the root controversy about the film has to do with the question of whether or not it has artistic merit for a viewer without faith. I think this is a fair question, as I never really understood the idea that religion offers, so to speak, an excuse for ugly artwork. Arguably there is no such excuse, unless one of the points of religious art is to repel people who don't already share the faith.The film has been labeled violent, which it is; but unfair here has been the label that it is in some noteworthy sense exceptionally violent. It is not. There are hundreds of films that are far more violent--and graphic. Perhaps this film is even less violent than average, at least of more recent decades. It is perhaps even less violent than the blockbuster version of Gandhi of some years back, billing Candice Bergen and Ben Kingsley, of which the Passion has reminded me somewhat; at any rate they are at least in the same ball park. Rather, the distinctive mark of the Passion is that it invites us to keep the humanity of the victim of violence in full view; not to distance ourselves by, say, feeling contempt or anger towards the victim as a bump-off-able bad guy, or seeing the victim as a replaceable curiosity, a dispensable nitwit. In the Gandhi movie, for example, the majority of the acts of violence are against victims who are more or less, cinematically speaking, dispensable nitwits. All we see Gandhi suffer is being shot at the end--and even that, at the beginning also, setting up a flashback--and a few blows to the head (from which he recovers). In any event, it is easy to name films that are more violent, just not ones that, at the same time, are as personal.The character to suffer the violence in this film is not only the main character, it is a character who is anything but a dispensable nitwit. He is unambiguously portrayed as is in the Gospels--a perfect human being--and more: a Divine Person. No doubt faith is helpful here, but if the viewer can so much as entertain the premise as a possibility, then I would say that the movie is as beautiful as it is emotionally powerful. Yet even apart from that premise, the film also powerfully portrays deep love and friendships between human beings, which has surely a beauty of its own even under heart wrenching circumstances. Moreover, in what is surely one of, if not the most violent sequences in the film--the scourging (the soldiers carrying out the order, one in particular, wind up going over the top in enthusiasm)--we only see the victim about half the time; the rest of the time we see shots of peoples' faces, notably his friends, mostly of the face of his mother. The film does show us the anatomical side of the violence enough so that we really understand what is happening--but no more; the point is what it MEANS for it to be happening. In this film suffering is given a human face.It is quite a unique experience. First, breaking out of the package of being mere cinema, there are two points of honesty of the film even apart from any faith claim. (1) by all serious accounts, Jesus of Nazareth was at the least an exceptional human being; yet death by crucifixion was no walk in the park. (2) by all serious reflections, in one way or another--regardless of how you slice it (whether from the point of view of any religion or from the point of view of atheism)--humanity really hasn't treated God any better than the main character gets treated in this film. This is a film which portrays God as staying with humanity despite the way it has treated him (and the way human beings have treated each other). The violence is not for it own sake; still less is it for the sake either of sadism--or of a narrator stepping off the screen to address the audience with guilt trips (shaming and flagellating the viewer)--; it is for the sake of thoughtfully presenting this possibility in an artistic way. Second, rather that allowing the audience the space to distance themselves from characters undergoing violence, this film actually does the opposite: it prods the audience to see NONE of the characters as dispensable nitwits, not even those who are committing the violence. The anti-Semitism charge is simply a non-sequitur. It's not anti-anybody.The film visually portrays what I have described without being artificial or saccharine, invoking a remarkable depth for symbolism and a good sense of timing; it plainly succeeds in telling a story blending sight and sound. I will give two examples which I found especially powerful; they are even related. One is where the film shifts back and forth from shots of the feet of the roman soldiers standing in pools of his blood as they scourge him, to shots of the feet of the Apostles as he was symbolically washing them. The other is a subtle, nonverbal portrayal of the conversion of a roman soldier which spans in a sense the entire film. This conversion story is visually framed from the film's opening scenes when a servant of the High Priest (Malchus), accompanying the cohort sent to arrest Jesus, has his ear miraculously restored after it is sliced off in a struggle by one of the Apostles. Malchus remains for some time on his knees, as if so overcome by the experience he cannot move. The roman solider to be converted (referred to as Cassius) is subtly introduced in the next scenes (he is one of the soldiers Mary Magdalene complains to about the arrest), but we see him from time to time throughout the movie, witnessing and being influenced by various events; in a final scene, blood and water falls upon his eyes, flowing from the side of the deceased victim that he pierces with a lance (though first non-verbally apologizing to the mother; he does it merely to confirm he is dead), and he falls to his knees in a way which resonates with the action of Malchus. Malchus, so to speak, had his hearing restored; the Cassius, so to speak, his sight. (While restoring Malchus' ear, Jesus says that he who lives by the sword, shall die by the sword; in response to Cassius' sword, Jesus, in death, gives life.) On the side of deep friendships, notable are the relationships between Jesus, his mother, Mary Magdalene and the youngest Apostle, John. One moment uniting this dimension to the above examples is when John stumbles and falls on his knees before the two Marys (running to them to tell them of Jesus' arrest)--to be followed by John later seeing Mary's agony as she watches her son fall to his knees as he carries the cross. Another, also depicting the bond between Jesus and his mother, is when Jesus is actually underground (after his arrest), and Mary, intuiting the spot, kneels and puts her ear to the ground (with John and Magdalene watching and moved with understanding). The kneeling image in general is itself also framed by beautiful opening and closing scenes invoking a folding together of earth and sky (the first providing the backdrop of Jesus falling to his knees in his agony in the garden; the second entailing powerful from-the-ground-up and from-the-sky-down shots of the moment of his death on the cross). Here resonating throughout is the film's awesome musical score. I would add that the use of Aramaic in the film punctuated with subtitles was nothing less than masterful; I am not even aware of the film being in a foreign language.Acting was good but special mention needs to go to Maia Morgenstern, who played the mother. In interviews she said she played the character from the point of view of a mother who loved her son; the result is one of the most moving and beautiful character portrayals in all of cinema.If you are looking for popcorn-eating entertainment, this is not the film to watch. (Even during gladiatorial times at the Colosseum this movie would have gotten thumbs down.) But if you are in the mood for a thought-provoking treatment of religious themes in a serious, sensitive and artistic way, then by all means see the film.*Note: This review is not based on the Definitive Edition (or its commentary).",5,'they've seized him',1167091200,"12 26, 2006",-0.029

Hoh Jr. Author and Theologian,"[1, 2]","On Saturday, March 6, 2004, I attended a showing of The Passion of the Christ with a group from Salem Evangelical Lutheran Church. We had decided to make this an evangelism event with a discussion following the movie followed by a chili fellowship. A group of 50 (half guests of Salem) attended the afternoon matinee. Flyers announcing the discussion were distributed and several viewers joined us for the discussion. All in all it was a good afternoon and all involved were able to sort out thoughts and feelings following the watching of this movie.In a word, the movie was breathtaking. Some scenes the audience literally jumps. The theater was quiet-one didn't hear the munching of popcorn!Artistically the movie portrayed the suffering as no one has seen it portrayed before. Many at the discussion admitted that it got to a point where they said to themselves, Enough already! One person even left the movie (but did re-join us for the discussion). My advice is to know yourself. If you feel you cannot handle violence or blood, don't go. If you do desire to see it, consider waiting until the movie is released on video or DVD and rent it-you can always stop the tape if the action becomes too intense.Mr. Gibson remained for the most part close to the Gospels. There are some Catholic add-ons, such as I believe Veronica wiping Jesus' face which is not found in the Gospels but is part of the chronology of the Stations of the Cross. Some thought Mary may have played too prominent a role, but she was the mother of Jesus; what mother wouldn't be there to comfort her child?Amazingly, I was able to understand about half the spoken dialogue (all that Latin, Hebrew, and Aramaic training finally came in handy). The scenes with Pontius Pilate were interesting. Sometimes the dialogue between Pilate and the Jewish leaders was in Latin, other times in Aramaic/Hebrew. I will try to watch it again to try and detect a pattern. The subtitles were somewhat close to the Scriptures. Not knowing what translation of the English Scriptures Mr. Gibson used I cannot verify if the passages were verbatim. I did enjoy the opening scene of a black background with a verse from Isaiah in white text. It set the tone for the movie.There was, indeed, violence. How can there not be when a man is whipped and then crucified? Here the movie did disappoint. Having studied the Roman methods of torture and crucifixion I believe Mel Gibson held back in this area. And this might be the right call. The horrific violence that was on the screen was too much for some. Add to that the fact that the mental and emotional suffering Jesus endured weren't portrayed. (If you can stay awake through it, watch The Last Temptation of Christ and keep in mind throughout that this was a temptation as envisioned by the artist. This might give you a taste of what Jesus endured internally in this suffering.) The scene at the cross was a tad short. Mr. Gibson could have had Jesus pushing himself up gulping for breath just to give the audience a taste of the cruel discomfort on the cross. The arm being pulled did add realism to the effect just before the nail being driven through the right hand.The role of Pilate brings a new dimension for Christians who haven't thought too much about this man whom they name in their confessions. Mel Gibson adds a soliloquy by Pilate on truth where he asserts what he believes to be truth as he sees it. His wife, Claudia (not named in Scripture) does play a more prominent role than she does in Scripture. In the Gospels we are told she sends a messenger to her husband; in Passion she is right there through the trial giving her husband disapproving looks.You will not soon lose the picture of the gleeful Romans whipping Jesus. Again, in our discussion it was pointed out that the Roman culture loved blood.All in all, this is not a movie you will enjoy (even if the ticket taker says, Thank you. Enjoy the movie.). But you will leave thinking about it and pondering it. You will want to talk to someone about it. If you do go to see it, try to go with a group planning to discuss it afterward, or schedule time for reflection afterward. One patron we met took a flyer disappointed she had to go to work.

The Aramaic dialogue lent authenticity and beauty to the scenes. I, personally, did not find the film to convey a message of anti-Semitism.So, why only two stars? Partly because I'm a stickler for a well-written script, and this film not only didn't have one, it hardly required one. But mostly because, though I am not a believer, I have respect for the story, and a desire to see it told well. Gibson's peculiar obsession with violence overwhelms it. Pelikan's Jesus Through the Centuries points out that, while we think of Jesus as being a challenge to dominant cultures, the portrayals of him are often a reflection and an endorsement of the dominant culture. So, in our extravagantly, pornographically violent times, Gibson produces a movie that extracts the most violent 24 hours of Jesus' life and makes it stand in place of the whole story. In an age of religiously-inspired violence, it is a tragic decision for a director to make.Gibson presumes that everyone knows Jesus and is sympathetic toward him. While that may be mostly true, it also lets Gibson off easy, absolving him of the director's difficult role in a tragedy: make the audience care for the characters, tell the audience why these characters are worthy. Instead, he involves us in an orgy of gore, reveling in the blood spilled, and raising the awkward question: If this is the whole purpose of Jesus' life, then what are we to think of the villains, Judas and Pilate, et al, who brought about that which must be done?But Gibson as storyteller/evangelist is not interested in conundrums. I think he wants to make us feel good about feeling so bad. And he fails, at least in my case. I want to be ennobled by this story, as by stories of other selfless teachers who fell to the authorities of their times. I was appalled by the parents who had taken their children to see it. It is, hands down, one of the most graphically violent movies you will ever see, and parents should exercise the same caution with this film as they would with any other portrayal of a death by torture.I knew that it was violent, and graphic, when I went to see it. What I hoped for was that Gibson would try to convey a sense of solidarity between Jesus and others who have been murdered, tortured, or persecuted. That sense was entirely missing. If he had run the quotation - Whatsoever you do to the least of these, you do unto me - toward the end, all of the violence might have been somewhat redeemed by urging us to treat others with the same pathos Gibson wants to evoke in us for Christ. Instead, he gives the resurrection a bare moment at the end, accompanied by military marching music, as if Jesus came back to kick some serious [...] in retribution. I found the film, and its violence, utterly lacking in redemptive value. There is no grace here. I am not surprised that Gibson followed it up with yet another portrayal of human sacrifice, since that is what he reduced this grand story to: a mere barbaric bloodletting.",2,Good news . . . and bad news,1184457600,"07 15, 2007",-0.157

It is also a name for a day which on the surface of it was the antithesis of anything good - the politically motivated murder of an innocent man through envy, ambition, connivance, and betrayal. But Good Friday is, as all Christians know, the day God Incarnate gave his human life to save humanity. So like the seventh day of Creation, it was very good. The Passion of the Christ was the central, seminal, pivotal, event in Western Civilization.I personally have never been able to make it through an entire sitting of this film. It's too horrible, too deeply disturbing, to watch, for me. That said, I've made sure to watch it in sections from start to finish for it truly is a magnificent film, a film that needed to be made. It's a film that stands as a testament against the powers that be today similarly as its subject was a testament against the powers that be. Unlike so many films made today - for example the recent Noah, or the Lord of the Rings films by Peter Jackson - this is not a film that had to mangle its subject to make room for the director's ego. Rather, this film delivers as accurate a portrayal of the Passion of the Christ as this world will likely ever see in cinema. The stories surrounding the making of the film are fascinating in themselves.Why watch this incredibly disturbing film? It's sublime. Schopenhauer's definition of the sublime in Art, as I recall it being described, was of a force too great to be contained by the three-dimensional forms of time and space moving into the present, an aesthetic experience that is beyond moral judgments of right and wrong that touches the spiritual third rail of Creation. Similarly, James Joyce wrote of what he called aesthetic arrest, an aesthetic experience in which one is neither drawn by desire nor repulsed by fear but simply locked into a profound meditative assessment of truth. These ideas are my best approach at answering the question of why to watch this film. There is something cosmic about this film. The miraculousness of the Passion narrative communicates itself through this film. So yes, hard as it is for me to bear watching it, I cannot imagine going through this life without seeing it, several times, for unless one is a mystic or saint this is the closest one will ever come in this lifetime to witnessing the Passion of the Christ.

I will, however, try to give my two-cents-worth on it.The bottom line for me is this. This film is excellent. The performances are solid and emotional. The music is brooding, haunting, tense, and beautiful. The photography is the same for me. Often dark and gloomy and gritty but it works. It has a beauty all its own as well.Now let me use another g word. Gory. Be warned: This film is NOT meant as entertainment. It is like SCHINDLER'S LIST in the sense that it is unflinchingly brutal in it's depiction of a very emotional and true event.I was crying almost THROUGHOUT the film, at LEAST five times, but I lost count quickly. People asked me how old a child should be to see this. My answer was don't take children. If you REALLY want to, see it yourself and TALK with your child about it before going in. Be sure you know what a child can and cannot handle.Let me cut to the chase here. This film to me is NOT anti-Semitic. It did make me think though. It made me think how lucky I am that Jesus Christ really loves me and loves me enough that He would and has died for my sins and the sins of the world AND risen from the dead so that all who call on Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord can be with Him in Heaven forever. As a Christian, this film was a graphic reminder to me of the incredible price that my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ paid to redeem me from sin and death, and when I thought of that, I felt extremely blessed, lucky, and LOVED. I lnow the Bible speaks of this, and I am not saying this film should replace the Living Word of God, but it was for me a reminder of all that I just mentioned here.In short, go and see this if you can. It is a film that will make you cringe, and likely weep with the brutality it depicts, but it will also likely touch your heart and move you in a way that few movies ever can. To me it is the most moving film of the past 11 years. I hope that you can go see it, and if you do, may you come away with a reminder of just how much the Lord Jesus Christ really loves you.

The furious anger of the crowds against Jesus is bizarre and frightening, but never explained, so it is represented as pure blood lust.As a purely political movie, one might say this film shows that when the awful power of the state is combined with the enthusiasms of the mob, true evil will be done.All that said, this movie is a depiction, not a drama, and watching it, you are a witness, not an audience, and, as a witness, at times you feel very uncomfortable with the way the violence is being presented. There is an unmistakeable love for blood in this film, and it is an open question whether it reinforces or undermines the message. The only interesting character is Pontius Pilate, who struggles with his conscience (embodied on screen by his wife), but ultimately washes his hands of Christ to appease the angry mob.Gibson is still a man of Hollywood, and the movie does have a brilliant Hollywood ending; a brief image of Christ healed and resurrected, but bearing one very visible mark of his torments. This image embodies the new covenant represented by Christ. But its power probably depends on how much faith you have in Christ's divinity. If you are like me, thinking of Christ as a great teacher, but not God on earth the blood and suffering will seem over the top.

Thus, those who understand the theological message will not be so much offended by the violence as moved to greater spiritual awareness. Those who do not understand the message or simply do not agree with it will see nothing but senseless, meaningless, unrelenting violence.It has been funny to see Hollywood scratching its head, wondering how such a film (in Aramaic and Latin, no less!)could become the 9th most popular film of all time.

Davis,"[8, 10]","I have been scanning the reviews and I think that most of the reviewers can be pretty easily segregated into two extreme stereotypes: the Christians who naively think that watching this movie will transform the worldview of every viewer into an instant convert--which as a fellow Christian I find to be rather insulting of common sense--and the other extreme of non-Christians who had no idea what to expect from this movie other than what they should never have expected in the first place: an entertaining Hollywood flick.Make no mistake about it, the love of Christ is a love that disturbs. This is a very distrubing, non-entertaining movie, which is exactly what it was supposed to be.I give the film four stars instead of five for two reasons.1) It was marketed to Christians (good) but it was marketed as a mainstream theater flick (bad) in hopes that the casual observers would convert. I do not blame Mel for this directly, nor the filmmaking company. This was the fault of naive churches that embarrassed themselves by buying out theaters and harrassed strangers at the theater entrances. Mel did market to these churches directly, so there is some indirect responsibility there. This point is minor compared to #2, ...2) The film itself is unfairly incomplete. Mel had every intent all along to ONLY show Jesus' crucifixion, and, generally speaking, it was fairly true to scripture, if artistically exaggerated at times. However, while any section of the Bible put to film very well would earn five stars, this is nonetheless a movie, one that deserves critical evaluation from a movie perspective. It was a movie direction decision--not a Bible-documented reality, but a DECISION by Mel Gibson--to refuse to portray some of the pre-crucifixion ministry of Jesus. Granted, there are a few flashbacks during this film that portray the character of Jesus in various key points of his ministry, but these flashbacks are few and far between, buried in an agonizing mush of blood-splattering gore. From a movie critic perspective, despite my love for Jesus, and despite my tearful, full appreciation for what He did for me, nonetheless I would demand that my Jesus be portrayed as more than just some guy who was killed like a rose trampled on the ground. That is so important, yes, but a film about by saviour is incomplete without being a film that is also about my lord and my teacher.Most importantly, I would want a film about the passion of the Word who became flesh to absolutely include profound instances of Him declaring that he is I Am.I do think that the film was well-made for what it attempted to be--a very artistic painting from the mind of one artist that may or may not be fully appreciable by all Christians.Most certainly, this film should NOT be watched by anyone who has not been educated about who this man is or that he claimed to be God the Son who was dying for our sins, and why he was necessary, etc. Most uneducated non-Christians have proven themselves unable to bear watching this gore with enough curiosity to dig deeper and find out what it was all about. All they will see is a terrible murder.And I think it is a terrible act of naivety on the part of my brethren to have expected otherwise.On the other hand, this film certainly does make it easy to identify sheep from goats.

Since I hadn't experienced it by myself I refused to make an opinion out of something I didn't know unlike some others.Finally I saw the film and the word to describe it that comes to my mind is extraordinary.I didn't find anti-Semitism, which is not only something against the philosophy of Christians like me, but also against the very message of the film. The film can be seen as a story of forgiveness, love, sacrifice and faith. Anyone who thinks or perceives the contrary about it, didn't get it. Gibson said this himself and after watching the film, I must agree.But taking the religious controversy aside, the film is both beautiful and brutal. The cinematography is dazzling, the acting is astonishing, the frames are powerful in all senses. The film is in simple terms, a work of cinematographic art.I only found two problems, but I also understand their reasons.Firstly, there is too much violence and blood. Despite reality must have been like that (or even worst), Gibson took no compassion on the audience and pointed the camera right into the most difficult angle to watch emotionally speaking. His intention was clear, he wanted to ignite a storm of emotions on the viewer (and he succeeded), but personally I think it will take me some time to recover from that before I raise the courage of watching it again. Then again, this film is intended to be an artistic and personal experience, not an entertainment.Secondly, I felt Gibson left me in expectation. He used flashbacks to some of Jesus' teachings. Some of them, like the love your enemies, if you only loved the ones that love you, where would the merit be? were perfectly handled. But one in particular, the attempt to stone Magdalena, felt to me as if it should have been larger and more specific. I got the message, but I felt left in expectation. The other part, was Jesus' resurrection. A little time devoted to Jesus' contact with his apostles, or perhaps his conversation with Magdalena would have been welcomed. The film would have been around 10 minutes longer, but it would have been more powerful.But in the end, Gibson's intention was to show the last 12 hours, and in that he delivered in a extraordinary way.

You may object, but it is, after all, my opinion and not necessarily yours.Obviously this film was not intended to be entertaining. And it is not. The filming, directing and acting are superlative. I've never seen better.Although the film is based on the New Testament Gospels, which I have read off and on for three-quarters of a century, Mel Gibson took several liberties with the orthodox version of the events surrounding Yeshua's death, which is what the film was designed to portray honestly, as I understand it.I've sold Catholic Bibles, and am familiar with the protestant version as well. I don't recall any justification for the raven plucking out one of the thieve's eyes on the cross, as it was portrayed in this film. Also, the appearance of Satan with a reptile in the Garden of Gethsemani was a fictional addition. It is my understanding, also, that it was Roman practice to drive spikes through the wrist, rather than the palms--although the Bible does mention the resurrected Christ offering Thomas to touch his hand wounds. The nailed hands would not hold up the crucixion victim, but in this case his wrists were bound to the cross, which would seem to nullify that objection. and it was the custom for the crucifiction victims to carry only the crossbar, rather than an entire cross to the place of execution, as indeed the thieves were shown doing in the film. Why was He singled out? Maybe we'll never know the answers to some of these questions.When I was in my mid-twenties, in the best condition of my life, I think that I could not have carried a cross made of six-by-six timbers, of the size depicted, any distance. I could barely have picked it up, and I was a strong young man. The cross in the picture was carried by a man who had just been subjected to a scourging and whipping which had left him half dead, and judging by the amount of blood sopped up at the whipping scene by the women (Mary the mother of Yeshua (Jesus, in the Greek translation) and Mary Magdalene, he couldn't have had much blood left in his body, which brings up another problem: there is no mention in the New Testament of the women doing any such thing...and, why should they have?In the movie, he was tried four times, once by Caiaphas, the High Priest of the Jerusalem temple, once by King Herod, King of Judeaee, and twice by Pontius Pilate, the Roman Procurator. All in one night and day. And Herod's palace was not even in Jerusalem, although he may have been there for Passover. In three of the gospels, the trial by Herod is not mentioned; only the Gospel of John (the last of the canonical Gospels written) refers to it, and does say that he was in Jerusalem.First, he was beat up by the Jewish temple guards, who took him in Gethsemani with the help of Judas Iscariot (liberties were taken with his death scene, also), then Pilate had him flogged near to death (the beating alone, as depicted, would have killed any ordinary man halfway through it), and finally he dragged his cross all the way to Golgotha (with some help).The movie was filled with gratuitous brutality and cruelty not justified to the extent depicted by the accounts in the Christian canonical New Testament Gospels. In fact, throughout those accounts, the impression is that he was calm and dignified throughout the entire tribulation, until the very last, when he was on the cross. Even then, he seems to have maintained his composure, even through his pain. A far cry from the Jesus depicted in this film, I think.Which brings me to my main concern about this movie: No one can doubt that the Roman's method of capital punishment, crucifixion, was brutal. It is also written in the canonical Gospels that he, Yeshua, was scourged (whipped, or flogged), which necessarily was also brutal. But, even so, I, my wife, and the couple with us--although we were expecting to witness brutality--did not expect the horrendous, unspeakable brutality to which we were subjected, nor the heartless jeers and laughing of the Jerusalem crowds and the Romans who were inflicting the torture. It seemed endless, and unspeakable, comprising most of the movie. We were unanimous in our opinion that the movie was over the top in its depiction of cruelty. If the intent was to make the viewers appreciate Christ's suffering for our sake, as they all say, I think it was overdone. Most of us appreciate it already.This movie will probably win an academy award for filming, acting, directing, and a half-dozen other things. I repeat: it is not entertainment, nor ia it particularly edifying. Christians already know the story. Non-Christians have no reason to see it, and will not appreciate the subtle allusions to certain biblical references.As for the accusations of anti-Semitism, I think any hint of it was overshadowed by the rampant anti-humanism. The Romans were, by far, the most likeable characters, with the exception of His followers, although they were the ones who inflicted all of the brutality. There were at least a few of them who showed some humanity.DO NOT take a child to see this film. I was ready to leave before it was half over, because I had seen enough torture to last me a lifetime, and was not learning anything I didn't already know.I do not find this kind of film entertaining or edifying, and it is an experience that I can do without. Real life is bad enough, without depicting fictional events that are even worse.Sorry, Mel. Your heart was undoubtedly in the right place, and technically it was a masterpiece.

This movie does have a few flashbacks about his life, looking back at things that happened before he was captured but it's mostly about a short period in his life when he was captured that Mel Gibson made around 120 minutes of movie from.The Movie title Passion of the Christ is a perfect title to the movie cause what happens to Jesus in this movie, is literally beatings from the first to the last movie. It's defenitely not for the faint hearted. I asked myself the question, was this real? Cause you don't hear so often that Jesus was beaten this much and seing the movie really makes you feel uncomfortable about it. But I believe that this is the truth, If we should look at the bible it is most certainly the truth. When you make a movie that is historical it must be based on on the truth and not like Pearl Harbour, Troy or whatever. What I would have changed was the scene when the Roman soldier were going to punsih him, it's really too much. We got the point without having to see them beating him for 15 minutes til there weren't much left of him. I also believe that the Devil potraited by this woman wasn't neccesary, I didn't see the point in her appearence.What I liked and why this movie will go down in history is that it's truthful and that it is original but also very controvercial, making a story about the life of Jesus surely is one brave thing from Mt Gibson. The movie is also filmed in the south Italy, which looks like Isreal a bit and the language they speak is Arameic and Latin not English.

459,A2M8XFIIF9GPO5,310263662,Joseph Suglia The Greatest Author in the World,"[3, 17]","THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004)A review by Dr. Joseph SugliaMel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004) is a personal film. An exceedingly, excessively, earnestly personal film. Personal to the point of autobiography. It is not merely a personal reinterpretation of the Jesus myth, but a hand-wringingly serious APPROPRIATION of that myth for the sake of a deeply personal program.What that deeply personal program might be, is worth pondering. The film focuses exclusively on the condemnation, scourging, and crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth; the rest of his life is bracketed out. We see snapshots of his past in the form of flashbacks. But these flashbacks seem forced. They appear to be designed to make the torture seem relevant, i.e. religiously meaningful.The film has an INDEPENDENT investment in brutality, in cruelty. One suspects that Gibson has a particular interest in cruelty for cruelty's sake---not for any transcendent purpose.It is not accidental that THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST has horror-film elements: the attack on Judas at the hands of screeching daemon-children, the ubiquitous presence of an androgynous Satan, the demotion of someone-or-other to Hell, etc. THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is, sensu stricto, a horror film.Throughout, Jesus's VOLUNTARY assumption of his torture and death is emphasized. One of the strongest images in the film has The Christ embrace his own crucifix as if it were a lover. It is repeatedly stressed in this work that Jesus loves his persecutors, loves his persecutions, and welcomes and affirms his own death.Of course, there is scriptural evidence to support Jesus's affirmation of his own mortality. How blest you are, when you suffer insults and persecution and every kind of calumny for my sake. Accept it with gladness and exultation, for you have a rich reward in heaven; in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you [Matthew 5:11-12]. Anyone who has read the Gospels and the Gnostic texts, such as THE GOSPEL OF JUDAS, knows that Jesus's persecutors were acting according to a divinely ordained, prestabilized plan -- a plan that Jesus had accepted in advance.The undeniable accent on self-imposed violence, however, exceeds any religious justification. There is a kind of bloodlust in this film, a joy in the systematic reduction of a human body to dead meat. Religiosity, in this context, is used as a mere pretext for sexualized violence.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a violently pornographic film. It portrays violence as something that is deeply gratifying. Predictably, the film's creator and promoter is self-deceptive, dishonest, about its sadomasochistic dimensions.(Postscriptum: How is it possible that THE DREAMERS received an NC-17 rating for a smattering of male nudity and this film did not? A religious subtext pacifies the MPAA, it seems...).Dr. Joseph Suglia",2,A review by Dr. Joseph Suglia,1303344000,"04 21, 2011",-0.085

First of all the violence in the context of this film was a condemnation of cruelty. It is as it was, and (as bad as it is) , if anything the reality was more brutal than the depiction here. I did not experience the desensitizing of violence as some have described, I felt every blow. There is no pleasure taken in the cruelty on the part of the film. It is too much for kids that may not understand the context and message. (Certainly no one under age should ever see it, and then only some will understand it. It is rated R for a reason.Second the only prejudice in the film is (rightfully) against evil people and the one they serve. Yes, Satan is in the film. Before you say that artistic license was taken, I would assert that Satan being the father of evil is implicitly present where there is cruelty. By including Satan in the depiction, the film makes very bold and brave revelations on the nature of evil. There are profound truths revealed that no other film has addressed so directly and eloquently. Satan appears as a sadistic mocking force of evil that takes many forms but has a hideous similarity in every incarnation. You will notice in your own life that the most cruel people you encounter have that same presence. Another insight into the nature of evil that this film shows is that when a person does evil, Satan does not empower them or protect them, but instead takes as much pleasure in torturing them as he does in torturing the innocent. Those that say there is no message have not only missed all of this, but they have missed the messages of Jesus that are covered in the film.There is an amazing moment when I found myself thinking how shameful and tragic that God should give man the greatest gift and man destroys it, when suddenly the shot is from God's point of view and I am feeling the same as he is. The film is a true artistic triumph as well, with it's amazing cinematography, and in my experience the authentic language helped immerse me in the story. I am told that most people will need the subtitles.

A truely horrific film on many levels and I wish never to see it again.The film began wonderfully and even engaged me as I watched Jesus make the decisions he knew would take him down the path to his ultimate crucifiction. However as the film progressed the story, beyond its interpretive problems, grew into a movie of violence. I felt ill watching beating after beating and dramatic fall after dramatic fall. The realism although technically commendable was beyond gruesome and beyond reasonability. The story was far overshadowed by Mel Gibson's almost pornographic interest in the visciousness of the experience.To bring a movie goer into the character's pain and visceral anguish is good film making but the level to which Mel Gibson goes takes away so much of the story of the crucifiction.

468,A1LVZOK9F7K4CN,310263662,JR Pinto,"[1, 2]","So much has all ready been said about The Passion of the Christ, it is difficult to come to this review with an open mind. Indeed, so much controversy has been stirred, it was difficult to watch the picture with an open mind - I knew so much of what to expect. So, let's begin by addressing the Big Questions.Question #1, Is the film anti-Semitic? I do not believe so. It is true that the main villain in the movie is the high-priest Ciaphas. Some critics have protested that we do not see enough of the reasons for what he does. He was afraid of stirring up the people and he felt threatened by Jesus. That said, it is important to realize having reasons for doing a bad thing, does not excuse doing the bad thing. In this case, a supposed holy man, a hypocrite, is instrumental in having an innocent man tortured and killed. The same can be said for Pontius Pilate - yeah, he was trying to keep the peace, but since when is that an excuse for psychotic murder? Watching The Passion of the Christ, I was reminded of another movie - Schindler's List - in which an evil government used institutionalized torture and murder against the Jews. True, the Romans were not trying to commit genocide and they did not kill the millions the Nazis did, but the Jews were still subjugated. The Roman centurions are the real thugs of this movie.Question #2, Is the film violent? Yes. It is relentless in its depiction of Christ's torture. The complaint against most Hollywood Biblical epics is that they are silly, corny, sentimental stories. NOT THIS ONE. As soon as the film begins, it is in your face all the way. Another reviewer has claimed that the violence is pornographic, as if this were a snuff film. I have seen films with pointless violence - this is not one of them. People have grown familiar with the story of the Passion and they want it to stay nice, comfortable, and safe. IT IS NOT. The thing is that I believe that this is an ACCURATE depiction of what was done to him. Should we not see the senseless killing in Schindler's List? The concept that many people cannot grasp is, in movies ABOUT pointless violence, the violence is not pointless. The entire reason this movie exists is to show what Christ went through.This movie doesn't have an arc in the conventional sense. It is a docudrama chronicling that last hours of Christ's life. Jim Caviezel is a robust, manly Jesus. We can see how he could lead a vast movement. The film is heavy-handed in places - I was reminded of Jesus Christ Superstar when Herrod was portrayed as a demented drag-queen.Is the film powerful? Yes, undoubtedly so. You will be unable to get it out of your head afterwards. Yet, for all the violence, it is incredibly life-affirming. Jesus' message - that we all have to love each other - comes through. When we don't...well, just watch the movie.This film is capable of stirring tremendous religious fervor, and perhaps that's what people are afraid of. The final image of the film - I won't spoil it for you, but you should be able to guess - is incredibly uplifting. It almost has the feel of a superhero moment - inspiring all of us to take up our crosses and continue to fight for good.",5,An open mind...,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",-0.1119
469,ARLKYF9JL3QKB,310263662,J. SHARP,"[9, 14]","What the world needs now is one more opinion on Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, right?I am adding mine because some have asked for it. But, as has been noted hundreds of times over, the movie itself is only part of the experience that is The Passion. At this point the publicity, the prevailing Church attitude toward movies and celebrity, the accusations of bigotry, the accuracy and theology of the film, and the personality of Mel Gibson are of one cloth with it. So this will be a longer than usual review. It's taken me six months to write it.MEL - As Seattle film critic William Arnold says, I've been reading a lot about how Gibson has a martyr complex. I think that's ridiculous. Gibson is less a would-be martyr than a provocateur. There's something in his nature that delights in being abrasive and politically incorrect...He loves to light up a cigarette in places where it's forbidden.I agree. Mel loves to goad people then gauge their response.Is that what The Passion is about? I honestly don't think so. Mel seems to have put an earnest effort into realizing his conception of Christ on film.MARKETING - Of far greater concern to me was the rush of devout, well-meaning Christians to this movie's defense and its propogation - before it was even released. Gibson's passionate creation of this film was an overt mainstream validation that many orthodox Christians had been starving for. His Icon production company leapt on this fact and created an enormous grass-roots marketing campaign that was wildly inexpensive considering the saturation it achieved. With volunteers fanning out across the suburbs bearing posters and leaflets and churches eagerly buying billboards that had Mel's name next to the name of their church, it was probably the biggest publicity coup of the decade.ANTI-SEMITIC? - In my humble Gentile opinion? Not that I can see. Apart from the Romans, virtually every character in the story is a Jew. Besides the disciples, there are good and kind Jews depicted throughout. The Sanhedrin, the religious and civic governing elders, are even conflicted over whether to put Jesus to death, with several arguing against it. Their initiation of His crucifixion to eliminate a religious threat is not a Gibsonian invention, however. It is written in all the gospels. If this film reflects poorly on anyone, it's the Italians. The maddeningly sadistic scourging and crucifixion are their doing. Which brings me to the next point.SHOCKING - One alarming facet of the evangelical reverence of this movie is the prima facie acceptance of the blanching gore and violence that permeate the The Passion. Most viewers have to shut their eyes at points throughout the film and a few have even left to be sick. Yet some parents (who would never allow their kids to hear a swear word or a discussion on married sex!) took their younger children to it because they need to see what Jesus went through. This simply floors me. Yes, as a Christian I believe Christ's death and resurrection are the preeminent events in human history and the deciding factor in every human life. But Little Timmy is still wrapping his head around Sunday school stories about the sweet, smiling cartoon Jesus who coddles lambs in his coloring books being killed because Timmy stole his friend's Hot Wheel car and lied about breaking Mom's favorite vase. Although it is true, the concept alone is often confusing and worrisome to them as it is.Am I objecting to an honest and unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering on my behalf? If it evokes repentence, gratitude, and adoration, then not in the least. But if it lingers on it salaciously, then yes. I think that - by and large - this film accomplishes the positive results. But it sometimes veers into the gratuitous, too.I often compare The Passion to Saving Private Ryan. That film and its chilling brutality were both an awe-stricken acknowledgement of the sacrifice of the veterans of World War II and a visceral repellant against war itself. It was shocking but vitally necessary. So it can be argued for The Passion of the Christ. Jesus died a vicious death to rescue all of us. We should be reminded of that and be repelled from taking its cause - our sin - lightly.But young children should not watch either movie. Period. And I hope never to watch them (along with Schindler's List) more than a few times in my life. Any more than that and I might become desensitized to them and thus their central purpose. And that would be unwise.ACCURACY - It gets much of the biblically supported material right. BTW, the dream of Pilate's wife IS in the Bible (Matt. 27:19). The merely interpretive parts are often astonishlingly moving, even if they didn't necessarily happen that way.How does it fare theologically? Depends on your theology. The Passion makes it clear that Christ died to save the world. The most gutwrenching scene for me was when Jesus stumbles under the cross and tells Mary, See, mother. I'm making everything new.Those who complain that Gibson has minimized Jesus' message of peace, love, and understanding in favor of sin and death need to 1) See the movie again and 2) Read the Scriptures again. If Christ's was not the ultimate example of nonviolent conviction, I don't know what is. As the Son of God, He could have struck His executioners dead at any point along the way. But Jesus was not a first-century hippie, either. He spoke more of a literal hell and of complete obedience to God than anyone else in the New Testament. And, honestly, the last twelve hours of His life weren't very conducive to preaching on diversity.This is a decidedly Catholic film. For example, the Stations of the Cross (a sequence of passion events enumerated in the Catholic prayers of the same name) are dutifully enacted, even at risk of creating cinematic redundancy. Mary seems able to locate Jesus through solid rock floors by sensing Him. But the scenes and events based on the extrabiblical writings of mystics and on later traditions that are regarded as history by some Catholics are alternately distracting and disturbing.BUT IS IT A GOOD MOVIE? - There may be no objective way for me to watch this. I suppose the only way I can answer the question is by rephrasing: Was it a successful movie? Did it have it's intended effect on the audience?Yes. And then some.",4,A tough film to view objectively.

The film was well done and all of the actors gave outstanding performances. Yes, the story was brutal, but many of us were taught from childhood that the Way of the Cross was painful and traumatic. We were also taught that Jesus followed that path out of love for humanity. Jesus was portrayed as a human man who suffered an agonizing twelve hours before his death. The film seemed so real and the expressions on the faces of the various characters were fascinating to see. It was truly painful to witness the mother of Jesus, as she watches her son going through the worst of agonies. This movie could also be a lesson about mob violence. The cinematography was excellent and I felt that I was right there in the middle of it all.

There were also many people who had sure that this is one of the best Christian movies ever made. Every one has right to say his own opinion that's why I'm going to tell what I liked this movie.First, this is surely the most realistic film that tells Jesus's suffering. If you are not sadomasocist, you can feel how whiplashes and hits that Jesus has to take, makes you cry or feel bad. In my opinion, it's a good thing that modern people can feel how Jesus had to suffer. Crucifixion was the event that change the world. Jesus died a cruel and painful death because He paidour sins on the cross. There are many people who has realised the meaning of Jesus's crucifixion when they have seen this film.Second, James Caviezel is a real good actor. His facial impressions and the way of talk are perfectly suited on the role of Jesus. Other actors are only statistics comparing to him. Satan is also showed on this movie and the man who plays his partdoes it a wicked way.Third, I liked a lot the music of this film because its dramatic, touching and beatiful.The only thing why don't I give this film five stars is Jesus'sheavenly message too little showing. I mean His stories, mercy and miracle works. There are only little flashes from the past that shows you for exemple the Last Supper and Jesus washing his disciples feet. It would be wise to cut a little Jesus's torturing parts and add little bit Jesus's classical stories.Finally, If you are believer you shoud see this movie immediately because it maybe helps you realise how Jesus suffer to pay our sins. If you don't believe that Jesus died to save us for eternal desruction, you can also go to see this film. It'spossible that you wake up and begin to think these things fo other way.",4,The Ultimate Torturing of Jesus Christ,1083283200,"04 30, 2004",-0.0139

The only controversial thing I can see Hollywood getting upset over is the fact that Mel Gibson, chose to give the story of Jesus' final 12 hours the respect they deserve by truthfully, Biblically, and accurately depicting the events leading up to the crucifixion.The Passion of the Christ chronicles the final 12 hours of Jesus Christ, from the moment he was taken into custody all the way up to the crucifixion and resurrection. In that time we, the audience, get to see realistically what Jesus went through according to the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.Many critics felt the film was overly gory and grotesque in the way the scourging and crucifixion was portrayed. I beg to differ, the scourging was in line with the way Romans punished criminals, or in this case perceived criminals, and the crucifixion was portrayed very realistically. To ask Mel Gibson to not show the agony and torture Jesus endured to save mankind, would be a disservice to Mel's beliefs and the beliefs of other Christians, and Jesus himself. No director has ever shown this level of detail when depicting Christ's sacrifice for us, and that is a testament unto Mel Gibson for being so courageous.The Passion of the Christ is a brilliantly directed film, and Jim Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus was the most human portrayal of the Savior that I have ever witnessed.

But the point of the life of Jesus isn't how much torture he went through, and here is a simple fact: Watching anyone tortured for hours, be it either Jesus or a farmer or a slave who stole a loaf of bread, would make any normal person feel awful and cry. People have said, It's so sad when Mary, the mother of Jesus, watched him being tortured. I felt so bad for her. Okay, but the point is, if we were watching ANY mother watch ANY person being tortured for two hours, we would be compelled to feel intense sympathy for them. So the movie misses the mark, as if Gibson is trying to say, Look. See the pain Jesus had to go through? How awful, huh? Well, sure, but that would be awful for anyone to go through. What if they made a movie in a very graphic way about someone being burned at the stake in the Middle Ages? Like the many witches that were killed. They could draw out the psychological and physical pain of someone being tied up at the stake, the crying, the tortured expressions, the flames licking at the feet, slow motion camera movements, the flesh bubbling up as the flames grow, the hair burning, the frantic movement of the body trying to writhe away from the heat and the flames. It's just silly, you could make a drawn out movie about anyone's death. There is nothing unique about an awful death. Jesus' death was awful, but so were many other deaths.

This movie warrants that for its artistry and acting alone. The way words are conveyed through expressions and symbols that are more universal than the Christian religion itself makes one understand why Mel Gibson did not initially find it necessary to release this movie with subtitles.In the story of the last hours of Christ, we have a compelling story of betrayal, denial, greed, forgiveness, anger, envy, redemption and just about every single element that the Bible identifies as a fundamental flaw or attribute. What we see onscreen is not some anti-Semetic screed. Far from it. Gibson has taken liberties only in the scourging scenes that are performed by the Romans and in two flashback scenes meant to illustrate the human bond between he and his mother Mary. Both the Jews and Pilate are portrayed the way they are portrayed in the New Testament and herein lies the problem. For the fundamental divide between Christians and Jews is the story of Jesus and the New Testament. The New Testament is in and of itself anti-Semetic to many because of the way the death of Jesus has been used for hundreds of years to stereotype and persecute Jews. There are complaints about historical inaccuracies, but this seems like nitpicking in a movie that is so obviously relying upon faith and the book of that faith. You can't blame Jews for being sensitive to this issue, but the kneejerk negative reaction is both out of line and outdated for modern America.As for the film itself, Gibson has made an endurance test, but it all has a purpose. Those who say the lessons of Jesus are not conveyed in this film must not have watched it. For they are clearly and artfully conveyed through a series of well-placed flashbacks that tie in to the current situation being acted out on film. The underlying theme of forgiveness is emphasized on multiple occasions, so the serious watcher will not come away with the impression that he or she should go out and kill some Jews. At worst, they may come away with the condescending belief that they should openly forgive modern Jews for whatever ills their ancient ancestors inflicted upon Jesus.This is a movie about faith and reinforcing that faith by showing the suffering of Christ in his last hours-- the suffering that he apparently endured for all of man's sins. It is a very Catholic film in that sense because it really pushes the guilt-ridden side of Christian theology (i.e. Jesus died for us all so feel so terrible about it that you never forget it). But whether you believe in Jesus Christ or the historical accuracy of the Bible is not the issue. Whether you can accept this movie as an articulate portrayal of religious text is. There are certainly better stories to be found in both the Old and New Testaments, but Gibson has made this one as good as it can be. The film itself is visually one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The acting is magnificent and the costumes and settings perfect. The only problem with the movie is that the story is not particularly compelling to this non-churchgoer. Yet to Gibson's credit, he makes it at least interesting and emotionally charged. All of this is a credit to a great director who has assembled a very fine group and made a very fine film.If you doubt Gibson's intentions because you find him to be a religious nutjob, then I can only ask you to study a scene right at the end. When Jesus finally succumbs and is dead in Mary's arms, she looks down at her son, understandably griefstricken. You start to think that this is the part where Mel really sticks it to the Christ-killers. But no. Mary looks up with an unforgettable look of resignation and sadness in her eyes. It is not an angry look, but a look consistent with Christianity's most fundamental tenet-- forgiveness. That is the image that lasts when the movie ends shortly thereafter, and as a result it is also the lesson that lasts.",4,well done and well intentioned,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",-0.0369

I fear it is because it is straining to be something that it is not.

From the news to billboards to newspaper and magazine articles. The movie definitely lived up to the hype.This Jesus movie outshines the 50 others you could fine and for great reason as well. All other Jesus movies just take you right through, while Passion of the Christ diligently takes the time to accurately and vividly portray Jesus' final hours on Earth. This film adds on the realism by having the actors speak in Aramaic NOT English.The movie begins with Jesus' prayer in the garden and ends at tomb on resurrection Sunday. I must warn that this movie is not for the faint at heart either. When I said that this film vividly portrays Jesus' final hours, I meant it. They make the beatings Jesus take in this film very brutal. Even his crucifixion is barbarously dramatic. But the realistic drama in it all is what makes this gem so powerful and moving. The brutality in it all really makes you realize just how greatly Christ suffered for each and every one of us, believers and non-believers. The beautiful and peaceful score for the Resurrection as well as the scene of it all puts tears in my eyes every time I see it which capitalizes on this overall amazing, awe-inspiring Jesus adaptation.Overall: I have made it a tradition to watch this movie only once every year on the eve of Easter.

489,A3JJWHINQVAN5I,310263662,Karl Spence,"[13, 18]","Some common complaints about Gibson's film and/or the gospel accounts:1. Violence: Some reviewers complained that the scourging was overdone, that there is nothing in the gospels to indicate its severity. Not so. Jesus' quick death on the cross indicates the scourging was severe enough to be fatal. A healthy man could stay up there for days before dying. Jesus lasted only a few hours or less. It's the scourging that killed him.Some critics complained that Gibson slighted the rest of Jesus' story: his message, his miracles, his mercies. Other gospel films have done a better job in those respects. But in depicting Calvary, they fall short. The Passion is to those other gospel films as Saving Private Ryan is to The Longest Day. That latter film will give you a much better overall view of D-Day. But only Ryan will make you really scared to be anywhere near Omaha Beach. In the same way, other gospel films give a well-rounded picture of the gospels, but only Gibson's film has made me really weep for what Jesus went through.2. Anti-Semitism: Critics complain that the picture lets Pilate off too easy, and makes Caiaphas the instigator of the crucifixion. That's how it is in the gospels, of course, but why is that? Well, Pilate was a pagan. His gods fought and fornicated with each other, and with men, and beasts, all the time. Why should he care if some rube comes in from the sticks claiming to be the Son of God? Only Caiaphas would care about that. Only a devout Jew would take God seriously enough to put this man Jesus on trial. Only a devout Jew would rend his garments at what he took to be blasphemy, and then relentlessly seek the blasphemer's death. That's no criticism of the Jews. It's a compliment. God chose them for a reason, after all. Had they been mere pagans, they'd have just shrugged Jesus off, like the Athenians did Paul. Without the Jews there'd be no Torah, no Psalms, no prophets, no gospels, no Good Friday, no Easter Sunday --- no salvation. Then where would we be?Where Caiaphas failed as a person was in being self-satisfied, too sure of his own virtue to accept that the rebukes cast his way by this Galilean upstart were justified, too wrapped up in himself to see the divinity in Jesus' words, deeds, body, soul and life. Being blind to God --- isn't that the story of us all, until we are saved?In any case, Jesus said, Forgive them, father, for they know not what they do. They thought they were giving a blasphemer his just deserts (if they were Jewish), or swatting a seditious troublemaker (if they were Roman). Of everyone involved (other than those in Jesus' own circle), only Pilate's wife seems to have had a clue.I think Christians may come away from this film with a new sense of gratitude for Christ's sacrifice.

492,A3CF7B2U0IB8PS,310263662,Katie,"[42, 81]","First off, I am a proud conservative Roman Catholic who has been in Catholic school for almost 14 years. I admire Mel Gibson as a person, particularly for sticking to his religious beliefs so well in the secular Hollywood. But, no matter how much I like and respect the man, I cannot possibly bring myself to like this movie.I had to see this movie for my Confirmation class, so a friend and I went together. As I said, I have been in Catholic school all of my life. I have studied the medical process of Crucifixion in-depth. Due to movies, and plays, and Stations of the Cross, I have seen Jesus brutally killed over one hundred different times. I basically could stage my own Jesus crucifixion if I really wanted, I know what happens so well. So I will admit I was only anxious to see the movie for the controversial supposed anti-Semitic undertone (I was wondering if it was true; I found none personally)... and Aramaic, which is a sweet language.How do I put this nicely. Even when Jesus is being arrested, the unnecessary, non-scriptured violence already is beginning. They push him off of a cliff and he just dangles there! I almost burst out laughing, it was so ridiculous. Then there's the symbolism. Oh my heavens, the symbolism. It was like The Great Gatsby, the movie, only without the awesome characters, story, and the symbolism was incredibly forced. Some of it was just gross too. I'll get more into that later.Let's not forget the whipping scene... I sat through some of it, went to the bathroom, and then came back and they hadn't even finished with the first weapon! I am pretty sure that the scripture clearly states that Jesus was whipped 39 times, but, whatever. I wish that it had been done in like Jesus Christ Superstar with the guitar riff, so at least I could have enjoyed good music. By the way, The Passion's music sucks. It's similar to Troy, tries so hard to be disturbing and anguished but just ends up being a grating caterwhaul.There are some very beautiful scenes in the movie, don't get me wrong, ones that almost made me cry. These are the non-violent ones, where we flash back to Jesus' life and teachings and stuff that doesn't involve him being covered with blood. But they are too short-lived. For example, I've always found one of the most beautiful parts of the Crucifixion to be the part with the good thief. In the movie, it promises to have that same beauty, and I was awestruck for a moment... then the movie remembered Oh yeah, I'm supposed to be grossing people out and the bad thief got his eye pecked out by a bird. I kid you not. Therefore, these short, beautiful scenes are too few and far between to redeem the movie, though it's a shame because they were very well-done.The movie gets you so accustomed to blood that by the time when Jesus is basically all blood and no flesh, you're just ...eh. It desensitizes you. I was grossed out at first, then I grew used to it. It also gives you two very pretty people to look at so you're not too offended (Mary Magdelen and the Apostle John) Just when you think Jesus can't bleed anymore, he does.Also, the lack of accuracy drove me nuts because the whole point of the movie was to be accurate... that's even why they put it in Aramaic! For instance, Jesus carried the entire cross and the nails were through his hands. These have been proven to not be true; the wrists would have been pierced, and he would have just carried the horizontal part of the cross. Like I said, I wouldn't have cared as much if Gibson hadn't been so proud of his accurate portrayal. Then again, my medical student brother-in-law told me that no one can bleed that much and survive, so maybe I am giving this movie too much credit. It figures.I was NOT religiously touched nor enlightened; is there any person out there who thought that crucifixion was a walk in the park? If anything, the movie's total attitude was so stifling and had so much self-grandeur that I had to keep from laughing at times. I mean, it was completely ludicrous.When I went to Confirmation class to discuss the movie with my fellow catechumists, I found that I was not alone. Our catechist was very surprised to see that all of us had hated the movie and none of us were at all touched. A guy from my school summed up how we all felt: They didn't tell us anything about Jesus. It was like watching a stranger get killed. I think that's a good way of putting it. I didn't feel like the person getting maimed was my Lord and Savior. I mean, lots of people were crucified. I need to see a little more than that.Frankly, it scares me that there are people who bought this movie and will be watching it more than once. To me, it is hollow and I get more out of hearing the Passion read at Palm Sunday mass, or attending the Holy Week masses like the Easter Vigil, or even listening to Jesus Christ Superstar, which is what I like to do every Good Friday. Heck, I got more profound religious meaning out of a documentary on the Shroud of Turin than this tripe.",1,Takes itself so seriously you just have to laugh,1106092800,"01 19, 2005",0.0932

The last twelve hours of Jesus's life are depicted with extreme brutality, and here is where the problem lies. I'm sure there is a story beneath the blood but it's hard to dig out. Jesus's message was love and he believed in his father, and he stood up for his beliefs. The movie starts out very interesting I must say, but once the punishment begins on Jesus the whole motive of what Gibson is trying to say is lost in a haze of brutal beatings and lacerations. Gibson said that he wanted to shock people, showing him what Jesus went through for the sins of mankind and to me he did a good job, but was that his only motive of the film? To me it seemed so. The message I got from the movie is This is Jesus, he died for our sins, and we must cherish him for it. The beatings are very brutal, some of the most if not the most brutal scenes ever filmed. In one instance Jesus is whipped with multiple shards of metal that hook the skin and when pulled it rips the skin. The crucifixion is quite bloody yet powerful because it does the job of shocking people. Every now and then we enter a flashback where Jesus recounts his work for god and in delivering his message, and to me that is where the story that Mel is trying to tell is trying to jump out. The most impact that came out of the movie for me was the cinematography. The movie was beautifully shot, and I mean beautifully, especially the amber toned colors used. In the end I saw the real story poking out here and there but just as it did the audience gets another heavy dose of brutality.ACTING: The acting is very well done, given the circumstance that there is hardly any dialogue and when there is dialogue it is very simple. I did find it impressive how James Caviezel was able to show true pain through his facial expression, the audience really felt his suffering, and that is a real high point of the movie.BOTTOM LINE: A movie that is worth seeing not for the story but for the result of the movie as a whole. Some parts I was saying oh come on, especially during Jesus's walk up to the hill carrying his cross and being beaten every inch of the way. I know he has gone through more pain than any man could bare but there was one too many slow motion shots of Jesus falling down as if that were his last step only to get up again and continue. In the end it is very powerful and emotional, but if you're not religious don't expect to be moved too much.The Passion Of The Christ (Religious Perspective):(* combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt combined_data feedbacks_data meta_data readme_samples_data.txt samples_data_script.sh test1.txt 1/2)STORY: A powerful and moving experience that depicts Jesus's last twelve hours. In the film audiences will embrace the suffering that Jesus had to encounter in his sacrifice for all of man's sins. Mel Gibson depicts evil in this film in some very disturbing scenes. Evil is depicted throughout the film as a pale hooded being with no eyebrows, no hair actually at all. In one scene Judas is trying to rid some children who are yelling at him for being cursed and he sees evil and disturbing faces upon them. In another scene the Evil figure is carrying a demonic looking child who smiles at Jesus as his skin is being literally ripped off. In one very moving scene a man who is forced from the watching crowd to help Jesus carry his cross tries to alienate himself from the situation at first only in the end to be connected with Jesus. The crucifixion of Jesus is the most brutal yet the most moving, you will see some very realistic brutality. The nailing of the hands and feet are probably the most brutally depicted act in film history. Never once does Jesus argue with the men and women who accuse him and as he hangs from the cross he pleads with God to forgive them. A powerful message stated is to love your enemies because loving and praying only for your loved ones shows no humanity. Jesus's message is peace and love. There have been many controversies over the film being anti-Semitic, blaming the Jews for Jesus's death. I found no such instance of that in the film and if you decide not to see it for that reason, you should think it over.ACTING: The portrayals of the biblical characters were moving and emotional. Jesus was portrayed excellently. The reaction of his family was poignant and heart filled with sadness and loss. Moving performances from the entire ensemble.BOTTOM LINE: A moving experience that will open eyes for people to the history of this tragic event. It is shocking, and brutal. Definitely not for the young even if it is for religious purposes, do not take a child to a movie like this leave the biblical cartoons for them on Sunday mornings. Mel Gibson's vision can be seen as flawed in the movie making world but as a message it is strong and out there.",3,The Passion Is An Extraordinary Film,1079222400,"03 14, 2004",-0.1111

It is very acurate to the Bible, very extremly realistic in how he dies, and it doesn't make it look like the Jews killed Jesus. In the movie, its a small group of high priests of the Jewish religion, trying to kill Jesus. During the priest's trial of Jesus, one of the priests even comes out and says where is the rest of the consul?, and they only push him away. Its very clear (unless you're stupid) that the Jews didn't kill Jesus, only a small group of high priests, and some followers. It is also very, very, very acurate to the Bible, and it sort of combines all four Gospels. Another thing: this movie is very brutal, and the violence is very graphic; from the scourging of Jesus, to the crucifixion itself. It shows his skin being ripped apart in the scourging, a thorn crown with the thorns being pushed into his head, his hands and feet being nailed to the cross, and him suffering on the cross. So if you can't take someone being tortured badly, or you're thinking of taking a younger person (around 13.5 and younger) because its a movie about Jesus, don't. It is very violent. That doesn't stop it from being a great movie, so go see it. What i didn't like about the movie was, it should have done more on the resurrection. The crucifixion is a big part of the Christian religion, because he saved us from sin on the cross, but the resurrection is bigger. They only had a little part at the end showing the tomb opening, with Jesus standing up with holes in his hands.

497,AGHVQ841IR6GO,310263662,Keith C. Bradbury,"[5, 6]","This movie will not leave your head. You may walk out of the theatre numbed, stricken, or even uncertain of what you have just seen, but it will sink in and stick in your mind for long after you have seen the movie.The movie has chosen to focus on the moments from the Garden of Gethsemane to the events immediatately following the crucifixion, with an epilogue touching on the resurrection and a handful of flashbacks to break the intensity of the graphic details of the torture of Jesus. In Catholic terms, the movie has focused primarily on the stations of the Cross.If the movie has any failings, it may be that it does not explain all of the imagery that it chooses to use, which at times are either extra-Biblical (not contained within the Gospel narratives) or artistic interpretations. But often, such imagery can cause one to seek the deeper meanings represented by them, so it is not necessarily bad to have these. Some of these scenes are cultural (for example, Mary wipes up the blood of Jesus with a cloth, which is a culturally accurate portrayal, as the blood was buried with the body of those who died). Others are artistic interpretations (a snake proceeds from Satan, which Jesus crushes the head of, which is a signifying of the fulfillment of the prophecy of Genesis 3:15; this is not something that Jesus did literally in the Garden, but accomplished through His death). Some scenes, however, border on the bizarre (causing me to actually question why Mel saw the point of actually including them): Satan with the baby (presumably carrying the anti-Christ, although this is never truly explained), the psychotic apparitions experienced by Judas, or the crow incident with the thief on the cross (completely unscriptural and oddly out-of-place). I'm certain they had significant meaning to Mr. Gibson, thus their inclusion, but these may be lost on the audience.While this is a movie that depicts violence, it in no way glorifies it. The amount of violence can be numbing to some, overwhelming to others. However, the depiction is accurate, including the Roman use of the cat of nine tails, which featured a whip with nine lashes, each typically having shards of metal or glass to rip the flesh during torture. The Romans were notoriously violent, ruthless, and on the average, they absolutely hated the Jews. To them, Jesus was another Jew and they no doubt took great delight in delivering out punishments on this magnitude. In fact, historians recording the events of the sacking of Jerusalem by Rome in 70 AD commented that there was no room to plant a cross because the Romans crucified just about every Jew they got their hands on.Some have questioned whether Pilate should have been portrayed in such a sympathetic light. Certainly, historians of that period identified him with tremendous cruelty, saying that he delighted in freely shedding the blood of the Jewish people in times of irritibility. In AD 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, after which he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide. In all likelihood, Pilate saw Jesus as simply another Jew, dispicable in his eyes. This view may have changed after the prompting of his wife, who had dreams regarding Jesus' innocence, or it may have changed during his actual encounter with Jesus. Pilate had put down numerous rebellions before, but Jesus was completely unlike the other anti-Roman elements he had crushed previously. Unlike the power-greedy Sanhedrin, Jesus did not suck up to him. Nor, like the zealots and leaders of previous revolts, did Jesus curse and defy him. Perhaps, in these moments, he truly came to see Jesus as unlike those he had encountered before. We are never truly told what Pilate thought regarding Jesus, apart from the Biblical account that he did not believe the accusations regarding his guilt.Some may wonder, Why is there so much focus placed on the torture and blood of Jesus in this film? Central to the Christian faith is that it is by the blood of Jesus we receive forgiveness of sins. Mr. Gibson has chosen to focus on this central element. Every individual is guilty of sin that separates us from God; sin that must be atoned for by the blood of the perpetrator (the penalty of death). Rather than accept this as the ultimate fate for all of His creation, He allowed for the substitutionary willing sacrifice of Jesus, who was both fully God and fully man. That Mel Gibson chose to depict his own hands as driving the nails into Jesus was Mel's way of showing what His very sin had caused, but what God so willingly gave in order to forgive him.Amazingly, in spite of early charges of anti-Semetism, this film goes out its way to present the Jewish people with a dignified realism. Yes, there were the powerful who saw Jesus as a threat to their power. There were others who saw through this and refused to be a party to an illegal trial. There were others who wanted to go about their own life, but were thrust into the middle of the whole situation.Ultimately, this movie is about one message, and one message alone. It is central to the blood, the violence depicted against Jesus, and the ultimate reasons behind the crucifixion. That message is that there is only one way to restore the relationship between God and man, and that is through the substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus (His blood). That is why Mel Gibson chooses to focus in on lines like, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except by Me and the flashbacks to the Last Supper, where Jesus depicts the bread and wine as His body and blood, given freely for their salvation. Even the Jewish leaders give reference, in their accusations against Jesus to Pilate, that Jesus said they must eat his flesh and drink his blood (not that Jesus was speaking of cannibalism here, but that He was clearly teaching that His self-sacrifice was central to the salvation of humanity).",4,It will stick in your head.,1078185600,"03 2, 2004",-0.1313

499,A2HG5MY4YOY7N2,310263662,Kelvin H.,"[4, 4]","I am a moviegoer and not a scholar of religion so it is my obligation to critique The Passion of the Christ aesthetically. Therefore, The Passion of the Christ is a great movie that will forever resonate in the history of the cinema. It is a beautifully shot film where the contrast between darkness and light accentuates the beauty of the aura of Jesus Christ. Unlike other Biblical adaptations, Gibson's new film is flushed with dramatic colors that appear gritty in order to emphasize realism. It is not idealized for it is emphatically proven through the sheer violence.The movie opens with Jesus in the evening at the Garden of Gethsemane, where everything appears cold and vile. Caleb Deschanel, the cinematographer, does an exquisite job in painting out the mood with its contrast between shadows and light. At first, Gibson did not want to include subtitles because he wanted to tell the story through images alone and I believe it would have been persuasive. In a story where it clearly deals with the battle between good and evil, Gibson and Deschanel designed the cinematography where lightness and darkness are fighting for their share of screen space.The Passion of the Christ deals with the last twelve hours of Jesus' life with occasional flashbacks. There is no setup or a background insight as to why Jesus is being persecuted but there is no need for it because the only importance is the sacrifice of Jesus. Also, I guess Gibson expects us to know and if not, we should research. There is not much plot but simply the journey Jesus makes carrying the burden of the wooden cross up to Golgotha. Gibson basically follows the story set by the scriptures but only twice does he deviate from it. The first is introducing Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) into the narrative and the second is adding more emphasis to the role of Simon of Cyrene. The Satan character is done so seductively that it will send chills down your spine. I love how Gibson chose to portray evil as beautiful, seductive, and wicked as a way to entice desires. I also admire Gibson for adding depth to the character of Simon of Cyrene who helps Jesus carry the cross. It addles me how even with Gibson's mold of Simon of Cyrene; people still dare to accuse him and this film of being anti-Semitic and the ignition of it.",5,The Best Depiction of the Bible,1077926400,"02 28, 2004",0.0325
500,A2D9IEFJGB483Q,310263662,Kendal B. Hunter,"[7, 12]","Passion Re-CutThis is a review of the Recut edition of The Passion. The film flows easily and the six missing minutes were not needed. Gibson should have left the film unrated, and left out these offensive six minutes in the first place. Notwithstanding this, I was quite impressed with Gibson's directorial abilities. He is quite a talent, akin to Nemoy or even Welles. I hope he nurtures this gift.As to the content, there is nothing new in this movie. The bare facts of the Christ's Atonement have been film and refilmed man times with many different actors. The only new things deal with cinematography, and then the presentation of the side characters. And the intensity of the violence. Of course the Romans were not wimps, and scourging and crucifixion were excruciating. Gibson saw as his goal the most accurate representation of this scourging. IMHO, we get the idea, and to emphasize the gore is emphasizing just one aspect of the Atonement, and it can distract from the ultimate victory.I found the subtitles helpful. You get the idea, but the film is infinitely better when we see Christ's almost nonchalant approach to his death. He takes time to mister words to his mother (only a Catholic would pick up on this), keeps his peace with Herod, debates philosophy with Pilate (in Latin), and is absolutely above it all. He must be a lunatic, or . . .In addition to the subtitles, the subtleties were also helpful. You see Pilate caught between his wife's dream, his sense of honor, and the pragmatic desire to keep peace and keep his political position. The encounter with Claudia and the Marys (something only a Catholic would see) is priceless.As to the alleged anti-Semitism, I just remind people about Seinfeld's Uncle Leo. The reason why Seinfeld created Uncle Leo is that many people make anti-Semitic accusations at the drop of the hat, or as they are passing the hat. This is just a way to avoid dealing with Gibson's message and passion.SPOILER WARNING:I am a bit critical of the special effects, specifically the snake-up-the-nose, and the growling troll under the bridge. I understand that the Gollum-Baby was an attempt to mock the true Madonna. However, these scenes gave the film a Lord of the Rings feel. It may be asserted that this is the TRUE Lord of the Rings, but to give the Atonement a surrealistic feel could leave some people with the idea that the Atonement is surreal. Then God is surreal, and ultimately we are surreal-like the Matrix.I understand that devils are real, but they were depicted as run-of-the-mill Scary Teen Movie type bogeymen. Frankly, some people cannot make the distinction. This film was not allegory, as Narnia or Middle-Earth, but a historical film. Keep the two separate.END OF SPOILERGibson, in addition to being a devout Catholic, is a good Kierkegaardian. Both understand the relationship between aesthetics, ethics, and spirituality. If you can artistically present the spiritual and ethical, then you are likely to succeed in presenting your message. For some people, this is the only experience with the Atonement. If people can get past this film, and find God, then this film will be successful.",5,"Review of recut, NR Edition",1110844800,"03 15, 2005",0.0936

But I saw it last night on a whim and I have to say I thought it was fantastic! Firstly, as a movie it is incredibly well shot. The scenery is wonderful and the sets are painstakingly recreated - never once do you doubt this is 1st century Palestine.The acting starts off a little strained in the garden scene, when the movie is just finding it's feet (and the audience is coming to terms with the fact that the movie isn't some horrible, cheap propaganda short, but a proper movie) but quickly becomes impressive and ends up brutally real.Gibson has set out to make a compelling dramatization of the last 12 hours of Jesus' life as described in the Gospels and that's pretty much what he does. There is certain artistic license taken and some good abstract movie-making, but nothing that really detracts from the movie or the sentiment. In fact the scenes where they have the Billy Corgan/ Marylin Manson devil figure floating around are amongst the strongest scenes in the movie (Especially the gratuitously freakish defomed child at the whipping! What was that about?!). The movie is shocking, and at times painful to watch. I think the movie only strays into questionably graphic violence occasionally, most notable when Christ's hands are nailed to the cross and we see blood squirting up onto the Roman soldier's smirking face. That's a touch over the top for my taste.Being an UWS-dwelling New Yorker, I had the anti-Semitic accusations in the back of my mind for the whole movie, and I have to say I found nothing that could possibly be construed as anti-Semitic. Instead the movie shows a nuanced and balanced set of Jewish characters who run the gamut of emotions from hating Jesus to loving him from falsely accusing him to insisting on a fair trial. To read some press reviews I'd assumed the movie was full of big-nosed demons laughing maniacally in shadowy corners - that impression is patently absurd, in fact even Jesus' Pharisee accusers are sickened by his whipping and turn away in anguish and perhaps contrition. If anything it is the Romans who 2000 years later are amongst Catholicism's staunchest supporters, that revel in the torture and mockery of Christ. But hey, it's all there in the gospels.I think this is a pretty Catholic film. Historically the Catholic faith has always revered the human side of Jesus more strongly. They worship him for his suffering on our behalf his death for our sins, and yes his long, drawn out death. Speaking from the Protestant tradition I'd prefer to see a movie that celebrated Jesus' life and teachings more than his suffering, and perhaps brought out the good news of his resurrection more than this movie, but hey, Mel has another 33 years of material to work with should he choose to make a sequel or a prequel.I'm not sure that this movie will make many converts - it's a compelling and powerful piece of art, but any theology is brief and death related - flashbacks to scenes in Jesus' earlier ministry deal with specific death prophesies (This is my Body, broken for you... etc) or somewhat heavy-handed juxtapositions of his teaching vs his treatment (Love thy neighbour, and love thine enemy likewise.). I'm not sure that this condensed and selective teaching will convert anyone up front, but it's already made me reread a few of the gospels.Anyway, I think it's a movie everyone should see to make up their own mind about - personally I can't wait for the DVD release so I can watch it without subtitles, as Gibson originally intended. That'd be even more brutal...",5,Quid Est Veritas?,1078272000,"03 3, 2004",-0.1081

Cockrel,"[0, 0]","You have to wonder if Mel Gibson doesn't have a serious torture fetish.After all, his Oscar-winning Braveheart ended with Scottish rebel leader William Wallace being disemboweled and ultimately beheaded. Though that film featured enough blood and flying limbs to rival your average zombie movie, Wallace's torture was mostly left to the viewers imagination since the camera didn't actually show blades connecting with flesh.This is not the case with The Passion of the Christ which shows, in gruesome detail, the scourging of the Messiah and his eventual crucifixion. I have to wonder, did it really need to go so far over the top in these scenes?Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the Bible knows that Christ suffered for our sins but with The Passion Mel Gibson seems to be saying, Hey kids, Christ really, really, REALLY suffered for your sins. I know this and can accept that as Gibson's interpretation of the gospel. But I still find myself wondering, What was the point?This is not to say that the film is bad. The direction and cinematography is excellent and the performances are uniformly superb. Plus you have to admire Gibson's tenacity and unwavering commitment to getting this film made his way even as major studios ran from it in fear of its explosive subject matter. The film could just as easily have been titled The Passion of Mel Gibson given that this was clearly a labor of love project, which as we all know by now has paid off handsomely for him.As of this writing, The Passion is one of the top 10 grossing films of all time and still climbing.But you still have to wonder if, in focusing so much of the film on Christ's brutal last hours, if Gibson didn't blow an opportunity to present an even more intimate and eye-opening view of his life. To me, some of the film's most interesting scenes are the flashbacks earlier points in his life. During these scenes we see his interaction if his disciples, with Mary Magdalene, and with his mother Mary.In fact, one of most fascinating scenes is one depicting Christ at home building a table and then sitting at it to discuss his craft with his mother. I wanted more scenes like that.Of course, many could argue that this would have made for a much different movie. Maybe.

First of all this is Christ's Passion as Mel Gibson sees it, is his particular gospel. Is a very personal, very pious version but it is not attach to the canonical gospels, there are too many deviations from scripture to call it base on them . Gibson used many sources outside of the Bible. Second is not historically acurate in many things. The most basic one is that the common language back then and in that area was greek, the english of the times, so you can bet when Jesus and Pilate spoke it wasn't in latin, it was probably greek, even when is very possible people back then knew the basis of many other languages and local dialects. And not going to talk about the whole crucifixion thing, anyone with a small background in ancient history knows is based on medieval images and misconceptions, is not at all a first century execution.Perhaps the most talk about aspect of the film is the violence. Ok, Jesus received one hell of a beating, you can be sure about that, but nobody would have arrives alive at the cross after the one in the movie, even if you consider Him(as I do)to be perfect God, perfect man. I understand this is like a painting in motion, a way of display the idea of God's eternal love for us and his sacrifice for those that are not worthy of been forgiven.Is Art, is an interpretation, but I believe Gibson and his crew went to far. The whole scourging secuence could have been half that long and the impact kept the same.That said is a good movie, it shakes you to the core. My favorite scene, well is not on the Bible but it makes perfect sense, is when satan is tempting Jesus in the garden and a snake appears coming from Satan's robes crawling towards Him. Then Jesus stands and squashs the snake's head looking at the enemy with a firm I am God, don't come with your cheap tricks to Me stare.

I, without seeing the theater release (I didn't really want to be exposed to other opinions until I had my own), wanted to dismiss POTC as a vehicle for media sensationalism and Hollywood glorification. Mel did a fine job making Braveheart a bloodbath and thought this was an extension of that style. And it still is in many respects, obviously.I read the Bible. I own the DVDs JESUS and THE GOSPEL OF JOHN. They both bring up valid viewpoints and portrayals of the Christ (even if the GOSPEL OF JOHN is quite literally a linear interpretation of the Book of John). Both celebrate the *life* and *message* of Jesus. What POTC does differently is tell that message cinematically through the betrayal and scourging and ultimately His Crucifixation. I especiallly approve with the decision to use languages native of the time. Mel spends some cash on this piece and it's a risk for the casual viewer. But obviously anyone who does his or her homework can follow along without subtitles quite effortlessly. Remember that POTC is *not* meant to be a substitute for the written Word. It is an artistic scrutiny of Jesus's final hours.The DVD's anamorphic 2.40:1 widescreen layout is simply put; breathtaking. The picture quality is on par with the best of 'em. The audio is also put to good use. Listen to the crowds laughing and murmuring during the Christ's trial. The dialog is clear and makes the Aramaic easier to digest. The only thing holding back a 5 star rating is a lack of extras other than setup options and the chapter list.

It's too violent for young children(and some adults), but I suggest watching it with older kids(thirteen and up) because there is so much more here than beatings and blood. It's a true story about a man who died for the sins of the world. Whether or not you believe that Christ was the Savior, you'd be sick to not have any type of feelings for Him in this film. If you are a Christian, like myself, then you were probably moved or disturbed in a greater way than if you were an athiest. If you are Jewish, then you might have been angered by the portrayal of your people. Muslim, Buddhist, agnostic, etc., no matter who you are, you came out of this movie feeling different from everbody else. None of that matters if you look at this film as being the story of a real person who is beaten and condemned to death for standing against the crowd. The agony that Jesus endures in this film will wear you out. This isn't a gorefest like some believe, it's real. Mr. Gibson might have taken a few light liberties with the Gospel, but the point he gets across is that the final few hours of Jesus' human life on earth were barbaric, grotesque, emotionally and mentally draining, and full of both hatred and love toward Him. Not only do you witness that, but you see the insanity that just might have gone on inside Judas' head after betraying Jesus. You see the confusion and disbelief in Peter's eyes when he denies Jesus for the third time, just as Jesus said he would. You see the agony and pain in Mary while watching her Son suffer. The worry of possibly being held responsible for the death of the Christ is evident in Pontius Pilate's eyes as well. Every person portrayed in this film reacts to the cruelty unfolding in front of them in a different way, just like it still happens today when we see people murdered, tortured, raped, etc. on the news and on the street.In all, this movie is a story about humanity. We see the ugly side of ourselves in the Roman soldiers beating Jesus. We see the love and warmth experienced between a mother and her son with the interaction of Jesus and Mary. Everything plays out masterfully and with little dialogue. That is why this film is worth five stars. It's a great story about humans being humans. That's why we are repulsed by the violence in it, because WE ARE CAPABLE of such violence. That's also why we are moved by the love in this film, because WE ARE CAPABLE of that as well.In closing, don't view this film as a Christian, a Jew or anything else.

The film opens with Jesus being tempted in the garden, his trial before Caiaphis, Pilot, and Herod, the Roman's whipping him, carrying the cross, and his crucifixion and a very brief resurrection sequence.The film looks like it was crafted on a much larger budget than Gibson's 30 million dollar investment, which is modest compared to many hollywood films. The acting is super. Jim Caviezel probably gives the best portrayal of Jesus ever film. He is able, I assert, to give Jesus the universial appeal deserved in such a character. Maia Morgenstern is outstanding as Mary and her portrayal brings compassion from the viewer. Monica Bellucci is great as well. One of the most intriging characters is how Mel uses Satan. The charcater is adrongynces looking and comes at times in the film adding the dimension that this is more than a physical battle, but a truly spiritual war. It is nothing short of genius.The film score compliments the film. The film does suffer from some flaws. The resurrection is so brief that Christ looks more like the victim than the victor. Sure he was a victim, but as Lord he is also the victor, and after such an intense two hours of physical and spiritual violence, a stonger resurrection scene would have inspired more hope in the viewer.The flashback scenes are very necessary and allow the viewer to escape the violence in the film, if only for a minute.

The prosperity of Gibson's film is based in its Christian theme, which attracted large masses of folks in the western world. The hysteria around the film was augmented through word of mouth as people were willing to discuss Passion of the Christ before it was released. This frenzy around the film brought the film a lot of free advertisement around the world, which made the film a huge success in the Box Office.The film follows the 12 hours before Jesus Christ's (James Caviezel) crucifixion, which is full of violent behavior. This violent behavior is brought to the screen through untouched brutality as the body of Jesus is kicked, desecrated, tortured, and whipped numerous times with monstrous tools before he was crucified. These scenes of violence progressively get worse as the film continues as Gibson makes an honest attempt to recreate a world of past where poverty and ignorance were common. There is not much room for compassion, but when it exists it offers some hope for mankind. It is for this hope that Jesus endures the pain brought upon him by mankind.Passion of the Christ is a cinematic experience that triggers a strong distaste for brutal violence as it is turned into a maximum in the film. The violence is necessary in order to display the revolting behavior of people, which is nauseating, and it is for this violent behavior Jesus sacrifices himself to save mankind.

What I saw was a very moving, compelling and disturbing dramatization of the last 12 hours of Christ's life. The violence in the movie was extreme, yet there were only a couple points that I would say were gratuitous. One would be the very long procession to Golgatha and the second would be the crow incident. Those who have seen the movie will undoubtedly undertand exactly what I am referring to. Also a bit over-dramatized is the guilt of Judas Iscariot. The scenes with the children beating him and Satan watching were truly disturbing. Exactly what Gibson wanted but I am not sure if it was necessary. I think that the movie is visually stunning and technically excellent. It is well researched with excellent actors and actresses. The use of subtitles does not in any way detract from the impact of the movie. There are some criticisms however: 1) There is not enough of who Jesus is. We see bits and pieces in flashback, but more could have been added during some of the more extreme scenes ie the second half of the flogging 2)There is not too much information about Jesus' followers. Peter is mentioned and John seen as is Judas but of the other 9 nothing. Of the 2 Marys, one is obviously the mother of Jesus, but it is not apparant who the other is till much later. For all the information you receive about her she could be any of the many women who followed Jesus. The third and final criticism is about the finale. Gibson spends the entire movie building up Jesus' suffering and death and the payoff is the Resurrection, but the Resurrection only gets maybe 30-45 seconds of screen time. This is a bit of a letdown. The audience has seen the suffering yet is really denied the triumph. The actors do a great job in promoting emotion etc. Caviezel plays Jesus with a quiet majesty and in the flashbacks, his performance is so good I wished for more. As for the charges that film is anti-semitic, they are ludicrous. First, historically, it was the leading pharasees who wished for Jesus death. That is historic fact. The Romans were instruments of that death. Gibson's film points out that not all of the leaders wanted death for Jesus and many were oppossed to the trial itself. The crowd was paid off as seen in the movie. The brutality of many of the Romans is caused by the alcohol they drank before the crucifixtion, which is obvious especially around the cross. The soldiers involved in the scourging did not seem to have an excuse for their cruelty, as they were not drinking. Gibson does point out the sympathetic Romans also. Unlike the TV movie Jesus from a couple years ago Pilot is portrayed not as insane but as indecisive and scared. This also comes through. Overall the Passion of the Christ is a very good movie that builds up to a climax that is underplayed. It's not the best movie about Jesus ever made, that would probably be Zefferelli's Jesus of Nazareth, but it is a well-made thought provoking movie.",4,"Powerful & Compelling Film, but Climax Lacking",1077667200,"02 25, 2004",-0.1098

A faithful translation of Christ's arrest, torture, and execution drawn from the Gospels, Mel Gibson's labor of love and anguish drives home the pointed magnitude of the Lord's sacrifice like no other adaptation before. For two hours the audience vicariously mourns and bleeds with the Messiah as He bears the unimaginable burden of mankind's sin to the grave and beyond. The camera rarely flinches, and the only respite from the onscreen horror comes in a series of flashbacks highlighting such vital Gospel moments like the rescue of Mary Magdalene, the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper. But this is not your typical cinematic mayhem; the violence in this movie is vital to the truth. Gibson wanted to show people what the Lord really put himself through for us. Yes, Jesus was the Son of God--but He was also a man, and the sufferings He endured for us were terrible indeed. We are, truly, bought at a precious price.Stylistically, the movie never flags. The performances are uniformly excellent (James Caviezel's valiant submission to his role as Christ is particularly stirring and heartfelt), the shot selection innovative (one shot in particular shows us what it might look like if God were to weep)and the tone reverent and somber, as it should be.Moreover, Gibson does not shy away from the reality of the spiritual warfare that we are all involved in whether we like it or not. Evil lurks in the shadows, haunting, goading and tempting. Christ refused to give in; so must we.Criticisms of this film are unfair and misplaced. Of course it is a violent film; crucifixion is violent. Yes, there is a lot of blood--but that blood is salvation for you and me. As for the issue of anti-Semitism, it hardly merits mention. We are all guilty of Christ's blood, but yes there were Romans and Jews involved in His murder, even as there were Romans and Jews who followed and loved Him. Nothing would be served by trying to pretend otherwise.Comparisons to earlier adaptations of the life of Christ are inevitable but not necessarily appropriate. Most of the other films cover not merely the Passion story but the whole of His birth, life, ministry and resurrection. This film focuses almost entirely on Christ's death. For the whole story, a movie like the also excellent Jesus of Nazareth might be more appropriate, or perhaps the recent Gospel of John (which also looks outstanding, but this reviewer has not seen it yet). But The Passion stands alone in portraying the awful power of Christ's sacrifice in all its terrible enormity.If there is one thing about the movie I would have liked to have seen handled a little differently, it is the Resurrection itself. Though present, it is primarily an epilogue. While uplifting and comforting, after all that has gone before a little more screen time for this event might have been justified.No, this is not light fare. This is a movie that can make you cry, groan, and grieve. It is not a fun movie. It will challenge you and make you think. Adult Christians (and perhaps mature teens)should see it to be inspired and reminded of what Christ endured for them. Non-Christians should see it to better understand what Christianity is about and who Jesus really is. But for whatever reason, *see it*. Not for Mel Gibson, not for any reviewer, and not because of the controversey. See it because this is a movie that can change your life.

Jesus revealed God as the Father of each human being and when once you grasp this idea of God as a true and loving Father, the ONLY concept which Jesus ever taught, you must forthwith, in all consistency, utterly abandon all those primitive notions about God as an offended monarch, a stern and all-powerful ruler whose chief delight is to detect his subjects in wrongdoing and to see that they are adequately punished unless some being almost equal to himself should volunteer to suffer for them, to die as a substitute and in their place. The whole idea of ransom and atonement is incompatible with the concept of God as it was taught and exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth. The infinite love of God is not secondary to anything in the divine nature. Even if God were the stern and legal monarch of a universe in which justice ruled supreme, He certainly would not be satisfied with the childish scheme of substituting an innocent sufferer for a guilty offender! The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive. What a travesty upon the infinite character of God, this teaching that His fatherly heart in all its austere coldness and hardness was so untouched by the misfortunes and sorrows of His creatures that His tender mercies were not forthcoming until He saw His blameless Son bleeding and dying upon the cross of Calvary!

I even got into a discussion about it via email with someone who didn't think we should. Going only reenforced my belief that it transcends denominational boundaries.It is easy, especially with the picture portrails of the crucifixion, to get a prettied up picture of what happened in our minds.

Parry,"[10, 13]","Although my husband and I do not affiliate ourselves with any organized religion, we were very curious to see The Passion, even to the point of seeing it opening weekend. Living in a place where the Bible seems to be the only book than anyone reads, we knew we needed to see the film so we could formulate an opinion, and rather than just formulating it on word-of-mouth, we chose to see the movie immediately. Plus, Braveheart is one of my all-time favorite films, so I knew that a film directed by Mel Gibson would be great, regardless of subject matter.Despite the fact that my Biblical understanding is sketchy at best, I found myself engrossed in this film. The fact that Gibson chose to have the actors speak their lines in Aramaic and Latin was, to me, a very wise choice. Several times I have seen previews of movies set in certain countries or certain times, and not only are people speaking English, they are speaking English with American accents, which detracts from the whole point of the film. This sounds weird to say, but after a while I forgot I was reading subtitles. And the two languages were beautiful.It's been several hours since I left the theater and I still feel extremely moved by the experience of watching The Passion. The fact that Jesus held onto his convictions until the bitter end, even through all of the horrible scourging and beating and crucifixion shows the extreme depth of his character. Again, for a person who is very unfamiliar with the Bible, it was admirable to me to see that Jesus was honest about his identity and his abilities even though he knew it would send him to certain death.The cinematography of this film is beautiful, if graphic at many times. But Gibson, who is no stranger to extreme violence in films (if anyone has seen Payback they know what I'm talking about), knows the exact times to give the audience an out; just as I thought I was seeing too much of this, and I wanted to just look away, he would insert a flashback to earlier times in Jesus' life, or he would focus back on Mary & Mary Magdalene and their suffering in watching Jesus' ordeal.Some people have addressed the extreme violence in this movie, intimating that it is excessive. Well, considering the brutality of the Roman Empire, I would not be entirely surprised if the actual event had been more horrendous. We most likely were still watching a sanitized version of the event, although this was more graphic than any other previous depiction.My only complaint about The Passion is the fact that Gibson seems to assume that everyone watching the movie is familiar with the story; he seems to feel that no real explanation of what's going on is necessary. Some may argue that to go into all this detail would involve making a four-hour film, but I do not agree. All it would have really involved was maybe extending some of the flashback scenes: explain why Judas was in such a financial crunch that he was willing to sell Jesus' location for a mere 30 coins. Explain why Mary Magdalene was being stoned. Show a little bit more of the conflict that I understand Jesus went through before his capture- this was eluded to in his prayer scene in Gethsemane with Satan, but a little more background would have been helpful. Even if Gibson planned this purely as a vehicle to get more people to read the Bible and go to church, he should have addressed these matters just to make a more complete film.Having said that, I still feel that this movie is something every adult should experience, regardless of religious affiliation. Whether you believe in God or not, or whether you believe that Jesus was truly God's son or not, whether you believe that Jesus died for man's sins or not, the fact remains that Jesus DID exist, Jesus DID die this horrible, horrible death for his beliefs and his preachings, and we SHOULD learn something from this, even though many of us do not. Jesus died because people couldn't handle his message; he rocked the boat a little too much for the establishment's comfort. Although most of the world seems to think that they are upholding Jesus through their religious beliefs, the fact remains that people are still being persecuted (although most of the time not nearly as violently) for having different beliefs. That is, if anything is, the true sin.As a very important note: do NOT take children to see this movie. Regardless of your or your family's religious affiliation this would be an EXTREMELY traumatic film for children to see. I know people out there are saying that there is much more violence in films right now, but this is violence on a very different level; most of the guns and sword-fighting variety of violence in films now are very sanitized compared to The Passion. Nothing is left to the imagination: a cat-o-nine-tails sticks in Jesus' flesh at one point, and violently rips off his flesh, exposing ribs, and the viewer sees all of this. Even Mel Gibson said that this is not a kid's movie; and to be perfectly honest I think the MPAA should have rated the film NC-17. Copious amounts of blood are shed from this one poor individual, and children absolutely SHOULD NOT see this until they are AT LEAST 15 or 16! Please, if you choose to teach your children religion, teach it through church/synagogue/temple or through reading or prayer, NOT through this film.",5,"Excellent, moving film-review from a non-religious reviewer",1077926400,"02 28, 2004",-0.0379

We recieved it for christmas from the kids, who said it was a great movie. It is. I believe that Mr. Gibson was attempting to make a historical movie, not so much a religious one. Jesus was never a threat to the Roman Empire, and there is a question as to whether Ceasar even knew who he was. Pilate, who over the last couple centuries has been the villain in this sad tale, was actually a poor schmuck caught in an impossible political situation, with his head literally on the line if he made the wrong choice. I cannot condemn the Jewish heirarchy for their fears either, they saw more and more of their followers beginning to leave their faith and embrace this new Messiah's teachings, some of which did not comply with their accepted codes. Very scary in those days. If what Jesus said is true, then this all had to happen...one way or another..so no one could have prevented it.As to the blood and gore.....well not many people fully realized what scourging was until it was depicted in this film. Now they do. It was a horrifying and ugly punishment, and many people died from even a moderate scourging, but it was a common practice in those times. Very few people went to prison in those days, except to await sentencing, your punishment was meted out physically or you were put to death. Believe me, if you do study history, you'll find much worse punishments than scourging and crucifixon. Check out Asia for inovative tortures and ugly death.I thought the film did a great job developing characters, and trying to truly capture the events that happend so long ago. As to Mr. Gibson reaping the gold, well he earned it. He spent his own money to make this film, wouldn't compromise on the quality of any part of it, went to great lengths to make it historically accurate and has endured a great deal of abuse for it.

It combines fine acting, good cinematography, truely disturbing though not pointless imagery, and even a couple of ancient languages (Latin and Aramaic). It also got a lot of Christians thinking more about their Lord's sufferings. On the whole these were the good parts and I recommend the film though it is suitable only for mature audiences.The film is not perfect historically and I think it may have some theological weaknesses as well. For instance, Greek should have been employed in the film and Christ was likely nailed to a Tau cross (T) rather than a Latin cross (t). Dr. Zugibe does a nice but short critique of the film in his book The Crucifixion of Jesus: Second Edition. Theologically, I think this film may make Christians look too much at Christ's physical sufferings. After all, crucifixion is often considered one of the worst forms of execution but there are others likely as bad or worse. Even regarding crucifixion, many men, women, and children have sadly died on crosses. What made Christ's sufferings unique was the spiritual atoning angle, not purely physical pain. That said, that may be imposible to capture well in a film so I should perhaps let Gibson off the hook there.

Some people are bound to hate it for the violence of it, some will be put off by the fact that the film is totally subtitled. And some will not like it because Mr. Gibson is accused of being an Anti-Semite. And most of those people will not have even seen the film. Which is a shame...I'd heard all the hype, read some of what some critics had to say and then I did what some people on line and off line who have been chatting about this film refuse to do. I went out and saw it for myself. According to some critics this film is anti-Semitic, according to some it is too violent, in that the depiction of Christ's torture is too graphic.On the former: being anti-Semitic. I didn't get that feeling from the film, nor I dare say did the people who surrounded me in the theater. The film was about a small group of priests trying to protect their power base which Jesus and his teachings threatened. It is clearly shown in the film that during the trial anyone who stood up for Jesus including some of the other priests (who were also Jewish) where ejected from the proceedings. And there are several scenes in which there are crowds of people weeping for Jesus(also Jewish). There is a scene in which Veronica (also Jewish) comes to wipe the face of Jesus and is knocked way by Roman soldiers. The film also makes a point of having Jesus say that no man takes his life but that he willingly lays it down. I think for this film to stir feelings of anti-Semitism one would have had to walked into the film an anti-Semite. And that to me has nothing to do with the film, and everything to do with a personal decision made long before this film was even a conception in come cases.The point is that if you're a Christian than the film is saying that we all are responsible for the death of Christ in that it was our sin that made it necessary for God to require a sacrifice, and for the sacrifice to be made. The film is a tool in which we are shown that Christ's death wasn't this antiseptic death, where he was hit once or twice, whipped and then nailed to the cross where he just died. This films is showing us that he was beaten, and the whip they used had nails and bone, and glass in it, which is historically correct when it comes to devices that the Romans used in chastising prisoners. This kind of beating was meant to destroy the body, it was meant as a form of torture in itself. Which leads me to.....The latter: the graphic violence. Well I really don't understand some people's objection in that there are movies out there with more gratuitous violence. And the violence has been mindless and played for thrills, or to see just how much the director can gross the audience out, because they certainly have gotten past the point of actually trying to scare people anymore. There are video games that advocate shooting people and stealing their cars. Television is a wash with show after show depicting death in the most violent of ways. There are shows that show us the path of a bullet as it enters the body, shows that show us bones breaking on the impact of a blunt object. We're fed a steady diet of these violent acts that seem to have no value to it other than to shock us, or to draw us in to make us watch.In this film however the violence isn't there to gross us out, or for shock value. But it's there as a reminder of the sacrifice made by an innocent for the sins of all men. The violence in this film is there to depict the level of love that Christ had for us in going to the cross. It's about showing that we as a race and not just differing ethic groups are capable of this level of violence and so incredibly much more. That we as a race of people can look back over our vast history and see it has been peppered with individual and societal acts of violence that make what we see in this film pale in comparison. And yet for all of our ungratefulness Christ came here and willingly went to the cross knowing well in advance what would be done to him. Which is why in the garden at the very beginning of the film Jesus asks that if it be God's well to let this bitter cup pass from him. It has to be a horrifying thing to not only know that you're going to die, but to know in detail the manner in which you are going to die. And to know you are suffering and dying an innocent man. Not only that but to know that your most trusted friends are to betray you and deny ever knowing you.I've done my research on the subject of crucifixion. And it wasn't a sanitary from of death, it was torture. It was done because it was one of the most painful ways to die, and people got to watch your agony. The point was to make you suffer, and to draw that suffering out over a long period of time. The only reason to break the legs of a convicted criminal was to make death faster, because the weight of your body would finally suffocate you.So yes the violence of the beating, and the violence of the crucifixion was indeed very graphic. But then what the Romans did when beating criminals and crucifying people was very graphic. And shouldn't be sanitized because some people don't like it.When I saw this film there were a lot of tears not only mine but there wasn't a dry eye in the theater. Not one.And that alone should tell you the powerful impact the film has.If nothing else The Passion of the Christ has sparked conversation.

Everyone around me was crying - it felt like we were all tuned in to the proceedings of a televised execution. I was a little confused by the time it was all over & as I was leaving the theater, I was even more so: I saw parents walking out with their children. Jesus Christ's teachings were left in the wings, the significance of his life locked out of the script almost entirely. Hardly a first impression for young children. The ONLY things I found at all interesting about the PASSION OF THE CHRIST: the use of the authentic languages from the time period (Latin & Aramaic) and the actors bringing this movie to life. James Caviezel's performance in Terrence Malick's THE THIN RED LINE was simply mesmerizing, and he used a similar pallet of emotion for his performance here. I was raised a Roman Catholic - so viewing the Stations of the Cross was nothing new to me. To suggest this film version of that seasonal meditation is a masterwork - simply is absurd.So what WAS the point of this film, what were we to draw from its brutal imagery? There was no inspiration in Mel Gibson's film for me, no arc of understanding - only suffering and death. Which led me to consider their goal may have been to create a vivid emotional experience, intended to lift us out of numbness and inspire reflection on faith to get us through this life: televised warfare, beheadings on the internet, stories of sickness and shootings on the nightly news, etc. Perhaps, but I don't think so. A fleeting, knee-jerk reaction with some tears shed on queue, and then those emotions are safely placed back on the shelf until the next time. Complicity and silence have always gone hand in hand: it's easy to damn this world, condemn what we see as different from our own huddled beliefs; allow selfishness and insincerity to decimate through clouds of frankincense and joyous hymns. Salvation? Maybe.The infamous THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, directed by Martin Scorsese, is a masterwork of filmmaking. The film not only inspires the heart, but also prods the mind. I could feel the breath of those images, allowing me to enter the world it created and truly feel something more than myself. It was not an epiphany; it was a fresh view, it was an enlightened dream of another world, yet strangely our own. The film didn't plague the audience with blood and horrors; it dramatizes the passion and relevance of the story. I've come to understand and believe Jesus Christ to be among the greatest teachers this world has known, who suffered the tortures of the damned to inspire his vision of peace, determination for truth and humility in us all - ideals that have taken a back seat to robotic, indignant servitude to skewed moral interests.The LAST TEMPTATION was based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis - from which the filmmakers created a thoughtful, passionate re-examination of one of the greatest stories ever told. Mr. Scorsese, in his youth, had almost joined the priesthood; but chose to explore and express his passion through the cinema. I saw no blasphemy in his images - only a powerful film exploring faith in ourselves and the world. Often cited as trash, garbage and against popular faith - this film truly offers a story of FAITH we can all profit from, regardless of what we believe.",1,Life beyond the thunderdome,1105920000,"01 17, 2005",0.1869

It is the mystery upon which the Christian religeon is founded. Christ was divine but simultaneously, human. So he was 'the way' but he also knew what was in store for him. The references to 'the new covenant' at the Last Supper . . . if you don't know about the prior covenants at Mount Sinai, or the Davidic Covenant (From your loins shall spring Kings) of thousands of years earlier, you can't see the forest for the trees that Christ and the Old Testament come together as one story.So what is the mystery is that he was Divine, knew what was going to happen, and as a human, really wanted to avoid it. And, even more difficult to grasp, he was there to die for our sins. Our present sins. Our past sins. Our future sins. This is not an aberrant thought. It had been going on since the time of the the captivity in Egypt. Jesus says to the High Priest in the first interrogation in response to the question 'who are you?' he says I AM. This is what he tells Moses thousands of years earlier. I AM.So what Gibson is doing is to show people that Christ knew he was going to suffer, and that his suffering was human and extraordinarily agonizing.It's hard to rate in the conventional sense. Is it a great movie? Perhaps the greatest. Will you want to see it again? Probably not. Should Gibson be given accolades? Most certainly.

541,A2NJO6YE954DBH,310263662,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[14, 20]","There is a well-known Christian song that asks &quot;Were you there when they crucified my Lord?&quot; What that meant has never been as graphically displayed in a film before as in Mel Gibson's &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot; The scouring of Jesus is pivotal part of this film and its emphasis is justified by the fact that Jesus only lasted a few hours on the cross. Victims of crucifixion usually lasted days, able to gain brief respite from the physical agony by pushing themselves upwards, which causes create pain in the feet, where nails have been driven through the arches. This is why breaking the legs of the thieves would hasten their deaths: hanging by their arms their pectoral muscles would become paralyzed and eventually the lung and heart stop working well enough to continue. Hanging by his arms, the pectoral muscles are paralyzed and the intercostal muscles are unable to act. If Jesus only lasted a few hours on the cross, then he must have been badly beaten, a point that will be seared into the mind of every viewer who watches &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot;The most serious concern I have with this film is that on a couple of points Gibson decides to veer away from his commitment to providing the most accurate depiction of these events ever seen to fall back on tradition. Although the two thieves are correctly show carrying only their cross-arms (the patibulum, which weighed about 100 pounds) through the streets of Jerusalem, Jesus once again has to carry the entire cross. Then when Jesus is nailed to the cross the nails are place in the palm of his hands instead of through the natural opening made by the small bones of the wrists (radial and ulna). One of the reasons the Shroud of Turin is considered an accurate depiction of a crucified Jesus is that the nail wounds are in the proper place. Given the violence of putting the cross into position, the hands would have been ripped right through the palms of the hand. I suspect the reason for this deviation is that Gibson was brought up with such images, codified by most depictions of the crucified Christ and the Stations of the Cross (twelve of the fourteen traditional Station are depicted: omitted are Jesus meeting the women of Jerusalem and his burial).I certainly do not consider &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; to be anti-Semitic, mainly because both of the races depicted in the film are shown as having &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; members. Granted, only the motivation for the actions of Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) are explored; Caiphas (Mattia Sbragia) and Judas (Luca Lionello) both play out their parts without any clear reason why they are playing the parts they play. A better case can be made that the Roman soldiers were probably not as cruel and stupid as they were shown here (they should have realized sooner to back off on the whipping or they were going to kill Jesus before they had the chance to nail him to a cross). Yet all of these choices are certainly within the scope of the story related in the Gospels.Gibson's Catholicism seems to come through more in his portrayal of the Mary, the mother of Jesus. Maia Morgenstern provides what for me were the two most emotionally compelling moments in the film. The first is when Jesus rises to his feet after the first whipping session when mother and son exchange a look of understanding. The second is when Mary sees her son fall on his way to Golgatha and has a flashback. Along with another flashback of Jesus and Mary, when he was still only a carpenter, &quot;The Passion&quot; presents the most realized version of the Virgin Mary we have ever seen.The other part of the film that really stood out for me because it was equally unexpected given the film's focus on the Passion, was James Caviezel's portryal of Jesus in a series of brief flashbacks. I liked seeing a compassionate and charismatic Jesus doing part of the Sermon on the Mount, as well as one who could laugh with his mother over his latest project as a carpenter. The emphasis in this film is on the realism of the Passion and the crucifixion, but I can make a case that this realism extends to the brief depictions of Jesus' life and ministry as well.Gibson takes license with the story recorded in the Gospels in several ways, with mixed results. I like the silent flashback to one of my favorite stories of Jesus ministry (John 8:7), although once again it is tradition rather than historical or scriptural evidence that makes the adulteress to be Mary Magdalene. The use of Satan (Rosalinda Celentano) was overdone to no great effect, but the one part that I would strongly argue went too far was the bit with the black bird during the crucifixion simply because I do not buy that God would engage in such a petty act at that time. However I found what Judas was doing to himself between the betrayal and his suicide to be an effective addition. I also see a bit of the medieval drama &quot;The York Crucifixion&quot; in the scene where a Roman has to get Jesus' second arm into position to be nailed to the cross, adding another inspirational source for this script by Gibson and Benedict Fitzgerald.Gibson's masterful publicity campaign for &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; resulted in more pre-ticket sales than any other film in history. But the success the film now enjoys is because of what is on the screen and not what was in the media. This is a provocative film, because in addition to demanding a gut reaction to the violence depicted on the screen it compels the audience to engage mentally as well.",5,"&quot;See, mother, I make all things new...&quot;",1078617600,"03 7, 2004",0.0986

It is definitely a realistic portrayl of what Jesus had to go through for us. Watching this movie, in a way, has brought me closer to Jesus, and it really left an impact on me. It's a very heavy movie, however, and very difficult to watch. I don't like to see people getting hurt, so seeing Jesus get hurt was especially hard for me. But it really shows you how much Jesus loves and cares for us all by taking the burden of sin for us.

The movie was not called &#34;The Resurrection of Christ&#34; but instead &#34;The Passion&#34;--the resurrection is for a different story. I'm sorry if you find me to be a heretic, but the movie was one of the heaviest, saddest, and most poignant emotional experiences until that ending--to me, it felt like Gibson tacked on a 'happy' ending for the sake of frightened audiences. I know how die-hard Christians feel about that ending, but to me it just seemed to undermine Christ's suffering (I'm speaking in terms of the movie guys). But other than these quibbles, I thought the movie was very moving, very violent (not nearly as bad as critics like Roger Ebert made it out to be--it's about suffering, geez), and very deeply felt. At first I was skeptical of Gibson's take on this material, but I'm glad that I watched it. I was very impressed with his style. J. C.'s performance as J. C. was absolutely stunning, and the guy was struck down by lightning on the set for Christ's sake! He is a wonderfully endearing actor. This movie kicked up a big stink at the time of its release, but soon it will continue to fall away to the dustbin of history when the spiritual orgasms over its violence have subsided. I didn't feel guilt at the end, but rather a deep and forbidding sorrow--this is a really sad movie, and I like it for that reason. Even nonbelievers will be touched, if only they will put aside their prejudices long enough to watch it. I did, and I enjoyed it--if enjoy is the right word for this kind of controversial, &#34;be careful what you say about it&#34; movie.The BluRay set is fantastic.

The picture itself is very good, widescreen, and very effective in appearance.You may not agree with Gibson about his personal interpretations about the subject of Jesus all the time. But that's not the point in liking this film--for everything I thought was wrong with the film, Gibson has at least managed to present Jesus as a thoroughly ascetic hero, which goes a long way towards redemption for me, because today's family-oriented Christians want nothing to do with the pure ascetic life.

The performances from Jim Caviezl and the woman who played his mother, Mary...no doubt nominations for the Academy Award.I wondered if it would be anti-semetic and I watch with an open mind and heart and it was not.

While many depictions of Christ show different aspects of his life, some concentrating on the early years and some focusing on the preaching or the miracles, this movie takes a very specific part and plays it out. The actual beating and torture are filmed in real time. So for people feeling like the amount of lashes were overdone or that there were no other aspects of Jesus's life are not living the actual journey of feeling what Jesus endured. To pace the movie like you were witnessing the torture is a unique approach to a movie. If this were the first or only movie ever produce on the life of Christ, fine. But it is not. I think what Mel Gibson was trying to achieve was to give the viewer a journey into living the moments up to the crucifiction If you were a bystander back on that particular day, than this is probably what you would have witnessed and felt. To tell the story any other way would not have achieved this goal. If you are looking for other dimensions to Christ's life, then buy Jesus of Nazerath or some other production. I for one felt compelled to watch every moment of the torture to appreciate what a human being, the son of God or not, endured for his beliefs. Like Shindlers list or video from 9/11, watching this is like paying tribute to those who suffered and died. It is not the kind of movie you would want to watch over and over.

552,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,310263662,Linda Linguvic,"[8, 11]","Clearly, this is the most brutal film I have ever seen. And, frankly, if the subject matter was not such a hallowed one, it is doubtful that Hollywood would have ever let it be made. Mel Gibson has created this epic, depicting the last 12 hours of Christ's life on earth, as an act of faith. Whether or not it is true to the gospels is for biblical scholars to decide. I'm just a film buff, and a Jewish one at that, who was anxious to see the film because of all the buzz.O.K. Acting and cinematography and marketing were all done well. But this film is more than about those things. It's about the central idea of the Christian faith. And perhaps Christian viewers who saw this film were inspired. I guess I naively thought that if I saw it I would come away with some insight about the central theme of Christianity. That didn't happen. Actually, I found the plot extremely difficult to follow and, with the exception of the 90% of the film devoted to the torture of Christ, it wasn't clear to me what was going on. As a matter of fact, there were some parts that made me wonder if some of it was actually in the bible.For example, one of the early scenes shows Christ and a woman shortly before he is arrested. I guess she's supposed to be the Satan or the forces of evil. We're supposed to understand that she's a bad guy because there's a worm coming out of her nose and later there's a serpent springing at Jesus. This woman shows up throughout the film, floating, instead of walking around, especially during the scenes where Jesus is being beaten. This flogging is perhaps the longest part of the film. And this is not a simple beating. The cruel soldiers are large and laugh at his pain. He is whipped first with sticks and then irons with cruel hooks on them. His flesh is literally pulled from his body. It goes on and on and on and on. And the audience sees every stroke and every wound on his body over and over and over again in living color and in vivid close-ups. Tears came to my eyes just from the horror and the suffering of it all. And we hadn't even gotten to the crucifixion yet.The dialog was in Aramaic and Latin. Some of it wasn't translated. But it was clear that the soldiers, too, were the bad guys. Maybe they were just doing their jobs. But they were bad guys because they enjoyed it so much.The crowd of people who called for Jesus' death were bad guys too. I guess they were Jews. But so were Jesus' mother and all the disciples. Judas who told the authorities where Jesus was hiding for 30 pieces of silver was also a bad guy. But he got his comeuppance when he felt guilt and then was chased by a group of children whose faces turned to evil using the best of Hollywood's computer distortion techniques.It never was clear to me who was who and some of the plot confused me. John was shown with Mary and kept calling her Mother. If I didn't know better I would have thought that he was Jesus' brother. And again, if I didn't know better I would have though Mary Magdalene was Jesus' sister until a short flashback showed her wearing long earrings and being saved by Jesus from being stoned to death. It was also never really clear why the crowd wanted Jesus to die.One of the best roles, as written, was given to Pontius Pilate. He, alone, had some choice in the matter. Even the King, Herod, had found no crime that Jesus had committed. So Pontius Pilate had a choice, as governor of the area, whether or not to condemn Jesus to death. Here was a conflicted man who had to make a choice. He gave in to the crowd though instead of following his own conscience. And the way his scenes were written, it was understandable why he made that choice.Sooner or later, all that depiction of suffering becomes numbing. I couldn't wait for the film to end. And even though there were some brief flashbacks, I would have liked to see more about Jesus' life, not his death. Also, for someone without a Christian background I still don't understand why he had to go through all that suffering. I also wonder if an earthquake really occurred at the moment of his death, splitting the palace in two and destroying a temple. And I wonder if, by making this a Hollywood spectacular, this particular film didn't somehow take away from each believing Christian his or her own personal version of what actually happened. Surely, the film it is a landmark that will forever be imbedded in people's minds as the actual truth. However, it is in reality just one man, Mel Gibson's version of this most influential story in the Christian world.The Passion of the Christ is a disturbing film. I hated watching the torture. I felt uncomfortable not really understanding. However, I did not come away with a feeling of it being anti-Semitic. I would never ever recommend this film for children. As for adults, however, I think it is an important film. I hold back on recommending it to anyone though. The choice is entirely personal.",4,"Will be long remembered as the actual truth, not just a film",1082678400,"04 23, 2004",-0.1483
553,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,310263662,Lisa Shea be the change you wish to see in t...,"[12, 28]","Mel Gibson poured millions of his own money into creating this movie, and spent incredible amounts of time researching the historical accuracy of every detail. In that sense you can say the movie is the child of Passion of the Christ, which had previously raised the bar in historical accuracy of Biblical movies. Gibson even went so far as to film the entire movie in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew, the languages of the time. Mel's vision was to document the last 12 hours of Jesus' life in excruciating detail, using the Gospels and historic research to make this as accurate as possible. There are minor problems - like nailing the hands instead of the wrists, and the Romans speaking Latin instead of the more common Greek - but most is very well done.It would have been a very interesting film if he had done this task in a traditional manner - having the last supper, having the scene with Pilate, having the crucifixion. We've seen all of those scenes done before, many times. We know them and understand them. The key issue that made this movie so incredibly controversial was the amount of GORE involved in Mel's vision. In addition, many Jews felt uncomfortable that the movie made them culpable for Jesus' death.Let's take the second issue first. Jesus did in fact rail against the current Jewish powers many times. Remember, he was a Jew himself! He was raised in the Jewish fashion. He was taught to follow those laws. But he felt many of those in power has corrupted the laws. It is like modern Catholics taking a stand against priests who rape children. Jesus wasn't saying all Jews are evil. He was saying You who do these certain practices should stop. Naturally, those who were in power took steps to protect their power. All Jews who exist in modern times aren't responsible for the actions of those leaders 2,000 years ago. It's something that happened in ancient times.I don't find the movie to be an indictment against all current Jews, any more than all current Christians are individually responsible for the horrors of the Inquisition. All religions had leaders at some point who did bad things. We can't erase history and pretend it didn't happen. We learn about it, we understand it, and then we do better in the future.So, on to the gore part. First, I think we can all agree that crucifixion was a horrible way to die. There's been plenty of research on it - on the foot-rest and bottom-rest that helped ensure that the victim didn't asphyxiate immediately but rather lived in agony for days - to know that this was a public display of absolute agony. And as if that wasn't enough, they would beat the person very severely first, so that they were in pain before they even went onto the cross.To see anybody going through this process would be incredibly heart-wrenching to watch. To see someone go through it who did it *willingly*, in order to save all of mankind, is of course even more powerful. I accept that, and understand how meaningful it is to those who believe in the message of love and peace that Jesus was trying to spread. It would be like seeing Martin Luther King, or Gandhi, tortured in slow motion for 3 hours straight.That all being said, the truth of the situation was bad enough, without having to exaggerate it. It was like watching a Kurosawa film at times, with the huge amount of blood involved. It got to the point where you began to think, You must be kidding! That is a real shame, because most of us accept that Jesus was a historical person who went through this, whether or not he was a messiah. This was a truly awful punishment he went through. It should be appreciated as such, not overdone.A side problem with turning the punishment part of the movie into such an overly violent one is that kids cannot see the movie. The story, with its authentic setting, languages and well done acting, could have been incredibly powerful for kids to see. As it stands, the movie would give them nightmares for months. Jesus didn't preach psychologically scarring children and young adults. He preached love and gentleness.You could propose the argument that Mel should have filmed all of Jesus' life, not just the last 12 hours. Maybe he should have filmed the last 12 days. But of course, any director who makes a movie chooses what to make the movie of. Mel chose the last 12 hours. Since that is what he wanted to focus on, that's what he did. We as viewers have to accept that. There are certainly enough other movies that cover the other time periods. However, if Mel IS going to take on the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, it would have made sense to have those 12 hours be shown in a meaningful manner - that is, tell the story of the events that happened in those 12 hours, and why they were important.Instead, it's almost as if, to Mel, the volumes of blood pouring out were the only story. The other characters around the blood are pretty two dimensional. There are crying people, there are laughing people, there are impassive people. There is Jesus, in incredible pain, and there is blood. It's not a story as much as a bloodfest. It's not watching a movie as much as watching a documentary of someone being tortured for multiple hours. And again, it's not even a documentary - it's a very exaggerated portrayal of that activity.Surely we could appreciate the pains that Jesus went through just as much with a realistic portrayal. Also, surely those pains would have had even more meaning if they were given a context. If we could have seen more interaction between Jesus and the Jewish leaders, between him and the apostles, between Judas and the others. In the time span given, Jesus didn't do much. He didn't have a choice. He just lay there writhing while pain was inflicted on him. It's not really that he willingly took the pain. He *helplessly* took the pain, like a newborn puppy. That's not beneficial to watch - it's desensitizing.To say you must endure multiple hours of excessive gore to understand Christ is like saying you must watch multiple hours of graphic child rape scenes to understand why child rape is bad. There's a reason that soldiers often come back from war and don't want to talk about the experience. It's truly awful. They went through it to keep the rest of us safe. They have serious psychological problems as a result. We don't show people graphic documentaries of our friends and families being horribly mutilated in order to understand the soldiers' issues. Yes, I realize crucifixion is awful, I realize the pre-crucifixion beatings were nasty. But to make that the only message of a multi-hour movie, when so much *meaningful* content happened during that time period and was ignored, seems to be quite against what Jesus himself preached. He preached love, forgiveness and peace. This movie is soaked in blood, and embeds violent, graphically gory visual images in the viewers' heads.

If you are a Christian with a good knowledge of the Gospels, then the answer will be NO. But if you are just taking the movie alone by its content, with no knowledge of the Gospels, then the answer is YES. (Non-Christians would regard this film as anti-Semitic.)Is the movie historically authentic? To a point, yes it is to a limited point. After all its a Hollywood production type of film. First point, while it nice to heard Latin and Aramaic spoken, you also needs to put Greek in there since that was the universal language like English is today. Second point, old Hollywood trick of using white people to play ancient Semitic is like using white people to play Indians in old John Wayne films. Entertaining but its not history. One of the previous reviewers stated that Jews were Caucasians, maybe today but not back in the first century AD. Semitic people are not Caucasians!!! Third point have to be the cross. Romans used a T cross, Mr. Gibson, not the Latin cross. But Hollywood embellishment is okay I supposed for personal creativity.

I guess I can say more but it would pointless after the tenth page or so.The movie proves to be totally gory and utterly unrealistic. No man on earth can take the punishment movie Jesus took from the Romans and still be standing. (Unless you are Rambo!!) Remember folks, He don't become divine until after He have risen. Until then, He was fresh and blood like you and I. Turning Him into a hunk of beef and then having Him carry that cross is beyond any human ability.But the cruxification scene was well done. Wrong cross but overall, it was the best part of the movie.The movie could be better if Mel Gibson considered Jesus as a man and as a redeemer instead of some victim of sadistic initiation into Godhood.

It is an excellent film with incredible artistic and realistic values often portrayed in all great epics, and is a must-see film for all!Despite the controversial anti-Semitic allegations, we held a special screening the day before the film's release nationwide, and invited many Jews. All of them were extremely moved and emotionally distraught because they had no idea how horrific the crucifixion really was. But, none of them felt the film was at all anti-Semitic. One gentleman even stated that he could see how the Jewish religious leaders and many Jews were responsible for the literal suffering of Jesus, but he also took note that there were many other Jews portrayed in the film who were distraught over Jesus' suffering and the brutality inflicted upon Him by the Romans. He answered the allegations of anti-Semitism with this: You can't blame the entire race for the inflictions caused by a few...It would be like blaming every white person for the suffering of the black slaves during the Civil War era. Not everyone can be responsible for the act of a few.This movie is by far the most incredible and realistic depiction of Christ's last twelve hours, filled with incredible performances by Jim Caviezel and Mya Morgenstern, who portrays Jesus' mother, Mary. While the film's obvious focus is on those last twelve hours of Christ, Mel Gibson does an incredible job of also telling the story of Mary's heartbreak as she endures tremendous maternal suffering, following her son to the cross. Every parent could completely relate to Mary's own suffering and how horrified she must have felt.On the darker side, an often forgotten character is added to the storyline as satan is introduced as the tempter in the Garden of Gethsemane and often appears during the suffering and torment of Christ, which is an interesting addition to the story.Overall, this film is definitely not for children under the age of 12, and parental discretion is absolutely advised. But, be sure to purchase the DVD when it comes out and share it with those same children when they get older. It is a must-see for everyone in order to appreciate the true meaning of sacrifice, grace, and love. Go see it in the theatre for the full impact of the film, and don't wait for the DVD. Unless you have a huge screen TV, you will most likely miss some of the incredible impact when it is reduced to a smaller size. So, go see it while it's in theaters.

Quido quidrock,"[5, 14]","A moving, if somewhat over-the-top score, amazing cinematography, the mystical strength of having the film spoken in the ancient languages, and a brilliant execution by a fine ensemble of performers.........all of this is quickly forgotten as the filmgoer tries to make sense of how much carnage and how many unspeakable close-ups of torture fill the screen. Devout Christians are supposed to view the film and let Christ's suffering intensify their faith.Well, in my view, the story of Christ's last days is one of compassion, sorrow and inspiration for the sacrifice our Lord makes for his people. The focus of this film seems less to inspire, than to sensationalize the rituals of punishment of the first century. Gibson creates a hell on earth, a sort of sadistic, closely filmed depiction of Christ's suffering, which overshadows some of the deep poignance of the movie -- his relationships with his Mother and his followers, Christ at prayer, the Last Supper.Gibson shrugs it off by pointing to the fact that the ritual of crucifixion was real, the violence occurred. If he is presenting reality according to the Gospels -- why the invention of the confrontation with Satan at Gethesemene, why the depiction of children as demons? There are too many areas where Gibson allowed his own view of history to creep into the screenplay for him to play the reality card with what amounts to gratuitous violence.There is much in Gibson's film to be praised, much that inspires awe, but as a believer and a Catholic, I feel that he built too much melodrama into the film, and spent too little time putting the film into the context of Christ's entire time on earth. That said, there was an enormity of feeling in the theater as the credits rolled -- definitely shock and awe. I commend Gibson for speaking out about his vision, but I feel that artistically he failed to balance the message of his film.3 stars.",3,"Intensity, not inspiration.",1077926400,"02 28, 2004",0.0221

It just ended with Jesus getting out of the grave, for goodness sakes! I didn't want to give any sort of negative comments, but the ending was really disappointing and the direction of the movie should have gone on to show more of Jesus' life after His resurrection. They should have done more, like they did on the mini-series about Christ and his resurrection that came on NBC 3 years ago during easter. Nevertheless, I thought that it was good that they were showcasing a movie about Jesus Christ and His life because the world needs to be exposed to God and religious material like this. The only thing is that it was too violent and gory; all those beatings and wipings made me jump every time it happened in the movie. I even had to cover my sister's eyes because the beating scenes were so gruesome and graphic. But it shows the length that Christ went to just to save humanity and restore redemption to a fallen world, and how important He is and should be. From the scenes in the garden of Gethsemane to His trial before Pilate, His premonition that he would be betrayed by the same disciples who swore their loyalty to the crucifixion, the movie accurately reflected biblical scripture in the life that Jesus lived.

One could quibble with him here and there with the period details, but for the most parts they are spot-on, including the use of Aramaic and Latin, and the costume design and art direction. What is more controversial is Gibson's choice of violence, used throughout the film, as Christ is being scourged and flayed to such a degree as to bleed the screen red all the time. Did the Gospel portray such a bloody killing? No one knows, but scientifically one has to suspend disbelief as any human being would have died long ago from such beatings, unless one is -- as possibly from Gibson's viewpoint -- miraculously conceived to suffer. James Caviezel's Christ is a mute disfigurement of a person -- one who is born to endure than do anything else; depending on one's interpretation of the Gospels, this may either a travesty or an enlightenment of Christ's mission.Gibson's film raises important theological questions for anyone who watches the movie. Gibson claims that he is not attacking the Jewish community, but his portrayal is misleading -- he takes away one important speech (it is better for one man to suffer than for the whole nation to do so) and categorizes Caiaphas into a bloodthirsty high priest, changing certain key moments (including Peter's denial of Jesus, which does not happen here in a courtyard). Other violent scenes are gratuitous: like the crow's pecking of the thief's eye. There are flashbacks of Christ's teaching, but Gibson's film relegates these to backseat as he emphasizes the torture chamber of the killing. At the start of the film Gibson quotes Isaiah 53: By his wounds we are healed. At the end of this film, we are as transgressed as Christ but hardly healed.Take away the slow-mo close-ups of violence, what is left of The Passion is very simple: a tale of a distraught mother, an adrogynous-looking Satan, and a sympathetic Pilate -- a more conventional movie than the reviews would allow. As some will argue, the result is well-meaning -- certainly watchable (for all it's brutalities), but it's very hard to see it as spiritual or moral manna to anyone.",3,"Blood, blood and more blood...",1102896000,"12 13, 2004",-0.447

570,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,310263662,magellan,"[0, 0]","I just had a few miscellaneous comments on a film that has already sparked a good deal of controversy.This was destined to be a controversial film right from the start, with the concerns ranging from whether it was too violent to whether it was anti-Semitic. Well, to address the first concern, you can't have a successful movie these days without a lot of gratuitous sex, drugs, and violence, and since this is 2000 years ago and there weren't that many recreational drugs back then, they probably had to step up the violence quotient a bit to compensate, although I suspect people had sex back then, too. It just wasn't the object of as much existential angst, and AIDS was 2000 years in the future, so there were certain advantages to living in ancient times, even if you couldn't run down to the corner store and get a cold sixpack at 2 am in the morning.But getting back to the movie, this is certainly a powerful and evocative depiction of the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, and the entire cast really is superb. Although I usually don't like going to movies with subtitles, I didn't mind it in this case since Aramaic was the language of Jesus and it was interesting to hear it spoken, as I've only seen it written up to this point and had never heard it. A little piece of trivia here--classical Aramaic was thought by linguists to be another dead Semitic language (like Akkadian, Assyrian, Ugaritic, Phoenician, Punic, Coptic, Ammonite, Moabite, and the classical Arabic of the Koran, and Hebrew was dead until they brought it back), until an obscure congregation in Egypt and several other communities were found to be using it some years ago, although it was a more modern dialect. So I liked that aspect of the movie although I doubt I'll be trying to learn any dead Semitic languages anytime soon.The movie was indeed pretty violent, but ancient times certainly have no monopoly on violence compared to modern times, and more people died during the massive world wars and many smaller wars, genocides, purges, revolutions, and various other social conflagrations of the 20th century (which was at least 100 million people) than were probably even alive 2000 years ago. I also didn't find the movie anti-Semitic, and if the Jews hadn't killed Jesus some other group probably would have.So despite the controversial elements, overall, I think this was a well-done movie whose good points outweigh its bad points, and whatever the final critical judgment on it is, I'm sure the movie will be hotly debated and discussed for many years to come.",5,A few comments,1077753600,"02 26, 2004",-0.2095
571,A1R283L4SH4UP8,310263662,Magpie,"[1, 3]","I thought this film was very good. Mel Gibson succeeded in what he was attempting to do, which was not to tell the life story of Jesus but to portray his last 12 hours on Earth. These last 12 hours are interspersed with stream-of-consciousness flashbacks (The Sermon On The Mount, The Last Supper, etc, etc) to allow many of the events to be placed in some form of context. Again, Gibson succeeds at what he's attempting. All of the performances are excellent. The only scene that took me out of the film was the scene with Herod; which although may be historically accurate just came off as Gibson not liking homosexuals too much (see also Braveheart). But this is a minor gripe. I also did not see the movie as anti-Semitic. I believe that if you are already prone to being anti-Semitic, the movie's not going to change your mind, what with the Pharisees and the angry mob demanding Jesus' death. But not all Jews are portrayed as evil. I'm thinking specifically of the common man who helps Jesus carry his cross to Golgotha. In short, this was a small group of people who were demanding his death, I think only a weak-minded individual could find cause to damn an entire race of people because of the actions of a few. Plus, there is the belief that Jesus was to die that day no matter what, it was his destiny to die for our sins. I came away from the film with a deeper belief of that than anything else.I also have to comment on the violence. While I never felt it was gratuitous, I did feel it was the the most realistically brutal and graphic I have ever seen in a film. I am 29 years old, have seen many many brutal violent and controversial films, they still never affected me to the point that this film did. By the crucifixion scene, my stomach was turning and my fingertips were starting to feel a little numb. I have never had a physical reaction to a film like that before. Again, Gibson succeeds. The issue I have is that this film is rated R. Not NC-17 or even Unrated. I don't know how this movie got released with an R, but I have my guesses (mainly influence, money, or just plain subject matter; meaning the MPAA was not going to give a Jesus movie an NC-17). In any case, releasing this movie with an R rating was wrong, and it shows how the MPAA does not have a single clue what they're doing. If a film is sexually explicit, it will receive an NC-17. The MPAA however does not seem to have an issue with graphic violence. I think this is just part of the reason why our American culture is morally bankrupt, since our culture dictates the rules set by the MPAA. The violence in this film would be traumatizing for a child or even young teenager, yet if a parent wants, they can accompany their child to this movie. If it was NC-17 or Unrated, anyone under 18 could not get in, period. This is not a movie for children, this is strictly a film for adults who have the ability to take the violence they're seeing and place it in a context of the rest of Jesus' story. Even then, I know of adults who have seen this film who have had trouble sleeping afterwards for days.Finally, the reason I don't give this film 5 stars is simply from a film standpoint, it feels unfinished. Again, I know that this was Gibson's goal, to re-create the last 12 hours of Jesus' life. But it feels like a 10-hour, 5 DVD long movie exists and I put in the 5th DVD in first to watch. The movie is so authentic looking, so powerful and so hypnotic, it makes me wish Gibson had, or would make a mini-series (only aired on pay cable obviously) of Jesus' entire life. I think THAT would be excellent.",4,Mel Gibson's passion,1078444800,"03 5, 2004",-0.1303
572,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,310263662,Maine Writer David,"[17, 21]","After watching The Passion of the Christ, I was compelled to go back and read the Gospels, something that I had not done since Catholic School. It was that stirring and important a film for me. But getting to the theater to see it, ironically, was a bit of a passion, in and of itself, for me. Feeding off media accounts that described the film as brutal, violent, and horrific--Roger Ebert called it the most violent film he had ever seen--my interest in the story clashed against a visceral desire to avoid sitting through two hours of gore. Why, I thought, should I put myself through that? And then I started dreaming about the film, about the issue of whether I should see it or not, and it became more and more apparent that I had to do so. After three weeks, I overcame my fear and anxiety and, with the help of friends, spent Friday night watching it in the nicest theater I could find.Mind you, I'm not a churchgoer; my relationship with God is very personal and private. But, even during my agnostic youth, I've always been moved by Jesus and many of his teachings. And I'm certainly not a Roman Catholic anymore, for reasons that my other reviews ought to make clear. But the story of Jesus is not about denominations.When I got to the theater, there was an odd juxtaposition of all the screaming, laughing kids going to see Hollywood mainstream entertainment my own nervous anticipation. It struck me how divorced many young people are from the story of the Passion, and, indeed, all religion. And as I sat waiting for the film to begin, I steeled my nerves and awaited the carnage.Now maybe I've watched too many news programs and Arnold Schwartzenegger films, but the Passion simply wasn't as brutal as the reviews had suggested. Sure, it is hard to watch at times, but we have become so numbed to brutality--at least I have--that I was not overwhelmed by it. My reaction was that I was watching something that awful people do with disturbing frequency around the world. It brought to mind the poor souls who were tortured in Iraqi jails or by intelligence agents of ostensibly modern countries, the young children raped and brutalized by pedophiles, the women raped and mutilated everywhere. The brutality in Passion, however, was presented with such power and lyricism, that I found myself in tears through much of the movie. I found myself filled with compassion and shame for what the human race had done to such a kind and wonderful man. And isn't that what the story of the Passion is all about?This movie probably is not for people thirteen or younger. I did not bring my own thirteen-year-old, but not because of the violence. I told him that he had to read the Gospels first, become familiar with the story, talk to me about it. (I can count on one hand the number of times he's been to church, and we have never read The New Testament together. But the Passion has inspired me to read the Gospels with him.)Sadly, I feel compelled to answer the charges of anti-semitism that have swirled around this movie for years. It isn't anti-semitic. Not in the least. These charges are false arguments that really go to displeasure over the nature of the Gospels, not Mel Gibson's movie. Indeed, the Gospels paint in a bad light--a very, very bad light--the religious aristocracy of the time. They are painted as materialistic, power-hungry, and sordid, no different than most church aristocracies. That they behaved in a blood-thirsty, sanctimonious manner (demanding death for blasphemy) was not only typical for the times, but is consistent with how many churches have behaved. How many Roman Catholics died based upon charges of blasphemy, after all? That these awful people were Jewish, well, that's just happens to be the Gospel story. And to the claim, false of course, that the Jews in the film were depicted badly, that's simply selective nonsense. All of the good characters in this movie happen to be Jewish as well, even those who do not join Christ or abandon Judaism. Indeed, on his way to the cross, many Jewish people are weeping over the inhumanity of Jesus' torture and death. But why the charges of anti-semitism then? Fear, mostly. Fear that ignorant people will, again, use the story of the Passion as an excuse to inflict evil on Jews. That is a reasonable fear, given history. But it cannot justify the suppression or criticism of a core event in Christianity, in my opinion. And the rabid outcry of the film's detractors has only increased the chances of madmen using the story of the Passion in evil ways.I loved this film, as you can probably tell.

I wasn't prepared for the emotion punch in the gut that it deliveredThere were times when it took every fibre of my being not to cry my eyes out like some little child. As I sat transfixed in my seat, as the movie unfolded, the enormity of what this Man and his sacrifice entailed was almost too much to bear.I would respectfully disagree with those critics and viewers who felt the magnitude of the bloodshed and violence in this movie was excessive.I can recall the biblical films from my youth - The Greatest Story Ever Told, King of Kings - which depicted the last week of His life and particularily the crucifixion in a relatively antiseptic fashion. And while I thoroughly enjoyed these films, they never really had a signicant emotional impact on me - not even as a child.!And I think this was exactly what Mel was trying to get at with The Passion of The Christ. I really think he's saying Look people - this is what this Man endured for you and I. I think Mel really wanted to try and show us in as much graphic detail as possible how much this Man suffered for us and our sins.!I think the exact SAME technique was employed so successfully by Speilberg during the filming of Saving Private Ryan. There have been many, many movies which told the story of the allies landing at Normandy. But I cannot recall a single cinematic instance where the violence that must have taken place there was depicted so graphically as it was in this film.I also loved the fact that The Passion of The Christ was done entirely in Arameic, which is such a beautiful sounding language. Whiel I am normally not the biggest fan of subtitles, I confess that I rarely even noticed them in this film. It merely provided this epic picture with a measure of authenticity that every previous biblical epic lacked.There has been some mild criticism about the artistic license which Mel took in depicting Satan throughout this film. Well, frankly I thought it was done very, very well. In fact, I think one of the more powerful scenes in the movie occured at the end - after Christ uttered it is finished on the cross and died - and we see the scene of Satan screaming as he realizes that Death and Sin have been conquered by this Man.

Don't let the violence blind you to the point of this film, that this man had a vision and was willing to withstand any pain in order to share it with the world.Mel Gibson has said that he drew from the eyewitness accounts collected in the Bible's New Testament, as well as the diaries of the Catholic mystic, Anne Catherine Emmerich as collected in her book, 'The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ'. Even if you are not a Catholic or a Cristian, everything in this movie has been supported as historically accurate by many secular academics. It also draws from films such as Jesus of Nazareth and others.The film was made with an eye towards accuracy and its realism is often difficult to watch because of the tortures Jesus endures. All of the visual imagery serves a purpose, and shows us realistically just how much pain Jesus was willing to go through to fulfil what he saw as his destiny.The dialogue is in Latin, Aramaic and Hebrew with english subtitles. Contrary to what other reviewers have suggested, these are not dead languages just yet, though aramaic and latin are only spoken in small enclaves of the world. There are still populations that grow up speaking off-shoots of these languages. I applaud the film-maker for boldly attempting to film this in the original languages of the time period portrayed. The actors do wonderful jobs in these languages, a difficult task indeed.The film is also a masterpiece of cinematography. This wide screen edition of the DVD finally allows the home viewer to see the film done justice. I've seen the movie several times and the wide screen DVD better captures the power of watching the film in a theatre than the VHS or regular format DVD.The scenery and sets are also impressive. No expense was spared in bringing the film-makers vision to life.Yet all of these incredible elements are trumped by superb directing and acting. Caveziel gives us what is in my humble opinion the best portrayal of Jesus to date. I am not a Jesus scholar, but I have seen a lot of movies like this. These performances are impressive.This film will not be appropriate for small children or those with thin skin. Whatever your personal feelings or beliefs are, this movie is a landmark of history being told through film. Watch it and let us all learn from it so that this history will never be repeated!",5,"History Brought to Life, an Incredible Story, a Great Film!!",1093824000,"08 30, 2004",0.2354
581,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,310263662,Mark Turner,"[2, 4]","THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is perhaps the most talked about movie in the history of film. Other films have been condemned, discussed, dissected and more. But this film has received more anger ridden controversy than the last movie about Christ to do so, THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST. And is the controversy worth noting? Perhaps. But some of it is nothing more than the rants of people who never saw the film. The film does deserve to be seen and discussed.For anyone living in a cave over the past few years, the movie focuses on the last day in the life of Jesus Christ (Jim Caviezel). It opens with his praying on his last night in the garden and moves quickly forward to his betrayal by Judas and subsequent torture and persecution by anyone with power at the time.A sect of Jews led by Caiphas found Jesus to be a threat to their power base. In response, they set out to have him destroyed. More than destroying his following, they actually wanted him wiped off of the face of the Earth. And they set out to do so. This has caused some to consider the film anti-Semitic. The fact of the matter was there were two choices of the people involved to crucify Christ at that time: the Jewish leaders or the Roman leaders. History has shown that it was the Jewish leaders that called for his demise. Plus the fact is that Jesus himself was a Jew. It is not anti-Semitic to state this. It is merely history. And for those who believe, there was no other option for those leaders if God's plan was to be followed through.The movie proceeds to show the physical persecution of Jesus from there forward. When he is arrested and transported to the temple, he is beaten with the chains that bind him. When he is in the temple and accused, he is beaten by the mob. All of this is disturbing in its own right. But things get progressively worse.Taken to Pilate so that he might put Jesus to death, Pilate opts for the political ploy of sending him to Herod, the king of Jesus land of birth, to judge him. Herod sends him back. Pilate caves but not completely, ordering Jesus to be punished but not put to death. And this is where the truly brutal point of the film begins.Jesus is taken to the guards for scourging. For those who do not know, this is when Jesus was beaten. Many times we have heard about Jesus being whipped, lashed or beaten. But never has it been this graphically portrayed. The guards taunt Jesus and are presented as sadistic oafs. They begin with reed like canes and when that doesn't offer enough damage, when Jesus continues to rise, they switch to a cat-o-nine tails type whip, tipped with pieces of glass. These cut into Jesus' flesh, ripping him apart like so much meat. When finished, the stones surrounding Jesus are covered in blood.Throughout the grueling punishment that Jesus receives, his mother Mary is witness. She sees the torturous treatment that her son receives. She sees the pain and anguish he is going through. And she conveys on her face the pain that she is suffering along with him.Near death, Jesus is once again taken to Pilate. Still unwilling to condemn this man to death, he turns the matter over to the people who call out for his demise. Broken and bloodied, Jesus is forced to carry his own cross to be crucified on. Shredded beyond belief, he does so, faltering several times along the way, at one point requiring assistance.The final act of the film offers perhaps the most realistic glimpse of what those who were crucified had to endure. It is painful to watch. Director Mel Gibson never lets go of the viewer's throat, forcing you to witness the pain that Jesus, Gibson's representation of God on Earth, went through. And it leaves you wasted by the film's end.There is no way that a person of faith, a person who believes in God and Jesus can walk away from this film untouched. The images are seared into your mind. Although I do not attend church, I believe in God and Jesus. And as I watched, beginning with the scourging, I found myself crying. Sure I had heard that people were doing this. I was prepared to control myself while watching. But as the film progressed, I cried several times, unable to stop and never feeling ashamed of it. This movie can affect you as strongly as this.From a technical standpoint, the movie is very well made. The photography is well done, the story told plainly and simply and the direction done so as to not make you notice. It was Gibson's passion with his belief in Christ that made this film a reality. He has taken much heat from the Hollywood community for bringing his vision to life. It has been said that he may never work in Hollywood again. If that were possible, it would be their loss, not his.The movie opened big, making more money than anyone could ever have expected by a movie of this sort of topic. It caused more discussion of religion and belief than any movie that I can ever recall. And perhaps, even though he has suffered the slings and arrows of an impartial press and industry, perhaps it was worth it. Because at the end of the day, Gibson was able to make people think once again about God. And that is an accomplishment in itself.I highly recommend that everyone see this film. It will touch you no matter what you believe. If it doesn't, then you have no feelings inside.",5,"YES, IT IS A DEVESTATING EXPERIENCE",1205539200,"03 15, 2008",-0.1709

I mean I get worked over so bad on the basis daily that it really kind of cheers me up to see somebody getting worked over much worse.Of course it kind of interferes with one's ability to take the movie seriously that the characters behave with such vaudevillian exaggeration that they seem to be playing to a gallery of nine-year-olds. Subtle the Israelites were not, apparently. And then there's the fact that the entire action of the movie is Jesus getting messed up. Its like a movie that consists of one, very protracted, very one-sided, fight scene. An action movie of the most lugubrious sort.But the real question every Christian needs to ask themselves is, would they have followed Jesus if they had been around him at that time and place? I'm guessing the answer is no. As for Smell Gibson, I think he needs to stop taking himself so seriously and let somebody else have a crack at it. This is really just a B movie that you seem to walk into the middle of. Why no teachings of Jesus? Why no childhood of Jesus? Because, my friend, that simply is not good box office. Whaddre we making here, some kind of chick flick? No, lets get right to the gory part and stay there. Can't miss. See, its not really important what Jesus actually taught, its just important that he got worked over real bad. Why? Because no teenager is gonna go see a Bible movie unless its full of violence. Smell Gibson, if he were present at the time of Christ, would have been selling tickets to the crucifixion. It is impossible to deny, because that is precisely what he is doing here. What was that Jesus said, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven? Oh, I forgot, lets not obsess on what Jesus may or may not have said. Lets just get some popcorn and a couple of big gulps that we smuggled in from 7-11 and enjoy the splatterfest.addition 9-05-04: The problem with Christianity, said G.K. Chesterton, was not that it has been tried and found wanting, but that it has been found difficult and left untried. Let me repeat that. It has been found difficult and left untried. Found DIFFICULT AND LEFT UNTRIED. Am I getting through to you now? Nobody is actually following Christ's teachings because this is a highly inconvenient thing to do. Jesus said, you cannot follow both me and money. And yet here we see multimillionaire Smell Gibson coming on all pious. Jesus said, Resist not evil. And he walked his talk by getting crucified. Again, highly inconvenient teachings. Gee, what to do... uhhh, how about we just pick and choose what we like the sound of and then sort of bandy that stuff around while we collect brownie points for going to church and sitting there like a bump on a log? Looks like we're all set.Addition 9-10-04: Consider also, the title of the film. The Passion of The Christ. This phraseology is inescapably vulgar. First, I believe one is supposed to get the wrong idea: Yeah, Christ sure was passionate. Or, better yet, Gee, I didn't know that Jesus got lucky. Is this a French film? Joe Six Pack is supposed to go wandering inno the theater expecting a stag reel. But lets say the audience gets wised up and then no longer expects a stag film - like right about the time they're driving the nails through his palms. Then the title becomes a commodification of Christ's crucifixion. THE Passion of THE Christ. Any way we could get the word the inno that title a few more times?

Either way, this is not entertainment in any sense, it is a brutal, bloody, honest, and passionate film, depicting the last 12 hours of the life of Christ, not his entire life as some people initially believed. It's not an easy viewing experience, difficult to take and at times excruciating. It is a front row seat to the torture, humiliation, and crucifixian of Christ in all it's bloody glory. I found myself turning away quite often, unable to take it. However, I appreciated it.Most people are angry that the film is one torture scene after another, but I saw bravo to Mel Gibson for getting this film made. The people who don't like it are the ones who don't understand it, or maybe, are turned off by all the violence. One of the amazon reviewers felt the film stank because it was in French or something and the soldiers are wusses.

585,AAY1YLTKK4JC7,310263662,Martin Andrade Media Gurgitator,"[1, 1]","Well, this movie is like any other ever made. Because of its religious nature, it is nearly impossible to judge it simply as some flick to go see. However, I'll first judge the film on whether or not you should go out and see it in the theatres, then on its movie merits, and I'll conclude with some thoughts on what this movie means theologically.If you are looking for a film to escape into, or looking for great entertainment value, or basically most of the reasons we go to see movies, The Passion is not the movie for you. Firstly, this film is horrifyingly graphic and violent. It is an accurate reflection of life as it was. Outside of the graphic nature of the film, the 100 minutes of cellulite that represents that sum total of Christ's sacrifice is agonizing. Though Mel Gibson breaks some of this up with flashbacks from Christ's earlier years, it's just so intense that if you don't understand the theology of the film, you won't enjoy this at all. Simply said, this film was made for Christians that are committed to their faith, not for agnostics, atheists, or the average filmgoer.I don't mean to imply that this film is somehow too good for atheists, agnostics and non-believers. I simply mean to state that this film is not attempting to be entertaining, or thought provoking, or anything else. Christ's teachings are skimmed over, and not really mentioned, the consequences of the crucifixion are not expelled upon. Simply, this is a portrayal of The Passion of Jesus as He went through what was destined.The merits of the film as a film are not lacking by any stretch of the imagination. Though the film is based on the Gospels, as a story the life of Christ is far from boring. Betrayal, skepticism, murder, conspiracy, love, belief, purpose. All are part of the story of His last day.Similarly, there aren't any plot problems, subplot problems, theme issues, or major holes to speak of. The accounts of His crucifixion take less than three pages of text per gospel. As such, simplicity prevents questions of direction and purpose.Mel Gibson directed this film quite well. The film flows together quite well. Mel's vision of the last day of Christ is well done. I am at a lack for words when it comes to describing the thanks I have for Mel Gibson for doing this film in the way he has. His choice to be the man who nails Christ to the cross is important, and all but avoids silly questions about the anti-Semitic nature of this film. Gibson's vision of the humiliation and struggle on His last day are awakening. As a convert from atheism to Christianity, this movie has helped me in ways innumerous.Mel Gibson aside, the acting in The Passion is extraordinary in itself. The highlights are Hristo Shopov's portrayal of Pontius Pilate. Also, kudos are needed for Rosalinda Celentano's thankless portrayal of Satan. Ms. Celetano's performance was visually spectacular . Finally, James Caviezel gives an unbelievable performance of endurance as Jesus. These actors deserve a lot of credit for making this film what it is.What is this movie? An attempt to show the earthly pain that God as Man went through for us, all of humanity. He carried our sins, the sins of all Mankind in an ongoing sacrifice. That burden is incomprehensible to us as humans, but we get a taste of it here in this film. Thank you Mel Gibson.",5,.....&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;speechless>>>>......,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",0.0573

It is directed by Mel Gibson who invested $30 million of his own money to do it. I respect his passion in making the passion, he needed to do somethings differently though.The Passion of Christ is really about the beating of Christ. Never before in any movie have we seen one man take such a punishment. When Christ gets scourged by the roman soldiers it was the most intense scene i've ever seen since Omaha Beach in Saving Private Ryan. They scourged him to bad. The cuts they put on him would have made a man bleed to death. The march to Calvary with his cross was also a painful sight to watch. You continue to see him get beat brutally and the crowd throws stones at him. It was to long and those two scenes take up over an hour worth of filming. The crucifiction is also very intense. When they rip is shoulder out of place to stretch him on the cross so they can keep nailing him to it I cringed bad. I don't ever remember cringing like that. You see the nails go in him and you see the blood squirt out with each hit. It's rather intense and in my opinion way to much.The scariest aspect the movie didn't relate to is that the beating and Jesus dying on the cross was nothing to what he suffered in the garden. He sweat blood from all of his pores. In angel of the lord came to give him comfort and yet it still didn't. They show a little bit in the beginning, but you never get the idea in the movie that this man just atoned for the sins of the whole world. It's the sacrifice that Jesus made in the garden that has made it possible for us to live with him again.I didn't like how they put Satan in the movie. Never does it say anywhere in the gospels that Satan was there. It doesn't say he wasn't there, but he wasn't needed in the movie. He doesn't add anything to it except for a big creep factor to it. You don't want to be creeped out while witnessing a beating like the one Jesus gets. I could have done without so much Mary, but it was made by Cathloics and they have their own beliefs. I respect that and Mel Gibson did a good job of not trying to throw his ideas of religon at you. There was some Hollywood in the movie, but it is accurate.The movie was made well. The costumes look fantastic. The sets look great as well. They speak Hebrew and Latin and you get English subtitles. It adds to the movie well and it wouldn't be nearly as good without it.All the actors are great. A perfect cast was made for the movie. Jim Cavaziel is great as Jesus. He's very sincere with the part and he took it very serious. Everybody on the set did. I have a lot of respect for Jim. He did get scourged a couple of times and he did seperate his shoulder carrying the cross. He got hypothermia a couple of times as well. He lived the part. He wanted it to be great and his performance is.The movie really is pretty good. It does make you think about the sacrifice that Jesus made for us. They just made it to intense. Jesus did so much for us in his life. He had so many sermons and did so much. He loved us that he atoned our sins and gave his life for us. We should remember him more for his loving acts,not a big gigantic beating.The movie is intense and brutal. There were barely any dry eyes in our theater here. It definetly makes you think about what was done for us. It's not a jew bashing movie and it doesn't throw religon down your througt. It's not a movie for a younger audience, but it's definetly something that should be seen.If your going to learn about the last few hours of Christs life go to church and read your bible.

593,A6DMQ1ZU7YS9O,310263662,Matthew Higdon California Chariot,"[0, 2]","Strong cast; authentic feel, both linguistically and culturally; backed by a reflective and very moody soundtrack -- THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is probably the most powerful - and gruesome - cinematic depiction of the obedient sacrifice of Jesus for the sins of Israel and the world. Gibson has done a fine, if imperfect, job of reimagining the final hours of Christ's life.The picture opens in the Garden of Gethsemane with Yeshua/Jesus (Jim Caviezel) praying, agonizing before the Father about what must happen next. A detachment of soldiers - led by Judas son of Simon Iscariot - arrives to arrest Jesus. The party then brings him before Annas and Caiaphas, some of the Sanhedrin, and finally Pilate who, following a very bloody scourging, gives in and hands him over to be crucified. (I especially appreciate the attempt to represent Pilate's own situation.) Jesus, mocked by many and abandoned by even his closest followers, forgives his executioners - a unique response to one's torturers when compared to the responses found in certain intertestamental martyrological texts, such as 2 Maccabees 7 and 4 Maccabees 9-12. The film makes interesting spiritual connections, periodically showing Satan to be tempting Jesus to call it off (even though I think the Gospels suggest demonic forces may have been trying to get Jesus killed - e.g. Luke 22:53; John 13:27-30). Following death, Jesus is lowered from the cross and prepared for burial, which process is not shown. Less than one minute of screen time is devoted to the Resurrection - the movie's final scene - in which the stone rolls away, the linen cloths sink to a formless pile, and a very-much-alive Jesus stands and strides out of the tomb.Mr. Gibson has made a bold statement of personal faith - faith not in some societal cause or abstract ideology, but in an individual of the historic past. A statement made despite often enormous unpopularity. Agree with his religious views or not, Mel Gibson is a man of great personal conviction and courage.I do think, the more attention one pays to THE PASSION's characters and their actions, the more clear it becomes that Gibson does not paint the Jewish people with a single brush. There is at least some variety in behavior on the part of the Jews and even the Romans. (It is also worth noting that most people who grow up in the church understand that someone professing similar faith who wants to 'tell the story' on film does so NOT because he/she is anti-Semitic, but because he/she wants to be true to those biblical accounts.) On that note, I would have tried to cast more Middle-Eastern-looking persons for the role of Jesus and perhaps other Jews, to give it an even greater measure of authenticity.I would also have liked to see something in the way of special features on the DVD: the Making of the Passion, theatrical trailers, and the like (in fairness, however, Gibson may not have had the budget for all of that).For what it is, the movie serves as an intelligent and unapologetic portrayal with solid performances all around, especially by Caviezel. And ultimately, for the Christian, the tale of Yeshua's suffering and subsequent glorification - and all they involve - remains the most worthy-to-be-told story of this era ... and this film one of the most culturally and cross-culturally potent tools for evangelism I have ever seen or heard about.",4,Mel's Passion,1100476800,"11 15, 2004",0.1194

The violence didn't bother me so much I just wanted it to end. I decided to give it another shot and this time I liked it a little bit better. So when it came out on DVD I decided to pick it up.It is widely reported that Mel Gibson's original intent was show this movie without subtitles letting the image speak for itself. So I decided to watch it without subtitles. It is painfully obvious that this is how the film should be seen. The Passion of the Christ is not about the life of Jesus or the teachings of Jesus. It is about his death. In this case Passion meaning suffering. So when you take away the distraction of reading words on screen you focus on what you are seeing and the image becomes that much more powerful.As said before this movie is only about The Passion. It is not about Jesus' life or teachings. Those looking for that story will find it in other films. The best probably being Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ It does help to have a little background on the story.With the aid (or distraction) of subtitles The Passion of the Christ is long, boring and preachy. Without them it is a visual experience like no other and the best movie about Jesus Christ ever.The DVD comes in a bare bones release with no extra features.

What was the point? Mel Gibson seemed to be saying boy, these people were violent and wrong.But this sort of unipolar viewpoint, which did not serve Apocalypto at all, fits this film to a tee. Gibson is clearly a committed Christian of the Catholic stripe, and he has created pretty much the ultimate cinematic portrayal of the story of Christ's crucifixion. I can't imagine a film which would better indicate the depth of the physical suffering that Jesus of Nazareth must have endured, and the emotional pain this would inflict upon his relatives and best friends.The sets are all very detailed and ring quite true to the period. The actors in lead good guy roles are perhaps a bit too European looking, but given the film's production in Italy, some of this is forgivable. Either way, people have cast these characters with their own ethnicity for eons, so I'm willing to give that a pass.I kind of wish some of the more mystical elements had been left out. Jesus heals a roman soldier during his capture. Judas is attacked (in his mind at least) by little hobgoblin demon children. Christ is also tempted by Satan - who is played and visualized quite well by a spooky-looking actress, but nonetheless this feels like a bit of a tacked on element, despite mentions in the Gospels at various points. These elements are at worst a minor annoyance, but they strain credulity, which probably runs counter to Gibson's purposes.I guess I would have preferred that the human elements of the story stand on their own, because, frankly, that's all we have access to at this late date. We simply can't trust miracle stories and talk of mystical happenings. We don't have access to them. But by meditating on the human aspects of the story, we have something we can relate to and which may inspire faith in the other, less tangible things. To display them openly is to assume their existence before we are faithful.But this is just my opinion, I suppose, based on my reading, studies in philosophy, and my general skeptical bent. I've never seen a miracle, and no one I've trusted has ever reported one to me. Things handed down from 2000 years ago, re-translated dozens of times, do not strike me as reliable sources for amazing stories, none of which seem to happen in modern history and with the benefit of all the technology we have available to us to record such events. I mean, given all the cell phone cameras out there, where are all the indubitable miracles?Anyhow, I digress (my apologies to David Hume...). Even with its mystical trappings, this film in its immediacy and its viscerality certainly succeeds in forcing the viewer to ponder the human aspects. The mystical stuff is a sideshow, so to speak.For those with faith, this film should offer a potent meditation on a story which has been ingrained into the psyche, practically since birth. For a non-believer, this film offers a valuable insight into the passion that believers have for this story and for the man himself. Like a Socrates, Jesus of Nazareth seems to have been a singular man, the like of which is rarely seen. Contemplating this can deepen a non-believer's appreciation, if not deliver them into a completely faithful orientation to the material.To put it briefly, it's a brilliant film. Each shot is lovingly composed, and the visual impact and beauty of the images can't be faulted. The performances all feel very real and there is no actor who takes the viewer away from the time period. Gibson, similar to some of the other great directors such as Kubrick, Scorsese, Stone and he like, excels at creating scene. You really feel like 'you are there.'*******The Blu-Ray:The picture is quite beautiful. Black levels are solid, detail is quite good (though perhaps not the absolute best, I would say Dark Knight and Alexander top it), and color is very naturalistic. There is a bit of posterization in some shots of the sky (i.e. a sort of digital distortion or dot-crawl), but it only intrudes on 10 or 20 seconds of the film, and is probably in the source material. The DTS audio mix offers some nice directional effects, with crowd taunts and bird chirps in the rear sound field.Technically, it's about as good as I can imagine it looking. I did not see the film in the theater, so I cannot compare the level of fidelity.Extras include commentaries, and a recut version, which apparently is actually a bit shorter than the theatrical release. This version also cuts a bit of violence. A word to parents - cutting five minutes of gruesome violence leaves about, oh, 120 minutes of gruesome violence remaining in the movie. So plan accordingly insofar as your children can tolerate these kinds of things. Other extras: There are several commentaries on the main disc. The extra disc has many short documentaries on both production issues and historical context, though none are in HD, unfortunately.*********So should you buy it? Well, that's a tough question. If you're a devoted Christian who enjoys pondering these mysteries, and you also have a good HD setup, then sure, I can't see any reason not to. If you are not a Christian but are curious about what the hub-bub is about, then this is definitely worth at least a rental. Fans of historical fiction/docudrama will certainly find much to appreciate.Whether or not you buy it, this is definitely a film everyone should see at least once. It is a great film, like it or lump it. It is a vivid and very impactful telling of one of the very few central stories of our global culture. Keep in mind I do not want to put a Christian gloss on humanity here - if there were comparable films on Mohammad (a bit of an issue given the icon prohibition), Buddha, etc., I would recommend seeing those as well.On the whole, by any standards, this is a five-star release. It may not be for everyone's permanent collection.

Burns,"[1, 1]","If you've been living under a rock for the past, oh, year or so, I might as well inform you that the most controversial movie in years has been released into theaters. And this isn't Bernardo Bertolucci controversy; this isn't even D.W. Griffith controversy; this is first-rate, full-blown religious controversy, and it's done nothing but cling to every mention of director Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Turn on the television and they're talking about it, get in any gathering of people and it comes up, open any entertainment magazine and it's front-page news. But now it's February 25, Ash Wednesday nearly two-thousand years after the event depicted in the film occurred, and the movie has hit screens. I had the opportunity to see the film earlier this evening and see how all the criticism and controversy I've heard and read stands up. Well, as you'll read, that unjust criticism of anti-semitism, too-graphic violence, and spiritual insignificance tumbles like a man beneath a cross, and Gibson's ferocious, passionate film triumphs like the Savior from a tomb. In this review, I'll try not to give away why Gibson's film is set apart from other run-of-the-mill Biblical films; you can see it for yourself. But I do want to convey why The Passion ranks as one of the most important cinematic experiences I have ever had.Like any great epic, the first thing that stands out is how visually striking the movie is, and The Passion of the Christ is no exception. The camera trails gently through the garden, and we see Jesus. Except, this is not the mechanical, puppeteer Jesus of so many other passion plays this is a man who knows what lies before him. A man who knows the kind of responsibility he has. A man who, despite being scared out of his mind, knows that he can take the challenge. Jesus, played with grace and utter devotion by Jim Caviezel, is the human that many other narratives seem to leave out. I found myself amazed at Gibson's choice to show not doubt, but simply fear - something that would come to any man who had to endure what Jesus does in the next two hours of the film.The scenes in which Jesus is brought before the high priest Caiaphus have brought accusations of anti-semitism to the film, but anti-semitism was the last thing that came to my mind as various people stood before Him and ranted that He was nothing more than a crazy blasphemer that encouraged the drinking of His blood and the disobedience of Jewish customs. Well, to the leaders of the Jewish faith, that's what Jesus was - He was a man who went against their establishment and they found nothing more suitable than to have his life taken for it. In placid flashbacks that gorgeously contrast with the escalating violence of the proceedings, we see Jesus encouraging his disciples to love one another and even hate those that persecute them. That went against the teachings of the Pharisees, but it certainly has made the world a better place today. Gibson's film separates Jew-hating from people-loving, the notion that the film truly embraces.Not much time is wasted before the film launches into some of the most stomach-churning, brutal violence ever committed to mainstream cinema. In a brutal scourging sequence, we see pieces of Jesus' skin flayed off as multiple Roman soldiers pound him to within an inch of his life. The long, arduous trek to Golgotha features lashes with whips among other forms of physical torture. Before seeing the film, I was worried that accusations that the violence detracts from the film's spiritual meaning would ring true. It doesn't - the suffering of Christ depicted in the film produces not a feeling of pointless blood-spattering, but divine sacrifice. Jesus is shown as a man who was sent to spread a message of love and redemption, and Gibson's movie rightfully asserts that in order for it to all come to fruition, He had to endure this. But that is not to say that this movie is meant for any person, young or old. The violence is tolerable, but at times - barely.Any doubts about Gibson's intentions on making this film are dispelled in the climactic scene of the film in which Jesus has his hands and feet nailed to the cross on which he eventually dies. This disturbing-but-earthshakingly-powerful scene ranks among the most powerful I have ever witnessed in the cinema. The brutal nailing to the cross and presentation before the crowd represents the pinnacle of Christianity, the moment at which the weight of the world falls on one man's shoulders. And you feel it. At the movie's normal moments, it is accurate and engrossing. At moments like this, it's so powerful it's hard to look.I, too, probably like every other critic on the face of the earth, walked into the movie expecting to find gaping flaws, excessive use of an artistic license, and too-graphic violence, but getting up from my seat at the end of the immensely moving film, I could only think of...well, how much crap all of those critics are full of. Forget about what you've read - the violence is not repugnant, it serves a purpose; the film is not anti-semitic, it is accurate; the movie is not a publicity stunt, but a deeply-felt expression of one man's passion about one man's sacrifice. From the opening moments of The Passion, Gibson's film is a visually gorgeous, deeply emotional, and accurate rendering of the single most important event in the history of man. The film's brutal, violently moving climax elevates it to a standard of excellence that Gibson has never before achieved, and not only do I approve immensely of it, but I think that it is a landmark in religious art and a movie not soon to be forgotten. I'm trying to not use the word 'masterpiece' so much anymore, but I'm pulling it out of retirement for this movie.

Our Saviour didn't come here for pleasure, or for chatting with Herod, drink some wine, have wonderful feasts and marry a beautiful girl (some fools say he married Mary Magdalane)and be eternally happy as Hollywood wants us to believe. No. He came here to redeem us. He came here to show us how a Christian should face suffering And above this, he came here to show us the real face of the Father, Our Father that is LOVE. Seeing this movie is seeing how much Jesus loves us.Meditating The Passion of the Christ is the DEVOTION of Devotions. A lot of conversions have occurred after people meditating these sufferings of Our Lord. ALL the Saints have meditated and had a profound devotion for them. Even more, they recommended this devotion in order to obtain real sanctity of life, because the REAL LOVE (only somebody that is willing to suffer like this and die for you , really loves you!) attracts LOVERS.Regarding the accusations of antisemitism, I just have one recommendation. GET REAL. JEWS have always hated Jesus and his Church. They killed him and they persecuted and killed Jesus' followers. Deep inside they feel Guilty of these crimes and they think that denying the facts, buying some people's conciense is going to make them feel better. But that's not the case. I recommend them to ask forgiveness. First, to God and then to the whole world for al their crimes, lies and corruption they have sown in the world. Then they are going to feel free at last...Nobody is going to do anything or throw a sotone at them. We all are sinners!

603,A17LSEN4UY4XZQ,310263662,M. Daneker,"[32, 65]","Not being religious I have no bias toward watching a Christ figure get caned, torn up and crucified, however watching Scorsese brilliant, if too long, The Last Temptation of Christ (the temptation being Lucifer offering Christ a mans life if he gives up his role as the savior, guess which choice Jesus makes?)I was able to become involved with the character and what drove him. In Gibson's telling of the last 12 hours (with a few flashbacks to fill in plot holes)I get nothing but a feeling that Christ should have just stayed down when he had the chance.Let me make some points here:First: The story starts with Judas selling out Christ, it should have started with Christ coming to the Temple and saying he would tear it down and rebuild it in three days. This is the thing that inflamed the Jews to want him dead so bad, he threatened their power. Leaving this out of the film only leaves the viewer trying to grasp why they hated him.Second: No emotional involvement. Gibson tries to let the torture speak for itself. There's nothing more than fleeting flashbacks with Jesus (pronounced hea'shu) and either Mary his mother or his love, nothing to emotionally attach them to him, or us. Watching his mother weep over him when he gets back up after a brutal beating is called to an end, inflaming the Romans to inflict more damage, feels hollow. We haven't established anything beyond this is mom. He could have pointed the camera at any weeping extra in the crowd and put a subtitle my son! under her with equal impact. You have to ask, what the hell did he get up for? To be hurt more! Why? So he'd be a martyr. You know, I want Kerry elected president, should I invite Republicans to beat me to death to prove how horrible I think they are? There is a scene in The Village where a character is stabbed, there's nearly no blood, zero gore, yet the emotional impact is heavy, you fear for his life, you feel for his girl and you hate his killer. There's a castration scene in I Spit On Your Grave that shows nothing because it all takes place under a bubble bath, yet you know it's happening and you squirm and you want to look away. Then there's the F*** me Jesus scene in the Exorcist when you desperately want the suffering of the little girl to stop. In this film I just wanted Jesus to Stop Getting Up!Third: Gibson's Christ is not a persecuted Jew trying to lead people to the love of God, his father, he's a self righteous [dumber] who says father my heart is ready before torture Father, why have you forsaken me when he's nailed to a cross and I'm ready when he's had enough. Now why does he tell God he's ready to be flayed, then complain when it happens. Christ offers himself up for torture, then looks on as if to say, see what I do for you? Well, how asked him?Forth: No conclusion. Not only does Gibson not bother to show us why they Jews hate him (oddly, only Pilot's motivations are clearly shown, in the end he's the one you feel bad for, he doesn't want to hurt anyone, but doesn't what his head off either.) but doesn't show that any good comes out of it.Fifth: The Devil. What's with the Nelly - Demon - Reaper??? Some androgynous freak torments Christ, yeah, see the root of homophobia is that Gibson portrays Tran gendered people as Lucifer.Sixth: Now Ascension? What the hell, he rises and fade to black? What's this? Where's the lords message? Nowhere in this film. This film is a knock-off of Barker's Hellraiser. 127 minutes of torture with no beginning and no conclusion. A three hour film would have let us see Christ live and love before the crucifixion, and let us see the impact of resurrection. However Gibson just wanted an exploitation of pain thinly veiled as religious rhetoric.Last: If you believe in Christ, share what he stood for, not how he died! Peace, Love, Good Will. Not self righteous martyrs! Not Pain! Not Violence! Not hate and ignorance! This is a film only for those who know the entire story by heart because this is just one long scene way out of context.Finally: See the Last Temptation of Christ and Dogma, two misunderstood films made by people who love there lord and savior and want people to walk out with the positive not negative.

Fortunately, after ploughing a hefty chunk of his own money to finance it, he's gained it back - and then some! The Passion has made a tremendous amount in the US, and looks to go along the same lines in the UK. And there are rumours of a novelisation and a sequel. :)Everyone has to know the story of Jesus, whether you're a religious churchgoer, and read the bible, or whether you shun all that kind of thing. I won't transport you back to your Sunday School days here, you can read other reviews for that. Jim Caviezel plays the lead character, and was chosen because of his initials, he is the same age as Jesus when he died (33), and he is a devout Christian. Mel Gibson could have gone for a high profile name to boost the film a bit (Jason Patric and Johnathon Schaech were both apparently approached), but instead, he chose a relatively unknown actor, and shows you don't need an A-list actor to make a film a success. There are a lot of shots of Jim's eye (throughout most of the movie, one eye is completely swollen), which were digitally changed to brown, but his eyes are absolutely gorgeous!If you've seen this movie, you already know it's extremely violent. If you haven't, then you've probably read reviews, or heard through word of mouth, that it's one of the most gorily realistic movies out there right now, or ever. This movie is deeply disturbing, and brutally and vividly depicts the inhumanity of man to fellow man. Watching this, I felt physically sick at one point (the cat o'nine tails whip thing), and even halfway through, I wasn't sure how much more I could have taken. But although it's extremely gory, you can't drag your eyes away from the screen, you just feel you have to keep watching. It must have been hell for Jim to be a part of this movie, and there were probably points throughout the movie that he wouldn't have been sure how much more he could have done. He has spoken about a few of the difficulties he experienced while filming. These included being accidentally whipped twice, which has left a 14 inch scar on his back; being struck by lightning while filming the Sermon on the Mount and during the crucifixion, experienced hypothermia during the dead of winter in Italy.The film's dialogue is all in Aramaic, with some Hebrew and Latin. It is subtitled, and although some people may not want to see a movie where they have to read, the subtitles are in no way intrusive, and it's really easy to read them and follow the film at the same time. Some of the dialogue isn't subtitled (mainly spoken by the soldiers I noticed), but it doesn't really matter and most of the time, it's obvious what they're saying, just by watching the action. Some of the dialogue is pretty similar to dialogue today - yes is aye, which if you're Scottish, you'll use quite a lot, and idiot is still the same word, just idiota!In certain scenes you see a very androgynous person in the crowds, or right at the start when Jesus is praying. Just in case anyone was curious, this is a female, and she's supposed to be Satan. It's never explained that she is the Devil, but apparently, she's supposed to be.There aren't many well-known actors in this; the only recognisable name is Monica Bellucci, who stays pretty much covered up for once! (Sorry to disappoint all the male fans of her in Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions.) She plays Mary Magdalene, although it's not exactly obvious who she's actually supposed to be at first, she just seems to hang around with another Mary - Jesus' mother. She doesn't have much dialogue to say, but she looks amazing, even without the makeup piled on with a trowel. Some actresses can get away with not wearing so much makeup and they're dead lucky. Maia Morgenstern, who played Mary, mother of Jesus, is only six years than James Cavaziel, and certainly doesn't look old enough to play his mother!)There are going to be some people who will not like this film, whether it's because of all the hype, whether they're extremely fainthearted and won't be able to handle the violence - which I'd just like to say, I'm one of those people! But this movie you have to see to actually believe. No review will do this movie justice, whether it's a good or bad review. If you don't see it, you're not lining Mel Gibson's pockets (that could be a good or a bad thing), but on the other hand you're not seeing a piece of history.I think all the fuss about anti-Semitism is overblown. Although it was the Jewish priests calling for the crucifixion, it was the Roman soldiers dishing out all the brutal punishment. Also, it was never clear quite why there was such bad feeling towards Jesus.I now eagerly await the DVD (and the novelisation, and the sequel), and if Mel-baby doesn't take a chance and put hours of extras onto the DVD, I'll be severely disappointed. If all I get is a trailer, I'll put my foot down, and boycott it! He's a smart guy, I'm sure there will be loads of extras.

608,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,310263662,Melissa Niksic,"[7, 9]","The Passion of the Christ tells the familiar story of Jesus (Jim Caviezel) being captured by the Roman guard as he prays with his disciples in the garden at Gethsemane. Christ is then turned over to Pontius Pilate before ultimately being handed over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.Mel Gibson's screenplay does a good job of sticking to the original story of the crucifixion as laid out by the Gospels. He also deserves commendation for refusing to shy away from the torture of Christ that most other filmmakers have stayed away from when tackling this subject. However, the elements of blood and gore steal the focus from the core message that the film attempts to deliver.The violence of the film is what most people come away talking about after seeing it, which is understandable since the film is almost entirely about violence. The majority of the film focuses on the gruesome torture of Jesus, but it would not be fair to classify The Passion as the most violent film ever made. War movies such as Saving Private Ryan and even Gibson's Oscar winning epic Braveheart are just two of the many films that strike me as being much more violent than this film.However, if you do not possess a Christian understanding of the true passion of the Christ that Gibson is trying to depict, then you will likely come away from the theatre focused on nothing but the carnage.The Passion is a story of unconditional love and sacrifice. It purposely focuses on Jesus' torture and death in order to reflect Gibson's personal beliefs that Christ was indeed the Messiah who gave up his own life in order to offer the rest of humankind eternal salvation. And unless you are aware of that message, this film will be nothing to you except a story about a man who is severely beaten and then executed.Many critics of the film have claimed that it promotes anti-Semitism, and this debate has been responsible for much of the attention that The Passion sparked even months before its opening. However, Gibson has not in any way set out to promote anti-Semitism, and his film does no such thing. The movie accurately depicts the villains of the story, who are made up of a group of Jewish politicians, some sadistic Roman soldiers, and a selfish governor who willingly condemns an innocent man to death in order to serve his own political interests.There are many excellent performances in this film, notably Caviezel, Maia Morgenstern as Mary and Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene. However, Hristo Shopov steals the show as Pontius Pilate, who is forced to choose between his own beliefs and the pressures of his people in order to determine the fate of an innocent man.Rosalinda Celentano's character is one of the major liberties that Gibson takes with the script. She does a convincing job of playing Satan, but she appears at very random parts of the film and seems to detract from the rest of the scene instead of adding anything to it. (The fact that Gibson decided that Satan should look like Peter Jackson's depiction of Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy is also a bit distracting.)Anyone who has a slight knowledge of Christian tradition will be moved by The Passion. Those who do are not familiar with the story of the Gospels will be unable to grasp Gibson's message, and this film will be wasted on them. Gibson has done an amazing job of transcending the story of Christ's ultimate sacrifice to the screen. The Passion is the most accurate depiction of that story that has ever been made, and it should be admired for that, although it will ultimately have different impacts for people of different backgrounds.NOTE: This film has an R rating, which I deem as appropriate. There are many people clamoring about how The Passion should have been given a rating of NC-17 and that children have no business seeing this film. Although I think that parents should take their child's individual needs into consideration before allowing them to see any movie, I witnessed many young children in attendance with their parents at the theatre, and they appeared to handle the movie without a problem. Children who have been raised in a Christian environment will be familiar with the story of Christ's execution already, and parents may feel that the film is an excellent way to reinforce the story of Jesus' sacrifice.",5,"Brilliant, but misunderstood by most.",1085875200,"05 30, 2004",0.0206

That is the only reason I rate this movie 2 stars instead of 1.Now, where to begin? Why did Gibson make this movie? Well, Christianity is the largest religion that is currently in existence. If you create a movie that has 40% of Christianity buzzing, the other 60% will take notice. Would you believe that Sunday school children were actually taken to see this drivel? I can, know why? Gibson created one of those movies that make a whole group of people feel they have to see it. You ever see how many star wars fans lined up to see episode 2? That's because they felt they had to see it, no matter how bad it is.Another thing that people blow out of proportion is how Gibson used his own money to make this movie. So what! He makes a couple million each movie he makes! And don't you think he kinda knew that it would be a box office smash? I mean a movie about Jesus created by Mel Gibson?! Cha-ching! If Gibson had donated the money to the Christian Children's Fund, then that'd be something.Did you know that the Bible says very little about Jesus' death? It doesn't go in-depth like this trash does. What you basically are presented here is a snuff movie that shocks the moviegoer into paying attention.The basic idea behind this movie is that Jesus died for our sins; a theme that Gibson pounds into us as much as possible. He tries to display, as graphically as possible, the passion of Christ. This leaves many Christians open to saying things like how can you still be a (non-Christian religion) when you just saw how much Christ suffered for you? The ultimate guilt trip.A person shouldn't be forced to believe in something just because of how horrendously the prophet died. They should follow it because of what they taught. The fact that people went in droves to watch this filth is a real disservice to Jesus. Jesus taught love, forgiveness, and compassion. Why do you need a 3-hour movie to remind you of his teachings? Why do you need to be shocked into following his examples?Let me also remind the reader that the passion has existed since the Middle Ages. Do we really want to go back to a time of fire and brimstone and all that jazz? Why drag an old, tired play into the 21st century?And finally, I would like to close by saying this: I am not a Christian. I'm sure I made that abundantly clear. I was raised catholic but have since converted. I am a spiritual man and I am very open-minded. I believe in love and kindness and forgiveness. What hypocrites some of these reviewers are when they create reviews with titles like A TRUE MASTERPIECE !! SHOWS HOW STUPID NON BELIEVERS ARE That review was created by a person called S.D.S Look at his other reviews, he calls Dale Earnhardt some pretty horrible things. If you were a true believer then you would not judge him, since you are not God. And even if you were God, YOU'D FORGIVE HIM!As long as you live a good life, as long as you love your neighbor, as long as you forgive he that hurts you, you are living for the Lord. And you don't have to watch this movie to prove how much of a believer you are. So instead of wasting time to watch this horrible movie, why don't you volunteer at a homeless shelter, or donate the money you would have spent on this movie to a charitable organization?",2,"Donate your money, don't waste it on this!",1133654400,"12 4, 2005",0.0313

Yes, this movie was very realistic in the portrayal of the time in which Jesus would have lived and it follows certain scriptures very closely but it didn't compel me to become more religious. Last Temptation.. made me want to read the Bible more and research religion further. Last Temptation... didn't follow the scripture all that closely but showed what Jesus as a man would have had to gone through...even though this in to itself is pretty blasphamous. The Passion is basically an extremely violent and bloody retelling of the last hours of Christ, which is how it should be shown... although is it something that really needs to be shown? For aetheists or agnosticts I don't believe this movie is going to make them believe anymore than they would have before. For Christian's it could either be uplifting or an extremely depressing couple of hours. I saw a showing with a friend's church group and at the end I saw an elderly lady with her head down just sobbing...there is nothing really happy or redeeming in this movie. The biggest fault of the movie is not going more deeply into the reserrected Jesus story, the movie would have been a tad less depressing if it went into that story more instead of having the audience sit through about 2 hours of ultraviolence.If anyone has seen any of Mel Gibson's films they would know that Mel Gibson is no stranger to violence. In this movie it is no different. It would have been nice to to see Mel try something other than violence to run the story along. It can be said that a person may feel more appreciation toward Christ after viewing this movie but personally I felt the violence bogged the movie down. It seems that Mel Gibson uses violence as a way of getting his movies noticed, with a movie of this subject I don't believe he needed it...not that I oppose of violence in films. I don't believe this is the best movie about Jesus, I would have to say Last Temptation of Christ is more psychological and therefore a better movie. Scorsese was more imaginative with his movie and didn't depend on violence in making his point. Both are very personal movies for the directors but The Passion is just not as spiritually redeeming as Last Temptation of Christ. I would recommend Last Temptation of Christ over The Passion of the Christ to anyone who wants to be spiritually inspired.",3,One Opinion...

And most of these films, except for Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ have been exceedingly reverent and unfortunately hokey: films that were made mostly to tap into a ready-made audience of the devout and purposely not meant to cause a stir and therefore ignoring what it was that made Jesus the revolutionary man that he was. A Man that was as conflicted about we humans as we are about ourselves.One of the best things about Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ is that it shows Christ not only as a Spiritual man but as a man whose time on earth was spent as, not only a leader, but as a dedicated son, an expert craftsman and a kind and loving friend to his disciples. He was the ultimate human being after all and Gibson captures this side of Christ amazingly well.The Passion of the Christ also raises as many questions as it attempts to answer and this is on the plus side. But several things about it are too tame: the music for one is dreadful: all soaring voices, and Middle Eastern doodling cheapens the effect of the visuals. The music should have been spare and lean, used mainly to quietly underscore the inherent drama of the story. Another minus is the use of Aramaic and Latin instead of English or some other modern language. Authentic or not, all this does is telescope the story away from us rather than bringing it as close to us as possible.The incessant brutalizing of Christ is graphic to say the least and even though I had to turn away from the screen on several occasions; I felt that the violence was ultimately cathartic and dramatically truthful. Remember this a film, after all: a drama based on the Bible and interpreted by Gibson and his screenwriter. The purpose of this film is to dramatize, i.e. tell its story in an effective, truthful and honest a manner as possible.The issues with Gibson using this story to primarily implicate the Jews as the primary assassins of Christ are ludicrous: they had a part because they felt Jesus was a threat but equally to blame was Pilate and most of the Romans and almost everyone else including Judas, Peter and Jesus himself. The only people that seemingly escape Gibson's blame are Mary and Mary Magdalene. In fact one of the most touching scenes in this film shows Mary placing her ear to a stone road to listen for her son's heartbeat as he hangs handcuffed to a pole below.The Passion of the Christ is not perfect, but it is honest and caring and comes from a place of Love. And because it so personal and emotional, so much of the Light, it will be praised and reviled for many years to come.",4,Forgive Us,1077667200,"02 25, 2004",0.0487

Not only does the Aramaic work well and convincing but also the story was fresh and exciting. Gibson does a super job of directing putting in some very scary scenes such as a snake that appears to come from a demon and having some children turn demonic and attack Judas.As Jesus is beaten by sadistic and unfeeling Romans, the populace look on including his mother. You feel her pain as the torturers flay him to a point that you wonder if he has any skin left. Throughout the beatings there are some very nice flashbacks, showing Jesus in happy times with his mother, making a table for her.The only drawback to the movie is the part when Jesus is made to drag his cross to the crucifixion site. Gibson seemed to drag that part out almost 30 minutes. It is quite interesting that a man is forced to help Jesus carry his cross and the man seems to have more difficulty than Jesus even though Jesus is a bloody mess all over his body.The movie seems to place the main blame on the Jewish priest Kyfus who seems to be obsessed with seeing Jesus die for going against Kyfus's teachings. Kyfus spurs the Jewish crowd to demand that Jesus be crucified.Like anything Biblical, we will never know what is the truth and what is someone's interpretation. And yes, with things like The Da Vinci Code, many people question if any of this story is true. That is up to your own personal beliefs. However, whether your believe or not, Gibson has made a powerful film and by far the best rendition of the story that I have seen and this movie can be enjoyed both by believer and non-believer alike!",5,You Don't Need to Be a Believer to Enjoy this Film!,1087603200,"06 19, 2004",-0.0475

Mel Gibson's personal vision erases any memories of Hollywood's attempts to cinematize the last days of Jesus on earth.Forget the anti-Semitic ravings; forget the claims of brutality and gore for gore sakes; forget Gibson's personal asides. This movie should be required for any Christian who believes in the Messiah and understands that his death was for us, for all generations, with no blame being placed, only the eternal message of love one another at its foundation.No movie has affected me as much as this movie. Being a Catholic, I have tended to think of movies like The Greatest Story Ever Told or 'King of Kings as representations of the Passion. This movie, however, overwhelms the others by presenting the scourging and the Crucifixion in the brutal means in which they occurred. How anyone can watch this movie and not feel the lashes of the whips, the pain of the nails and not be touched is beyond me. Gibson has helmed a movie that I will never forget. There are so many images that haunt me that it's hard to pinpoint any of them. I cried, but not only at the brutality of the Roman soldiers and the hordes of people who spit, mocked and humiliated this gentle man whose only crime was his heritage. I cried when a mother remembered her son's first fall, and how she rushes to him when he drops beneath the weight of the cross; the memories of Jesus' dining room table; the Last Supper. It is to not only Gibson's credit, but to the actors, technicians, Caleb Deschanel's cinematography, John Denby's awesome score, that THE PASSION is a movie of epic proportions.James Caviezel doesn't say a whole lot, but his trip to Golgotha is a brave performance, and Jim is magnificent. Equally impressive is Maia Morgenstern as Mary, the mother. With very little dialogue, Morgenstern embodies the heart of this extraordinary woman, and her performance is Oscar worthy, as is Caviezels. Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene is wonderful, as is Jacob Mehr who plays Simon of Cyrene.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is not an easy movie to watch; many times I wanted to turn my eyes away. But it is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen.

The movie, on its own, without judging it from a religious standpoint, is good. That's all. Good. There's nothing in it we haven't seen before (except for the graphic violence) in a film about Jesus. It's good, that's about it. Two things about it though - 1st- The ending - If it would've just stay faded out after the crucifiction, that would have been fine. But the ending they had WAS SO CHEESY. Jesus is in the tomb, stands up - we see a computer generated hole in his hand, the drums on the soundtrack come up, and he walks off. Why didn't they just have him turn, wink at the camera, and say I'm back! a la The Terminator? It was silly, unnecessary, and left a bad taste in my mouth when I left the theatre.2nd - The thing that disturbed me the most about this movie was not the bloody violence, the crucifiction of a savior, or any supposed anti-semetic stuff.

We follow him through trial, torture, and to his crucifixion under Roman imperial authority. Yes, this story has been told before on film, but Gibson's &quot;Passion&quot; is still worth seeing. It's a beautifully crafted film: sets, costumes, cinematography, musical score, etc. are all impressive, and superbly complement the script and performances.&quot;The Passion&quot; is noteworthy for its intense, graphic violence. Jesus is savagely tortured, and Gibson floods the screen with blood and ripped flesh. Is it too much? I'm torn on that question, but rarely have I seen human cruelty and human suffering so intensely capture on film.Caviezel is solid in the role, and brings a real warmth and humanity to the flashback scenes of Jesus' life before his trial and death. Interestingly, though, Roman governor Pontius Pilate (well played by Hristo Naumov Shopov) is better developed as a cinematic character; Pilate faces a real moral and political dilemma, and his decision drives the story forward. At times Jesus seems less a fully-fleshed character than a mirror through which we encounter Pilate, the disciple Peter, and others.I found a weak point in the film to be the depiction of the Jewish religious hierarchy. They are one-dimensional, and their relationship to Jesus is insufficiently fleshed out. If Gibson had explored these characters with the same attention given to the characters of Pilate and Pilate's wife, I think the film would have been even more powerful.Still, this is a rich, well-crafted film that can be analyzed on many levels. Colonial politics, the relations between religious and civil authority, capital punishment, mob thinking, the place of women in a male-dominated social sphere--these are some of the issues one could raise in a discussion of the film. &quot;The Passion&quot; is, however, at its strongest when it focuses on the basic humanity of its characters--I was especially moved by the relationship between Jesus and his mother (Maia Morgenstern).

Gibson's Jesus suffered so stoically that his ordeal seemed more an inconvenience than sacrifice. In fact all of the characters seemed stripped of any humanity and emotion. At least the Bowie-esque Satan and T. Rex-like Herod added some glam rock camp to the proceedings (maybe Lou Reed should have played Pilate). As a fan of Roman history and considering Mr. Gibson's beliefs I was expecting to find the film overly pious. I wasn't expecting a film so overblown, bloated and silly (what was that werewolf that growled at Judas, and the demon baby that looked like Uncle Fester?).Shallow, self-indulgent, and murky to the point of meaningless, this film would have had a hard time making it into theatrical release without the Mel Gibson-fueled contoversies.",1,Jesus Christ Superstar without the singing,1094688000,"09 9, 2004",0.0049

Concerning o the negative media hype, we did not come out of the theater with a sense of hatred for Jews, Romans, or anyone else. Quite the contrary - my wife was moved to tears several times, and while I did not cry, I certainly gained an even greater appreciation of what Jesus Christ did for us!Yes, the movie did contain some of the Hollywood creativity you see in movies based on actual stories (did Jesus really stomp on a snake in the Garden of Gethsemane, and some other instances), but the movie was faithful to the biblical account of Jesus' death for the sins of the world and the Hollywood creativity did not detract from the film's essence. The film's setting (I think it was filmed somewhere in Europe) and atmosphere were also very powerful.While some people have problems with the movie's violent content (some people left the theater early when we went), Jesus' death was extremely violent. Since Jerry Springer can let skeletons come out family closets and Hollywood can produce movies full of illicit sex, foul language, and mind-numbing violence, then why should a portrayal of the crucifixion be sanitized? The viewer's emotions are aroused and the person is challenged to really think about what he or she believes in terms of Jesus Christ and His claims. In short, the movie accomplishes what it sets out to do and is much more than just mere Hollywood entertainment.The only complaint I have with the movie is the emphasis on the crucifixion and not enough on the resurrection. Of course, if Mel Gibson produces a sequel on Christ from the resurrection to His ascension, then this complaint is irrelevant (and I hope so too).For the Christian: see the movie or buy or rent the dvd and be encouraged that you have a present and future hope in Jesus Christ!For the non-Christian: expect to be aroused emotionally and challenged intellectually about what you believe concerning Jesus Christ and Who He said He was and is!",5,An Inspirational Movie of Hope for All!,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",-0.1873

Has America become a fascist state? Is the United States of America under Communist control? That would appear so with the immense outcry against Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ from the Jewish community who believes this will result in a resurgence of anti-Semitic feelings amongst the movie-going public, a claim that has no justification. Too many people in this country have fallen for the liberal lie of Separation of Church and State which does not exist in any shape or form in the United States Constitution. The only thing that comes close to that is the Establishment Clause which states that federal government will not choose any religion for the basis of its country nor will it restrict religious freedom. Hmmm ... That's funny! Doesn't sound like our country today, now does it? The liberals of this country view Christianity as pot religion, one that can be pushed around and restricted without so much as a peep from the believers. God forbid this film rejuvenates religious moral values in this country!The story, although based mostly on the Bible, has more of an association with The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ written by St. Anne Catherine Emmerich and St. Mary of Agreda's The Mystical City of God, two sources that Gibson used directly while writing the script for the film. Jesus of Nazareth is known to his followers as a teacher and as the messiah of the Jewish people, whom prophets claimed would come and redeem them from original sin, but to his enemies, namely the Jewish High Priests and the Roman occupiers, he is a religious and political threat. A threat that must be gotten rid of as soon as possible before he creates an uprising, one that has been looming the horizon since the Roman Empire took control many years ago. So in the middle of the night, the High Priests arrest Jesus and in the morning present him to the Roman governor of Palestine, Pilate. Both he and King Herod find nothing to charge the man with but the Jewish people call for the prisoner to be crucified. In an effort to appease the crowd and prevent a riot, Pilate condemns Jesus to death. From there Jesus is forced to march through an angry mob while carrying his cross, nailed to that cross, and to die on that cross only to rise again, according to Christian beliefs, and save mankind from sin. The story for The Passion of the Christ sticks very true to its source, the Bible, and for that Mel Gibson should be praised not only for his accuracy in what he beliefs but also for not appealing to the unrelenting masses crying of anti-Semitism. In what was seen in the film, The Passion is more anti-Italian then anything else. There is no instance anywhere within the film that points directly to anti-Semitism; in fact it is the direct opposite. When the Jewish High Priests meet in the middle of the night to decide what to do with Jesus, two of the High Priests proclaim that the man is innocent and he should be set free but they quickly pushed away by the leader of the group. There are many other such moments that should all but silence the joke-of-a-claim made by Jewish leaders who have no idea what they are arguing against, let alone what is in the film.Instead of focusing on each member of the cast, all of which performed exceptionally well, let's concentrate more on the individual characters the actors and actresses portrayed on screen. Jesus Christ is portrayed in graphic detail through the emotionally driven performance of James Caviezel and the implacable choreograph of Mel Gibson. Jesus is portrayed exactly as he is in the Bible as a man of tremendous power who is beaten down by those who are, in actuality, lower then he is and yet he continues to press forward the message of forgiveness and love, not revenge. Maia Morgenstern conveys such an expressive motherly aura about her that when she performs on screen next to Jim Caviezel, it is utterly heart-wrenching to witness and could bring even the most virile of individuals to tears. Mary Magdalene, performed by Monica Bellucci, is once again misrepresented as a former prostitute whom Jesus saved from being stoned to death, which is a great misinterpretation that even today has gone unchanged. Unfortunately the story about Jesus saving the prostitute comes before Mary Magdalene is officially introduced in the Bible and therefore is often misunderstood. Rosalinda Celentano, who portrays Satan, gives a haunting performance that owes much to Gibson's vision of how he wanted the ruler of Hell to be represented in the film.Overall, The Passion of the Christ is quite possibly the most gut-wrenching, vicious and gore-filled interpretation of Jesus' death but at the same time it is the most emotionally-driven and praiseworthy one as well. The radical liberals and uptight religious leaders may lead many to believe that this adaptation of the gospels will cause anti-Semitic feelings but don't listen to single word they say because it is a flat-out lie! If people leave this feeling angry at the Jews then they have obviously missed the message Gibson and the Bible itself have tried to express, and therefore the filmmakers should not be held responsible for their foolish actions. Others claim that the feature is too violent and, once again, people have missed the point. Any interpretation of the death of Jesus should be graphic and the more violent it is, the more expressive the message of forgiveness and love should be. The only problem that could be seen in the feature was the inclusion of children representing demons, which just came off as being a little too awkward to be taken seriously, as well as the too many jump moments in the beginning, which came off as being too thriller-ish then anything else. Other then that, The Passion of the Christ is a definite must-see for both Christian and Non-Christians alike. Even if you aren't Christian, you will absolutely embrace the emotionally driven story and its clear-cut message that transcends religious barriers.",4,The Moose Hole - Gibson Shows His 'Passion',1077753600,"02 26, 2004",-0.1089

Braveheart was a beautifully directed cinematic masterpiece done by him and writter Randal Wallace. It is a movie that depicts not only war, revenge and violence....it tells a story of a bond shared between two humans that could never broken not even after the death of one of them. It made me cry and feel pride for those who would be brave enough to take on a force stronger than anything in the Eastern Hemisphere, (at the time) the British Empire. Braveheart is about ambition, love and courage. Mel Gibson created a wonderful film.Sadly to say once more, The Passion of the Christ offers nothing more than violent images. I could sense nothing dramatic nor touching about the film.The beauty and passion and love of Jesus wasn't his last hours alive and how he was nailed to a cross and left to die. His passion and love was the time he was alive.If this movie wanted to show the great man Jesus really was, it shouldve shown more scenes of his teachings and love shown toward his fellow man. Its stupid to think that people are lashing out against Mel Gibson's movie, calling it innacurate and anti-semitic. This is a man's opinion and free will shown on the big screen and anyone with artistic feelings would appreciate that. Free will and creativity is a wonderful gift that God gave us, and Mel Gibson didn't manipulate it, this is just his vision and doesn't make him blasphemic or evil.Still I can't find anything worth while about his movie because it lacks important events of the greatest man that ever lived.The way the movie was shot was excellent but the story line was weak and ostintacious.

The Passion of the Christ is a gutsy but lackluster attempt to dramatize the final 12 hours of Jesus' life, from his prayers at Gethsemane until his death on the cross. It is a heavily embellished account -so much so that it is doubtful that it could all happen within 12 hours. This is really a bring your own context film. Those who don't know the story of Jesus' life won't be able to make heads or tails of The Passion. The character of Mary Magdelene (Monica Bellucci), for example, gives the impression of being Jesus' sister, or perhaps another family member, not his follower. And Jesus (Jim Caviezal), himself, impresses as harmless and probably crazy when taken out of context, not as a credible threat to Jewish orthodoxy. We never see the intelligence or charisma that made this man legendary. The film is subtitled. All characters speak in dubiously accented Latin and/or Aramaic. But the facility with which the actors work in languages that they don't speak is interesting. -As are the film's colors. Actually, the colors are quite dull, but many scenes have an overwhelming blue or, more commonly, brown tone. The most notable aspect of The Passion is its haunting, prominently featured score by John Debney. The fact that The Passion of the Christ is a spiritual inspiration for some of its audience is proof of its cinematic value, however. In order to arouse the emotions of its audience, a film must be doing something right for some people.Much of The Passion of the Christ has the quality of a vivid dream sequence. Its flashbacks, bizarre devil imagery, haunting soundtrack, long silences, and strange color casts give the impression of something that is not to be taken literally. There is meticulous attention to historical accuracy in some things, while in other matters accuracy is inexplicably flaunted: Jewish children wearing skull caps, nails driven into hands instead of wrists, an unrealistic time frame, Jesus and Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov) conversing in Latin, Monica Bellucci is old enough to be Mary Magdalene's mother, and she too often uncovers her flowing hair in public. Modern films are held to pretty high standards for historical accuracy in their appearance, although not in the behavior of characters. So it puzzled me that director Mel Gibson fell down on minor points that would not have detracted from the film in any way had they been more accurate, when he went so far as to have the characters speaking their native languages. Gibson, true to form, exaggerated the violence beyond what is described in the Gospels. There are only about 13 minutes of intense violence in the film, but it is presented for maximum effect. The Passion of the Christ is highly impressionistic in that it depicts and, indeed, extrapolates the elements of Jesus' last day on Earth that have meaning for screenwriters Benedict Fitzgerald and Mel Gibson, as manifested in their imaginations.The Passion of the Christs opening sequence isn't its best, but it illustrates one reason the film fell flat for me. The scene of Jesus imploring God to spare him in Gethsemane is entirely blue and so melodramatic that I could do nothing but laugh, I'm afraid. Of course this is a matter of interpretation and style. But people don't really act like that. It was a sign of more melodrama to come. The Passions melodrama is so heavy that it made me apathetic to even the most extreme suffering. It places the film's emotions beyond a realistic plane. A lot of the audience, Christians included, will find Jesus' behavior bewildering. He seems to deliberately incriminate himself before the Pharisees and all but asks for more torture from the Romans. He invites suffering, as if he were a masochist. All I can say is that the film is thoroughly Athanasian. To make a long story short for those who don't know, Athanasian Christianity emphasized the suffering of God, in the form of Jesus, to redeem the souls of humans. It was adopted as Christian orthodoxy in the 4th century. The emphasis on suffering is diminished in Protestant and many modern Catholic practices. But if Athanasian Christianity is your thing, The Passion of the Christ is your movie. Whether mainline Christians will appreciate The Passions theology is another matter. The implication that someone deserves to have his eye pecked out because he mocked Jesus demonstrates a different value system entirely from Forgive them. They know not what they do. Ultimately, I found the monotonous persecution of one man for 2 hours to be, frankly, boring.The DVD: The are no bonus features, but there is an optional commentary for the visually impaired. A narrator recounts everything that happens on screen, including descriptions of the camera perspective, for the entire film. He even reads the credits. It's eloquent and well-done.

While others are saying that the film gives off an anti-semtic feel. Well, I had the pleasure of seeing Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ opening night, and I must say that it is one of the most powerful, moving, and violent films that I have ever seen in my life. For two hours, I was glued to the screen. I have never felt such a confliction of my emotions before. Part of me was disgusted at the violence and the overall treatment of Jesus. While the other part of me was amazed at how accurate the film was, and how well the film was captured on screen. Now some people might complain because there is not one word of english spoken in the entire film. However, the film is suprisingly easy to follow, and after the first 30 minutes you don't even realize the film is not in english anymore.James Caviezel continues to amaze me. He was brilliant in Frequency and The Count of Monte Cristo. But he was perfect in the role of Jesus. He not only looked the part, but he also brought the part to life. Every action of his on screen, made you feel for the character. It has to be one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen in my life. Maia Morgenstern was excellent as Mary as well. She accurately portrayed the love and sorrow that Mary felt for her son. There are two things about this film that might be confusing to the average movie-goer. The first is that the film showcases the last 12 hours of Jesus's life starting with the betrayal of Judas and ending with the crucifixtion. For those who don't know the history behind Jesus, it might be a tad bit confusing because there is no backstory. Mel Gibson did this because he wanted to focus on the most powerful and disturbing part of Jesus's life. The second is with the character Satan. You see Satan throughout the film, but it is never really made clear who he is. To the average person, he justs looks like one of the crowd dressed in black. I would have liked it, if there was more exploration into the character.Overall, the performances given and the accurate portrayal of events make The Passion of Christ a masterpiece that everyone should see.

This is not for the Christian novice.Many characters are never identified by name, and certain scenes are depicted in almost cinematic shorthand...when you see the feet of Jesus in an empty courtyard, with a few dozen rocks strewn about and the hand of a woman reaching for Jesus...you are supposed to know the whole thing about the adulteress, the ye without sin casting stones, etc.My take on the material was in noting that this is a story of the ultimate religious persecution. Here is the person with the ultimate religious conviction. He does not only believe in the Son of God and the Messiah, he believes he IS said person.For those beliefs, he clearly suffers the ultimate punishment, and is the victim of the most severe form of religious intolerance.Just my little interpretation.Overall, I felt exhausted and spent by the end of what felt like a four-hour movie.

It shows what happened and does not send any message that Jews are solely responsible for Jesus' crucifixion. We as humans are responsible and the movie conveys that. Anyone who blames Jews for Christ's crucifixion is warped simply because the Jews just happened to be the people which Jesus appeared before and Judaism was a religion with a large population much like itself and Christianity today. It was more than likely the best possible group for Jesus to preach to since his teachings would spread over such a large population.The movie's purpose was to show how much Christ suffered both physically and emotionally during the final 12 hours of his life. The movie definitely accomplished that goal, however, it did not provide any spiritual feel. Reason being simply that most if not all movie's which depict Christ are not always accurate to the Bible and are often interpretations of the producer as to what happened. An example on Gibson's part is his use of the Devil.The movie shows how cruel and hypocritical we as people can be, especially when the crowd shouts Crucify him despite his already immense suffering and when just 5 days earlier people in Jerusalem were greeting Jesus with Palms (this image is shown in the movie, which to me was the most powerful). Finally, the ending (Christ's Resurrection) was too brief in that Gibson doesn't show Christ appearing before the disciples bringing them joy and hope and misses out on the main point of Christ's suffering and death (which is to defeat death by death).Overall, the movie was good, but only in spurts. It had both well done and poorly done images. Some people may say that this movie is spiritual, but those people who say it is spiritual are the ones who are deeply affected by gore and visuals. But to me, going to Church and witnessing the Crucifixion on Holy Thursday (at least in Orthodox Churches) and reading the gospel give you a much more spiritual feel.The movie is definitely worth seeing, but it is just what I said, an okay movie.

It is difficult to see this as a film, when really it is an experience that, like it or not, you are immersed in for two hours and come out physically and emotionally drained, even if you found yourself without expression the entire time. the film, er... experience enraptures you almost immediatetly, as the film picks up the Garden of Gesthemine. Jesus (Jim Cavielzel) is in fear of what he must do, but finds himself tempted by a strange, female androgynous form of Satan. Seductive and oddly sexy, Lucifer, with an alluring, otherworldy voice tempts Jesus to turn from his path, but Jesus stays the course, accepting the arrest by Jewish guards. Condemed by the Jewish council for blasphemy, Jesus is taken before Pilate for punishment. pilate initially finds no cause for death, and instead orders Jesus whipped. This is where the violence and gore kick in. Jesus' back and torso is methodically ripped apart by Roman chastisers, and director Mel Gibson focuses on all the gory details, with close-ups of flesh coming off in shreds and the claws often come dangerously close to his face. Add to this a graphic walk with the cross (he is whipped repeatedly with a belt) and an even worse crucifixtion (complete with nails driven into Jesus' hand and feet, accompianied by squish sound effects and aa theif's eye pecked out by a crow), and the violence is often too much, bringing the audience out of the emotional juggernaut and leaving them instead with nausea.But the films' saving grace is Romanian actress Maia Morgernstern as Jesus' mother Mary. I am a congregational protestant, and never gave Mary the same amount of reverance Catholics do. But now I may. Morgenstern is the films' heart and soul, amid the films' unrelenting gore. She is the human mother watching her only son beaten and tortured to death. She is the main focus in the films' most powerful and moving scene when Jesus falls carrying the cross and she flashes back to an event in his childhood, whe she was able to comfort him and shleter him from pain. The humaness of Mary is what is relatable in the film (Cavielzel doesn't act as much as offer himself up as a sacrifical lamb) as the helpless mother, and Morgenstern's stoic yet anguished performance is one of the most heart-breaking you will ever see, and is the most haunting aspect of The Passion, rising above the film's off-putting violence.",4,At Times Passionate,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",-0.2422

I came out more educated about how Christians view religion and how their views differ from those of Muslims.Mel Gibson has packaged the common beliefs of his contemporary generation about Christianity in a commercial and artistic production with total disregard to the essence of any religion. He emphasizes the torture and persecution of a prophet and brutality and prejudice of his tormentors without shedding any light on the mission of the prophet. The movie portrays Christ as a psychotic man being punished by an angry community for blaspheming their faith in an almighty supreme God.Thus, the movie leaves one with the impression of sympathizing with a poor, persecuted man without explaining why his mission is worth believing in. The movie also portrays the Romans to be more civilized than the Jews of those days for their resistance to punish a poor man for his beliefs.The movie widens the gap between Christianity and other religions, one for reducing a holly prophet to the level of an insane man, and two for stressing on the common obsession among Christians of the person of the prophet instead of his deeds, mission, and wisdom. All Muslims believe that their prophets (including Jesus, Ibraham, Moses, and Muhammad) died as men like the rest of us and only their missions will remain alive because of its applicability to everyday matters.

Jesus is arrested, not long after that, his mother Mary, tells his wife Mary Magdalene that her instint senses something wrong.Later they find out that Jesus has been arrested, and the Jews are now surrounding Jesus, they yell at him for claiming that he was the son of God or the Messiah. Then Judas starts feeling very guilty and even has the devil stocking him, the next day Judas hangs himself in shame. Also that day the Jews turn Jesus over to the Romans, and they for some stupid reason choose to relase a sadistic, ugly, cycloptic murder over the gentil handsome Jesus.Later on, Jesus is getting the crap beat out of him, then he's whipped so many times, then he has to carry his own cross on his back. And the Roman solders are pretty drunk from what I could see. Oh and it gets much more worst from here on, while Jesus is carrying his cross on his back, the Romans are whipping him even more, and he trips. Then they order a common man to help him carry the cross. At first he refuses, but then ends up feeling sorry for him in the end, just like a lot of other people.Then Jesus is nailed to the cross and just sits up there asking God to forgive the Jews and the Romans for killing him, and just when he thinks that God has abadoned him, he dies.SPOLIERS END HEREI would like to say that watching this movie has made me feel very confused inside. But there are some obvious things to point out though.1. When it came to Jesus getting tortured, of course I felt sorry for him, regardless of weither or not he was just a common man or the Son of God. And you can see how hard it was for Mary his mother to see her son suffer, and how hard it was for her to lose him. That could be said of anyone who has ever lost a child. But let's put it to you this way, if you don't want to see Jesus Christ get tortured, then don't watch this film. When watching a typical film, I could probably only stand to see someone get torchered for a half an hour, but not two hours, espically if it's Jesus. That poor guy didn't even shout a single insult at anyone, even when everyone chose the murder to be let go over him.2. It didn't just show Jesus getting tortured, it also showed flashbacks of him helping people and asking them to forgive and love their enemies. I'm glad that Mel Gibson did put those flashbacks in there.3. Now for the most contraverasial point I would like to bring up. First off I don't think that anyone should just go pointing fingers at the Jews, it not only sounds anti-Semetic, but you also left out an important detail, that the Romans were the ones who ordered the execution of Jesus Christ. Think about the time that this happeend, back then if anyone claimed to be the Son of God then yes he's very likely to die, it was as risky as Joan of Arc claiming that she could talk to God. Plus don't forget that the Romans were in charge of Israel at the time this happened, and don't also forget that the Romans believed in many Gods, so they probably would have put Jesus to death anyways.4. And not all the Jews were against Jesus either, most of his followers were Jewish, and I can only recall one of them that betrayed Jesus, that was Judas. Paul may have looked like he betrayed Jesus, but in the end Jesus forgave him, because he knew that if Paul would have backed him up, then he too would have died. And I don't think that Jesus wanted to put his followers in jepordy, otherwize, who would be left to preach Jesus's teachings? Also Mary Jesus's mother was a Jew, and his so-called wife Mary Magdalene was a Jew, so were they against him? I also saw that some of the Jews actually felt sorry for him when he was walking with his cross on his back.5. One last important detail, Jesus was a Jew, so anyone who hates Jews probably hates Jesus too.That's all I have to say, and with all that said and done, I have nothing else to say, except, if you want to watch a very powerful film like The Passion of the Christ then do so.",4,"A Very, Very Contraversial Religous Film Indeed!",1223164800,"10 5, 2008",-0.1991

Gibson takes a good amount of creative license (and rarely passes up an opportunity to slam non-belivers) but most of the time I like his creative choices. Particularly the flashbacks (which are not in the source material) of younger Jesus and his mother.Is it an Anti-Semitic film? Only if you focus on the &#34;bad Jews&#34; and ignore the fact that EVERY ONE of Jesus's supporters are also Jewish. Pilot is practically a saint in this version; torn between conscious and duty, which is a Gibson choice that is historically inaccurate, but one that is necessary for the film's narrative. Don't look to this film for a history lesson, but rather a version of the story that shows how confident Jesus was in his mission.Bloody? Yeah, we could have done without some of it. But it's nothing we have not already seen in gangster films, and Spartacus. I take a way one star for that. and one-half star for historical inaccuracy. (Amazon will not allow half-star reviews so I rounded up)Gibson choices that I didn't like:1) Barabus looks like a retard when history has confirmed that he was a calculating Zealot leader against the Romans. Gibson's deviation to fashion Barabus a fool makes the mob calling for his freedom over Jesus look ridiculous and robs the audience not familiar with history of the significance of the crowd's reason for this choice.2) Herod acts like a young child when history has shown that was a very crafty politician whose alliance with Rome gave the region prosperity and quazi-independence over the iron fist of Rome. Gibson's choice here robs the audience not familiar with history of understanding why Herod MUST hand Jesus back to Pilot and offers only that Herod is displeased with Jesus because he will not perform parlor-trick miracles. Bad choice Mel. Give your audience a bit more credit.Over all, if you can wade through the historical inaccuracies (which I can forgive b/c let's face it, movies are just one person's view) this is really a great piece of filmmaking and one that I personally did not find offensive for non-believers.

This movie is about the last twelve hours of Jesus' life. In some points of the movie, it goes back in time with Jesus and his apostles before he was captured and crucified. It is terrifyingly gruesome and depressing, but it is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. I like how they make it as realistic as possible with the language they speak. They speak Aramaic, an ancient language which was used by Jesus and everyone else at that time. The language is now considered as the dead language. The language is close to Hebrew. So there are subtitles throughout the whole movie. They are not many words in this movie. It is mostly the pain Jesus went through for us. The movie is very well done, Mel Gibson should be proud. This not, however a movie you will watch every single day, that would be too much to handle. I think people who don't want to go see this movie, but think they have to, don't. It is really not a required thing to do for yourself. A lot of people would not be able to handle this movie, especially kids. I'm thirteen and saw this movie and it was the most gruesome thing I have ever gone through in my life. This movie does not give you a good feeling when you leave the theatre.

647,A1NMUSODK9RHAT,310263662,Mr. Maybe,"[2, 4]","I'm going to warn you now...I am reviewing this film as an OBJECTIVE MOVIE-GOER, not a religious zealot. If you think just because of the subject matter this film should be considered immune from criticism, it may be best to skip my words here.For those of you still with me...This film could have been so good, yet falls short in so many ways. First of all, though not devoutly religious, I have no doubt that Christ existed and have read the Gospels. Religion, especially in film, is so subjective, it's nearly impossible to classify it in any conventional sense. This film is obviously driven by Mel Gibson's undeniable faith, and at times it shines brightly. I give it high marks for intensity, but I wouldn't call it moving or spiritually enlightening.First of all, the good: the subtitles are an excellent device. I thought it offered great authenticity to what could be defined as the single most revered day in history. Technically, I thought the cinematography, visual effects and score were also excellent. The roles of Jesus, Pilate and Mary were well done for the most part. In fact, perhaps the most captivating part of the film was the relationship between Jesus and Mary, though even that was barely touched upon. And again, the relationship between Pilate and his wife Claudia were better captured than the compassion for Christ.The bad: Just about everything else. In terms of a film, we expect an arc of story, or a plot. This film offers none. It's not a story, it's a sequence. Had Gibson focused more on Christ and who He was and what He taught, this film would have packed way more of a punch. It also might have sent a more profound message instead of what I took it as, which is sheer guilt.The acting, especially on the parts of the Romans, seemed very forced and cartoon-ish. The Jewish high priests were also one dimensional. The bloodshed, though at first effective, quickly became the focus of the film instead of why we should care that it's happening. I don't think that the bloodshed was unnecessary, but certainly excessive and over the top. It's good to see the darkest aspects of what Christ endured, but there comes a point where all Gibson's doing is establishing that torment, over and over and over. Nothing moves forward, it's just regurgitation.Gibson doesn't offer any reason for us to care what's happening. I found myself relating to it strictly from a humanity standpoint, where I sympathized with Jesus only out of compassion for his physical endurance. But I felt the same for Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, where he plays the part of a convicted rapist and murderer condemned to death. Hmmm, what's wrong with this picture?As an example of misdirection, instead of making the March to Golgotha scene several minutes long, shorten it up. Use the rest of that time to COMPLETE the scenes of the Last Supper, or the Sermon on the Mount. These snippet scenes, that consist no more than 15-20 seconds each, are the only link to who Christ was or allowed me to feel connected spiritually. But the second I was compelled by that, it's back to the torture and bloodshed. I'm sorry, but that's just HORRIBLE writing and directing. Seriously.I think my biggest complaint is the message here, which is guilt, guilt, guilt. Regardless of Gibson's intent, that's all that was conveyed as far as I'm concerned. I interpret the teachings of Christ to be that of love, forgiveness and peace. And though there are glimmers (and I mean glimmers) of those teachings in the film, they are too sparse to compensate for the bloodshed. And though I am familiar with the Gospels and understood everything that was happening, from beginning to end, I still left scratching my head. Bottom line, if you're not familiar with the story of Christ and His death, this is a very hollow film.And to quickly touch base on all of the controversy this film has stirred, here's my two cents: I don't think the film is anti-Semitic. I didn't have a hard time with the gore or bloodshed. I think it's pretty strange to read people's reviews that INSIST you take your kids to see this film, and it should be used as a teaching device, when really, it teaches NOTHING about who Christ was, or what He taught.I commend Gibson for his faith and vision to bring something to life that has affected his life in profound ways. THAT is truly amazing, and in my opinion, the very essence of faith and what it can do to mend souls. But in terms of a commercial film to be shown to the masses, there's really not a whole lot here.I wonder, would Christ Himself approve of this film's focus? I highly doubt it.",3,So much potential squandered...,1217462400,"07 31, 2008",0.1187

649,AOWQ2SLNTZIJ4,310263662,Mr. Robinson theo deo,"[4, 12]","Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ was probably one of the most controversial films of the year 2004. The film had many critics of all stripes praising or damning the work for a variety of different reasons.The most common criticism concerned Gibson's treatment of the Jewish authorities who demanded Jesus' death. This being a cinematic version of a Passion Play, staged shows depicting the suffering and crucifixion of Jesus, presented around Easter during the Middle Ages on. These productions were notorious for placing the blame of Jesus' death on the Jews and would reportedly lead audience members to track down Jews with harmful intent. Many feared the film would reignite the same sorts of emotions early passion plays had.I'm not sure if I feel qualified to judge the film on the grounds of whether there were undercurrents of antisemitism in its images and portrayals. Others also stated how the film was a sort of sadomasochistic torture fantasy revealing more about the demons in Mel Gibson's mind than any insights into Christ's sacrifice.While these were all valid criticisms, not many of the mainstream reviewers seemed to really critically focus on the theology of what the film was centered around. This, for me, was where the real problem with the film lie; in the theology it was celebrating.At the heart of traditional and popular Christian belief, is the idea that Jesus came into this world with the purpose of living a sinless life so he could offer himself up as perfect sacrifice for everyone's sins. As popular and as accepted as this theology is, it is warranted a closer inspection.It basically suggests that God, in order to forgive us and restore us to Paradise after our fall from grace as it were, needed a perfect sacrifice as we could not hope to make such an offering on our own. This blood offering was needed or we would all be under God's impending wrath. Culturally, this may have made sense over 2000 years ago, but does it do so now?As Darwin's theory of evolution shows, we were never perfect to begin with, we're not finished, to paraphrase Bishop John Shelby Spong. This is probably partially why the theory is such a threat to so many fundamentalist believers, as it implies that we didn't need a saviour to restore us to grace. Though, I should point out that many feel evolution and traditional Christian theology surrounding the atonement are compatible, I have never fully understood it.It paints God as an angry and cruel parent wanting the blood sacrifice of his own son in order to spare us his wrath. As one writer notes, its almost as if Jesus dies to save us, not from sin, but from his own Father. Seen through that lens, one gets the sense that this image of God is more bloodthirsty than loving.However, the film is a no holds barred portrayal of that form of atonement in action. Before Jesus is scourged, he lets his Father know his heart is ready for what will happen. Therefore, while being whipped (endlessly) I almost felt that the scourgers were mere pawns as God himself was directing this abuse towards his own son.Many feel a sense of love when contemplating this view of Jesus' death and thus will not like the view I have taken. That's fine. I simply feel the view I have shared was not expressed by critics enough, and felt a need to share it myself.The film itself is gorgeous to look at with great cinematography and a moving score. The actors all handle their dialogue and characters effortlessly, which must have been difficult speaking in another language.But, the film's emphasis on gore and showing it how it was really numb the senses. Its hard to focus on much else when all one sees is whips striking Christ's back over and over again.In the end, I left the theater asking, why would an almighty and all powerful God, with powers and abilities beyond our comprehension choose the most violent means by which to transact grace and forgiveness.

Gibon's Mel Against the World attitude was a brilliant marketing ploy that paid off well for Gibson.This review comes not from a left wing atheist; I am a proud Christian. With all the controversy surrounding this film, I expected to feel something, after seeing it. I expected to feel appreciation, pain, disgust, or outrage, or to maybe even be offended.What happened was beyond my wildest imagination; I left the theater thinking Was that any good? After a while it hit me; after this film was over, I felt NOTHING. Now I'm not the most callous person in the world; I cried at the end of MIRACLE when the US beat the Soviet hockey team. I even got misty eyed during THE RETURN OF THE KING.The violence in this film is way over the top, and just not realistic. A man could not stay conscious after loosing so much blood and being beaten with a cat of nine tails to the point where his ribs are exposed. Some would say He's the son of man- he could do anything. Yes he could- if he chose to. But God created him to respond to pain as a human would respond. That means he would have passed out after about ten or so lashes. Therefore, those whipping scenes have less to do with reality than some sick fetish of Mel Gibson.Many people say that after awhile, you become numb to the violence in this film. For me, it was actually worse than that; it became downright boring. As with everything in this film, its drastically overdone, to the point of having no effect at all.As much as I hate to admit it, the film's most engaging character is Satan. Maybe because he's the ONLY character who isn't screaming, crying, and/ or yelling and waving his fists in the air. His silent gaze has more potency than any hissing screaming or nashing of teeth.James Caviezal's performance as Jesus is another example of the film's over-reaching nature. In every frame of the film, he is so obviously ACTING, that we don't see Christ- we see Caviezal breaking his back trying to get an Oscar nod.

657,AB1OA9RKZZD62,310263662,Namyriah,"[4, 6]","I'm posting this review due to encountering - often - criticisms of The Passion that occur in books published 8 years after its release. Most of these are, oddly, Christian books, which accuse the movie of being too violent and making God look sadistic. Those accusations from unbelievers are understandable, but coming from Christians, they are bizarre.First of all, this is the first movie - ever - to show crucifixion in all its nastiness. If you read the Gospels, you know they don't provide details: simply They crucified him. The Gospels' original readers would've known just how horrible it was to die on a cross, suffering unfathomable pain before finally expiring. Movies like The Greatest Story Ever Told or King of Kings are good, in their way, but frankly we don't see any real pain - more like Jesus feeling a pebble in his sandals. Lots of paintings from the Middle Ages and Renaissance do capture some of what Jesus actually endured, but Gibson in fact did the world a great service by showing just how gory it was. By the way, some reviewers - both Christian and not - condemned Passion's violence but (inconsistently) praised the realistic violence of movies like Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. Quentin Tarantino gets praised as an artist when he uses graphic violence, but Gibson, who made it clear he had a motive other than profit, got raked over the coal's for making a too-violent movie.I should mention here that, to my chagrin, lots of very devout Christians I know have avoided seeing this, and the usual excuse is I heard it's too violent. With all respect, that is the point: I can guarantee that seeing this movie will forever affect how you read the Bible and how hymns that refer to the cross take on a richer meaning. There is a surplus of feel-good religion around, and Gibson's movie is a necessary counter-weight to all the fluff. As I scroll through some Amazon reviews by people who say they are Christians but found the movie too violent, I'm wondering if the really saw it. Everyone I know, personally, who saw it had a very different reaction - not Ooh, that was SO violent! but Now I understand what Jesus went through! And for the people who said they liked the movie but said Not for kids! I respectfully disagree. Kids, judging from their movies and video games, have a pretty high tolerance for violence, probably more than we adults do. I think Christians would do their kids a disservice by keeping them away from this movie, which shows what REAL violence is like - not cartoon fun, but thoroughly nasty. I think any kid who has seen this movie might feel a bit of emotion the next time he sings Jesus Love Me.I own the DVD of this movie and watch it every few months. My TV can't quite duplicate the experience of first seeing it in a theatre in 2004. I remember, about three minutes into the film, thinking He's filmed this like a horror movie - and for once the horror isn't an alien, vampire, werewolf, or serial killer - the horror is human evil, destroying a totally innocent man in brutal fashion. It's the one horror movie every Christian ought to see. People are so accustomed to crosses as wall decorations or as jewelry that they forget there was nothing visually appealing about a real cross.Jim Caviezel, who played Jesus, was probably the best screen Jesus ever. Granted, in some scenes the make-up seems to be more prominent than the man under it, but considering what Jesus endured, the make-up was hardly over the top. Based on my reading of the Gospels, I think Pilate in the movie is a bit too warm-hearted - but perhaps that was the point. If Pilate was shown as a thoroughly nasty character, his condemnation of Jesus would have seemed in keeping with his personality. But the movie depicts him in a good light, as a fair-minded sort - and so it seems all the more horrible when he caves in to the mob and orders Jesus crucified. The fellow playing Judas was superb - just the right guilty look, and, in the end, torn to pieces by what he has done. The priests are shown as bad characters - which they were - and yet Gibson allowed them to show just a sliver of emotion when they see Jesus on the cross, as if they're not absolutely certain they've done the right thing. They are not cardboard villains but, rather, human beings who have committed an atrocity. My favorite character, aside from Jesus, was Simon of Cyrene, the bystander who gets forced into carrying Jesus' cross and, as they progress toward Golgotha, finding himself more and more sympathetic with this bleeding, mangled victim of injustice.Using subtitles was a great idea. I've always thought that actors' accents create a problem in biblical movies - The Last Temptation of Christ being the textbook case. Having heard these characters speaking the actual languages of biblical times could have alienated audiences, but in fact did not. I think it added to the feel of this being a documentary. Wisely, the credits run at the end of the movie, not the beginning. Gibson knew how to set the mood.Regarding the end: I don't think it could have been done better. As a Christian (one whose life has been, to put it mildly, a cesspool since this movie was released), Gibson had to follow the crucifixion with the resurrection. But he shows us as little as possible - all to the good, since the Gospels tell us very little about how it actually occurred. Having sat through the horror - I recall a lot of sniffing in the theatre - the payoff, as in the Gospels, is that God raises up Jesus to new life. We see the risen Jesus just a few seconds, but it's enough - the happy ending that is part of the gospel.In regard to the accusation of anti-Semitism: that charge has been thrown at every Jesus movie since Cecil B. DeMille made King of Kings back in 1927. Frankly, I just don't see how anyone can believe that showing a group of Jewish priests in 1st-century Palestine as villains is going to make people today rush out and do nasty things to Jews. And I'm sure anyone who has seen the movie knows, the most brutal of the characters are the Romans.In short, if you haven't seen this, do - especially if you consider yourself a Christian but were put off by the Too violent! mantra. Yeah, it's violent - like real crucifixions.

I could suppose which character was Pontius Pilot, but could only guess who was King Herod. I could figure out which character was Jesus' mother Mary, and which was Mary Magdalene, but not if Joseph was even in the movie. The movie began right before Judas betrayed Jesus so it passed by a lot of material covered at the beginning of Jesus Christ Superstar. The movie ended right after Jesus' death while I had wished it would continue to His resurrection. However much Gibson had shown of what was physically done to Jesus, other than how he showed the depth of love both Mary's showed for Him, it left too many holes for me.

I won't go into a rundown of the plot since that has been done innumerable times, but if the movie showed Judas' suicide, I must not have been looking at he screen. I did enjoy the glimpses of Jesus' ministry work where we could see what he looked like before the Roman soldiers began having their fun. I also enjoyed the scenes with His mother and how much she loved him while a young boy, and now as a grown man put to unbelievable torture. I wondered if the soldiers' intent was to scourge him to death until an officer stepped in to stop them. I was pleased I could be mesmerized by Gibson's film without missing the songs that made up Jesus Christ Superstar. I also enjoyed hearing another language spoken though I had forgotten it was Armenian until I reread a review that reminded me of that. Despite the daring viewpoint of how much savagery was displayed by the punishers, little was made of how much He suffered during the crucifixion itself, though certainly the long walk, the driving in of the nails in His plams, and especially for me the attaching of His legs to the post were thoroughly co vered. When Jesus gave up His spirit to God, the storm that ensued well described God's way of communicating the great importance of what had taken place -- that His only-begotton Son had died for man's sins. Even so, I will still favor the more-watered down versions of this epoch.",3,I Was Left Wondering Who Was Whom,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",0.0152
659,A3HOF1OBYCV0I5,310263662,Nate Volkerding,"[7, 8]","I would like to write a little about this movie's critics: The typical newspaper or magazine column about The Passion has excoriated the movie, branding it a bloody, anti-semetic, sado-masochistic mess- they also usually manage to work in the word, pornographic. The movie is said to fail in not focusing on Jesus's life and his great moral teachings -the things that everyone can find agreement with. Mr Gibson is personally attacked as a religous wacko from the dark ages - that is, he literally believes the Christ myth, rather than taking the enlightened view that it is all a metaphor for the changing of the seasons- dark aspersions are cast upon him for his refusal to publicly rebuke his 85 year old father. In short, the typical review has taken a stern, one might almost say, puritanical, stance against violence in the cinema, and has attempted to instruct the Christians in the doctrines of Christianity while simultaneously (unconsciously or otherwise) rejecting them.I think it would be unfortunate if this movie were to become some sort of acid test for Christian belief. Undoubtedly, there are critics, who, for matters of personal taste or some other reason, will simply find this film unnappealing. These I think, though, are the relativly small minority. I believe that the rest of the film's negative critacism can be divided into two groups; those who openly and knowingly contest Christianity (a surprisingly small portion of this film's negative reviews come from those who plainly admit this), and those who simply have a quite egregiously poor understanding of what it means to be a Christian.With respect to the second group, they generally take the position that Christ was, first and foremost, a great moral teacher, and that Mr. Gibson has seriously erred in not concentrating on this aspect of his life. This position is a half truth, at best, I believe. There have been many great moral teachers, and, to a surprising degree, they have taught the same thing. Whether it was Plato or Confucius, we would doubtlessly all of us be much the better if we followed their teachings. We can't -at least none of us can very well or very consistently- that is the whole point. Chrisitianity is the most pragmatic of religions, it is the only one that knows man will fail. Even the very best among us make atrocious mistakes; we all wrong ourselves, each other and God in and to a quantity and degree that is simply unforgivable. If this were not so then the passion would have been unnecessary. Without the passion, Christianity is meaningless.To look at the moral teacher assertion from another angle, it is merely wrong. Most people, even non-Christians, accept that the words of Jesus are those of a great moralist. But what other great moralist claims to be mankind's saviour? To paraphrase C.S. Lewis, this leaves us with few options. We can accept that Jesus is who he claims to be, or else we must come to the conclusion that he is a raving lunatic, or, indeed, something much worse than that.There is, behind all this, this desire to have Christ without the cross, an unwillingness and a distinct discomfort towards accepting human nature for what it has become. After all, at some times, on some levels, I've probably convinced myself that I was basically a decent guy. Most of us really are more good than we are bad, aren't we? No, actually, we aren't -a history book, or even an honest self examination ought to make that readily and abundantly clear. Every earthly, utopian scheme mankind has cooked up or ever will, breaks on his own nature. The modern person has no difficulty with Christ as a hippy, who sings Broadway songs about love and peace. The Christ who died an excruciating death so that our sins might be cleaned -the idea that this modern person might have any sins that cannot be cleansed with an honest apology or a card and flowers. Or, to go even farther, the idea that sin is anything more than an antiquated human invention(!) - seems to have a puzzling, rather infuriating effect on our hypothetical modern person.This review is getting quite long, but I'd like to write a couple more personal thoughts on the movie before I finish.I should maybe say, as regards myself, that I was raised a very nominal Lutheran. I was for a long while an agnostic with a rather low opinion of Christians. It was only after reading Plato's Socratic dialougues that I was able conceive an understanding of God that made any sense to me, and it's only been even more recently yet that I've come to reconcile that understanding with Christianity. In short, I must admit, it is a rather airy, conceptualized faith that I hold to.There is one image from this film that remains in my mind days after viewing. Christ stands mutilated, wearing the crown of thorns, looking out into the leering crowd. Here the expression is simultaneously of mute defiance and acceptance; he stands as the living truth, in defiance of man, what man has become and what man will yet do, and in acceptance of what He must do. Mr. Gibson's film was, to me, the first clear, visceral view of something I believe I've felt and understood in only a fleeting way. With regards to this, to again paraphrase Mr. Lewis, I cannot help but feel that there is such a thing as getting more than you bargained for.This is a relentless, brutal film, and that is maybe the one thing which everyone who sees it will agree on. Mr. Gibson has shown no mercy to his audience; he ignores their culture, the age they live in, their sensibilities, even their language in attempting to present the truth. By making a movie that is superficially alien and unspecific to any group of people, he has made a film that is equally universal to all. Wheras church leaders today stress the importance of making the faith accessible, Mr. Gibson is clearly more concerned with persuading people to make themselves accesible to the timeless and unchanging truth. I walked away from the film convinced that this was it's end and final artistic goal, and God bless you for it, Mr. Gibson.",5,No milk and water for Mr. Gibson,1080000000,"03 23, 2004",0.1382

Let me explain.* It's extremely violent -- It's very disturbing how many times Jesus is hit in the court yard.* Mel Gibson is extremely good at directing films. The cinematography is excellent. The way the Jewish Sanhedrin is dressed, the way Caiaphas shouts. The fact it's done in Aramaic and Latin all the way through adds to the realism.* The music fits the scenes very well.* I love the first bit where it's dark and they are outside -- beautiful scenery!*IT HAS SUBTITLES ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT! -- IF YOU DON'T LIKE SUBTITLES, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM. But it's a shame, because it makes it so much more realistic!Jesus (they say Yeshua 'Mesheeiah' in the film) has flash backs throughout the film. On the mountain telling everybody to have love amongst themselves, the Passover, the woman caught in adultery (disputed part of the Bible) and playing around with the woman at the well.Despite it's inaccuracies towards history, the basic settings, feelings and attitudes betrayed through this movie is very accurate and it's like as if you are witnessing Jesus' last few hours before his painful and agonizing crucifixion.All Christians when just finishing watching this film would feel happy they are Christians. Any Christian, or Christian sect: Catholic, Anglican, Born Again, Greek Orthodox, 7th Day, Mormon or a Jehovah's Witness would love this film -- even though they would not admit what religious organization they'd come from!I love the way center on the role of Jesus as the Christ and his absolute love of God which he consistently calls father all throughout the film. Jesus is shown in the film as loving, kind, compassionate but also having a human side to his nature to him, which is exactly how he is betrayed in the Gospels, which is opposite to the movie The Ten Commandments mini-series (not to be mistaken for the 1950's classic by the same name!) which shows Moses from a human perspective far too much. The Passion was quite disturbing, but morally up building which is opposite to the 10 commandments miniseries -- I wasn't convinced by the acting, or the sets...The people in The Passion look Jewish, act Jewish and speak ancient languages. I could have imagined Pontius Pilate to be like that -- a typical European stature, bald head and with good reasoning ability.Strangely enough, I have a new way at looking at Judas -- the way he threw the money at Caiaphas showed how upset he was, and who knows if he will be resurrected. The whole experience was an extremely turbulent time. I felt sad for Peter who denied Jesus 3 times...WARNING: SPOILER!!! I don't often give away spoilers, but because this is a religious movie title, I thought I'd give my opinion on the fact the tail end of the movie was a bit short, and should have shown the doubting Thomas not believing that it really was Jesus unless he sees the print of the nails.I heard some weird rumor about the fact the divine name is used, which is complete nonsense. It would have been good if they did say Yahweh/Jehovah, or even Iabe... but it doesn't really matter because I realize it was done by a Catholic. Maybe they said YHWH, but probably missed it because I did watch the movie very late at night. But all for the better!I almost would want to go to church after seeing this movie and be Catholic myself! The connection between the Roman rule of Jerusalem and approximately 300 years when the Catholic faith historically started, the Christian religion would later become the state religion of the Roman empire. Thank God Constantine god rid of the crucifix when he became Christian!I don't know why Mel added the inaccuracies: like speaking Latin the the Jewish Sanhedrin crowds, the evil man on the cross having his eyes poked out by a bird, Satan as a woman (!) and so forth. But these weird apocryphal things don't spoil the passion for Jesus Christ.Great movie. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED: It's extremely violent and perhaps Jesus was beaten too much? Although, he was a perfect man, it would have taken a while to beat him nearly half to death as what happened to him in this movie. This movie was written by a man who has such a passion for Jesus, and is perhaps more symbolic in some places rather than historical and maybe he wanted to do this so we have more feelings for our king Jesus before he hands over his throne to the Father after the 1000 years. I hope Mel makes more films like this. How about a movie about The Acts of the Apostles, or A Revelation to John from the New Testament and use the book of Jude as an intro and having a flashback where Jesus is arguing with the devil over Moses' body. I am looking forward to his next film: Apocalypto, which is going to be released later 2006 about the Mayans before Columbus and their declining civilization. Great director!

663,AUH36NUNBVII8,310263662,Negombo Lo,"[10, 18]","A few thoughts:1. Not a film for the kiddies.2. In the bible, it's no big secret that Jesus (a Jew) was p*****g off the Pharisees (founders of modern day Judaism) by calling them liars and hypocrites, and showing them that their silly laws were leaving them in the dark ages. Fact is, Jesus' teachings were contrary to Judaism's - consequently he was a threat to the status quo. Jews have shown dissent among themselves for years over Judaism - why do you think they have Orthodox, Conservative and Reform sects, some with female(!) Rabbis? A female trying to be a Rabbi back then would have been dragged from the temple and stoned to death.3. Too far ahead of his time with his crazy ideas (shown in his actions more than in his words) about womens' rights, the rights of children, and God's law over mans', he was just too much of a threat. Due to the fear of the people in power at that time, they had him snuffed out. No big surprise, all of it is in the bible - why is then a portrayal (an accurate one at that) of Jesus' execution and the events leading up to it considered so controversial? It's been in the bible for centuries.4. It's not a feel good film. I felt drained after watching this exceptionally long torture session. I wonder if in fact Jesus went through everything TO THE EXTENT the movie depicts. Most of us would have been dead before the cross was handed to us. However, I have no doubt of the accuracy of the torture and beating scenes. The Jews living on Masada committed suicide rather than be captured by the Romans. This movie might give one an idea why.5. I am glad I saw it. Most religious films show an overly sweet Jesus with shlock like glowing robes, which leaves us with the impression that Jesus was somehow other worldly. He was, but he was also human. In most of these movies, we have no idea how brutal an execution like a crucifixion was. Now we know. There are also no glow in the dark eyes, kitschy halos or Romans talking in Shakesperian accents in Passion, thank you Mel.6. I felt neither angry nor anti-Semetic (I was raised a Catholic but dropped out at age 9) after watching this. It depicts human folly and the killing of an innocent man during some rather turbulent times. I am also technically (according to Jewish law) Jewish on my mom's side, and I didn't feel at all paranoid. To my Jewish friends who do feel that way, remember, this is not the 1100's or the 1930's. People are brighter than that now, give it a rest, ok?7. Main complaints - it dragged, I didn't feel good afterwards - though I wasn't supposed to - higher on brutality than on philosophy.

667,A3SU3TXON36T0X,310263662,New Age of Barbarism zosimos,"[5, 8]","Mel Gibson's _The Passion_ is a fascinating depiction of the sufferings of Christ from his encounter in the Garden of Gethsemani until his death on the Cross and burial in the tomb. The movie is nearly entirely in Aramaic (perhaps the original language of Christ) and Latin (for the Roman guards) with some subtitles. The resurrection is not covered in the movie; however, we do see glimpses of the coming invents in a renewed (bodily) Christ and Satan being bound in Hades. Mel Gibson is a traditionalist Roman Catholic who has attempted to restore a once well established tradition within the modern age, that of the Passion Play. During the Middle Ages, the Passion was routinely acted out in churches across Europe, revealing the inner secrets of Christ through this profound drama. Gibson bases his Passion on the Four Canonical Gospels (especially that of Matthew) and also on some of the visions of the Roman Catholic nun Venerable Catherine Anne Emmerich (who experienced visions which she recorded during a long illness, and supposedly lived for several years sustained upon the Holy Eucharist alone). The scenes from the movie are indeed surreal and they reveal the inner torments and struggles between God, the Father and Satan within the minds of Jesus Christ, Son of God and his betrayer Judas Iscariot (who tormented by demons will eventually be driven to hang himself). The movie features much from both the Bible and tradition and legend, including many references that are likely to be missed by those not familiar with both (for example, the serpent snapping at the heel of Christ who stamps upon its head, cf. Genesis). The movie also has the air of mystery and like the early Greek mystery cults the Passion and the subsequent Stations of the Cross serve as a mystery of the living Faith of Christ revealed in his death and resurrection. The Pharisees and high priests of the time are portrayed as truly wicked and serve a purpose only to mock and jeer at what they do not (indeed cannot) understand. Many have accused Mel Gibson of antisemitism, merely because he would not bend to the political correct ideals of the day and remove the troublesome passages from the Gospel accounts. Indeed, the world of First Century Palestine was very different from the world of today, but it is clear from both reading the Gospels and from seeing the movie based upon them who the real culprits are for the death of the Messiah. I think Mr. Gibson does a particular service to the modern era by revealing these truths which were once known to many (during the Middle ages) but which since have become buried and made esoteric courtesy of post-Enlightenment modernism. The movie is extremely gory, depicting sufferings on a level that may be incomprehensible to many. In fact, at many points during the movie (particularly during the more touching moments in which Jesus and his mother Mary were seen together or the moments with Mary Magdelene as well) I felt myself tearing up (often somewhat uncontrollable). The scourgings for example were particularly difficult to watch, and the actual act of nailing Christ to the Cross was very gruesome. You may have to turn your head away, but if you can you should probably watch what you can make it through so as to make it fully beyond this step of initiation into the Passion Play. The movie ends with Christ dead upon the Cross and being buried. At the moment of Christ's death, the sky is said to have darkened up and the Earth to have quaked and fissures opened up, also the dead and many saints were said to have risen from their graves. Some of this is depicted near the end of the movie. The movie does not show the Ressurection (which is unfortunate) leaving us off with a somewhat depressing picture of things, until the Easter season comes and reveals for us the fullness of Christ resurrected bodily and the redemption of mankind. The movie shows some interesting developments of the mass, including the work of Jesus Christ as a carpenter; however, it does not show an actual Roman mass - yet, it does preserve the exact words of Christ used to consecrate bread and wine during the transubstantiation. I do wish that Mr. Gibson had shown more of the details from the Bible account, more flashbacks for example, and more from the tradition and subsequent legend, and less gore, perhaps. However, I recognize that this would have been difficult to do given his constraints. Upon the bodily death of Christ upon the Cross, the spear of the Roman centurion Longinus is used to spear the side of Christ releasing water and blood from his body. A true miracle of God. Also, the movie depicts the salvation of the good thief at the Cross and the raven picking at the eye of the other thief. This movie represents a true return to the tradition of the Church and to the medieval Passion Play for modern day America. Perhaps more who watch this movie will be inspired by it, and see in it the Christianity of their youth which they have since either rejected or fallen away from. A true restoration of Christianity within America could indeed be a most glorious thing - and with the coming of the Easter season we shall once again witness renewed life.",5,"The Passion of Our Lord, Jesus Christ.",1079395200,"03 16, 2004",0.0397

Ever since I saw Pay it Forward, I saw something of Christ in Caviezel and hoped he would actually get to play that role someday. The other stroke of genius with The Passion of the Christ was using dialogue in the Aramaic and Latin languages, to lend a huge dose of realism to this film. Finally, we get to hear the words of Christ and his disciples in the language they spoke!This film has great, Oscar-worthy performances by Caviezel, by the woman who played his mother, and by the actor who played Pontius Pilate, and I hope they receive that recognition come Oscar time. The visuals in the film were excellent and the film moved along, growing in intensity with each scene. Gibson is a masterful storyteller and visual artist, and I also hope he receives a nod for Best Director by the Academy.The downside of the film for me is the violence. I do understand Gibson's intention was to show us the amount of suffering Christ endured for the sin of humanity and that it is our duty to endure the pain of watching such brutal violence he endured, but I thought it went on too long, with too much intensity. The violence surpasses Saving Private Ryan and was almost too much for me to handle. I was pleased that Gibson offered brief respites of the violence with flashbacks from key scenes in Jesus' life...the most tear inducing for me being the little boy who fell and was comforted by his mother. My favorite scene in the whole movie was seeing Jesus laughing as he talked to his mother about a table he was making. I wished there were more of that...in fact, I would almost beg Gibson to make this film the middle in a trilogy...with the same actors, one covering The Life of the Christ and the other covering The Resurrection of the Christ. In fact, the film is so brief in the resurrection scene, that I felt awful leaving the theater. There was no uplifting final scene to carry with you when you left the theater. I guess the point was to make us feel awful and guilty and hopefully get movie goers to head straight to church to confess their sins and renew their commitment to Jesus once again.Which brings me to my final point. This film has been seen as the best evangelical missionary tool to come along in ages. Many people seem to think that you could show a film like this to a non-Christian and they would be so guilt-ridden that they'd instantly convert to Christianity. If only if it were that simple. For me personally, a Christian all my life who leans towards Buddhism, I find the story of making Jesus out to be a sacrifice to appease an angry God to be simple, illogical, and insulting to anyone who believes in an all-knowing God. Portraying Jesus as a mere sacrifice who endured suffering for the sake of humanity does have metaphorical implications, but such violence is more likely to turn off people who shun violence, like many Buddhists are. But that's my only major complaint about the film. It doesn't detract overall from the high quality standards of this film nor its importance.

Not the scriptures, not an epiphany; a movie. And to that end, remember to view it as a movie; try not to let your emotions or faith overrule your logic, if that make sense.I gave this four stars for its relative adherence to the Bible; sure, there were some discrepancies; there always are in films of this nature. But basically, it stuck to the story. The cinematography was excellent. Some of the symbolism (Satan, the raindrop/tear) was kind of heavy-handed, and the acting, for what it was, ranged from competent to very good.

But that's just all opinion.And that's what Passion comes down to for all of us. Whether or not it supports your faith, gives you religion, etc., is, again, a personal thing. But as a film (and it is a film, remember) my feeling is that even though we know Jesus suffered horribly, the blow-by-blow Gibson offered was kind of over the top; that much graphic in-your-face violence I think, proved almost counter-productive to the point he was trying to emphasize; there's a thin line there that's easy to cross, and he stepped over it more than once. The idea of unrelenting pain can be conveyed far more deeply, I think, by image and suggestion rather than image alone. True, the violence in Passion was far purer that that in, say, Kill Bill or Lethal Weapon, in terms of its representation, but raw violence is still raw violence. And one needs to know its limits. I'm not a squeamish person by any means; I've seen lots of gorefest flicks. But when I saw Passion, there was a point when I wanted to jump up and say Enough!! We get the point, OK??And for all those who say That's what it was like! He's showing it as it happened! The film is historically accurate They're all incredibly pretentious statements. The fact is, neither you or anyone else -- INCLUDING all the experts who attest that the film was accurate-- knows exactly what it was like unless they were there. You have to accept that; it'snot a matter of faith but fact. NOBODY knows for sure.Anti-Semetic? Please. First off, not all Jews came off badly; only those under Caiphas' influence. It's like saying all Americans are racists because some of them belong to the Klan.Second, if anyone came off as really nasty here, it was the Romans. They were -- those soldiers in Judea, that is -- portrayed as completely sadistic almost throughout.Bottom line: watch Passion for whatever reason you wish. If it strengthens your faith, that's great. But push that start button understanding that you're seeing a movie depicting historical events, not history itself.OH... as far as this DVD having no special features... in a year, will anyone care about directors' commentary or how they did something?",4,"Ultimately, you have to make up your own mind...",1093910400,"08 31, 2004",0.1217
674,A33TBHM3O9AY17,310263662,No one of consequence,"[7, 9]","It has taken me about three months to work up the nerve to go see this movie. It opened in theaters back in February, but I didn't watch it until just this weekend. I had heard all the press coverage about just how horrible and graphic the scenes of Jesus' torture and crucifixion were, and felt more than a little uneasy about the thought of viewing it myself. I was expecting the absolute worst, so to some extent I guess it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Still, there has never been (nor likely again will be) such a realistic and gut-twisting depiction of our Lord's sufferings on behalf of fallen men.As a committed follower of Jesus, I found the entire story to be both familiar in one sense, i.e., I know the gospel accounts of Jesus' trial and execution, while in another sense it provided new and fresh insights into events that I previously could only visualize in my imagination. This additional dimension to the story can only add to my (and every other true believer's) level of love and worship for Jesus and what he did for me. When I was at church yesterday, I was immediately enthralled during the worship time as images from this movie were firmly fixed in my mind.I would urge every Christian to view this film soberly and with a great deal of reflection on just what an awful price was required to pay the penalty for our sins. And bear in mind that the physical torture paled in comparison to the horrific spiritual punishment that God the Father heaped on Jesus in that terrible moment of judgment. Only after the physical sacrifice was accompanied by the spiritual judgment of sin could Jesus say It is finished. If we take this to heart, we would not be nearly so complacent or cavalier in our attitudes toward our sin or obedience to the revealed will of God. What a wake-up call!My only criticisms are these: first, although by and large Jim Caviezel played his role marvelously, there were several scenes where he simply gave in to melodrama. In my mind this diminished the overall impact of the film. Second, I was troubled by Mel Gibson's injection of certain details that are not recorded in scripture, but are merely matters of Catholic tradition -- for example, the towel with the bloody imprint of Jesus' face. My problem with this isn't that I'm a protestant, it's that when Mel Gibson does such things he departs from the scriptural account and takes license that I believe is unjustified in portraying this event. The bulk of the film is quite true to the biblical record, and I just wish Mel had kept it that way for the whole.My final critique, and probably the most important, is that I would have liked to have seen this story set in the context of a fuller presentation of the gospel account, rather than limit the surrounding narrative to a series of limited flashbacks. A person who approaches this film without a certain familiarity with the gospels will have a hard time piecing together just why Jesus had to suffer and die as he did, and just what his death accomplished. The most striking illustration of the need for broader context is the scene where Mary Magdalene is saved from stoning. Not a word is spoken in that scene, and thus it is unlikely that someone who hasn't read John chapter 8 would understand what is going on in this scene.Overall, I think Mel Gibson did a wonderful job in telling this story, insofar as he chose to portray it. Notwithstanding all the controversy, the rejection by the Hollywood establishment, and the cries of antisemitism, I have no doubt that this movie is destined to be one of the all-time greats. The marketplace has already vindicated Mel Gibson, and I trust that the Lord will use this film for the advancement of his kingdom.",4,A reality check for complacent Christians.,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",-0.1178
675,A341BG8RMH8QW,310263662,NotATameLion,"[7, 22]","I wanted to like The Passion of the Christ. I can honestly say that I went to the movie with an open and favorable mind. I believe this is a movie that God will use to build His kingdom, but it is also fundamentally flawed.I have to say that this movie never really did its job in suspending my disbelief (as a member of the audience that is-not as a Christ-follower). Except for moments here and there I never got past the feeling of watching actors playing roles in a film.Perhaps this was because the movie does not tell the real story of the gospels. Perhaps the false and sometimes corny nature of the poetic license distracted me. Perhaps the movie just isn't that well done. I don't know what kept me from getting into the world of this movie.But I do know this...I was disturbed by this movie in two big ways.First, I was disturbed yet again by the unbelievable grace of God through his Son Jesus Christ. It never fails to rattle me to my core no matter how it is presented. This movie gives the most clear picture yet of what Jesus suffered in his final hours-though this movie is still a little soft-core in presenting a standard Roman state execution.The second way this movie disturbed me is the reason why I feel I have to throw my two-cents worth the discussion on this film. This film, while containing a skeleton that resembles the true Gospel, fails greatly in its faithfulness not only to the letter of its text, but its spirit.I can bear a gospel story that uses some poetic license. But the pieces which are interjected into this film are not only unnecessary and bizarre, they are theologically divisive and, in places, doctrinally inexcusable.The constant appearances by an androgynous and sinister looking Satan are a case in point. While I feel the initial temptation scene might even have had its place, echoing as it does the temptation of Eve and the first Adam in Eden, the rest of his appearances are foolishly used-being both Biblically unfaithful (after all, the real Satan masquerades as an Angel of light, not some bald weirdo in black) and a distraction from the focus on Christ's gift to us.The license with the story of Judas and the story of the Bad Thief are even more bizarre. The pecking out of the thief's eyes is not only poor license but bad theology. Here we have Jesus next to him praying for God to forgive everyone because they don't know what they are doing, and then whoosh... down flies Mr. Raven in what can only be seen as an act of (divine?) vengeance.The worst theology is regrettably that which is related to how Jews are depicted. Throughout the pre-publicity flap about this movie I refused to believe the charges of anti-Semitism. I still don't want to bandy such a term about loosely. Yet there are things in this movie that need explaining.I do not believe the Bible is anti-Semitic. I believe it to be God's holy and perfect word. My problem is not with any of the words from the Bible. My problem is with depictions of individuals, and of crowds.It is a problem when Pilate is made to look like a reluctant, would-be nice guy and Caiaphas is made to look like a want-to-be executioner. In the Biblical text, both act with expediency rather than out and out desire. Caiaphas does so actively, Pilate passively. Yet both find their vested interests of greater value than human life-an indictment that covers the entire world which they as Gentile and Jew represent.Christ was willingly crucified by the whole world in order to fulfill God's will that all might be saved. In the movie it is not so. The blame wrongly finds its way to the feet of Caiaphas and to the feet of the Jews.Other little things, like the depiction of Herod and various such oddities trouble me as well.Yet in the end I believe that God can use even a movie as troubled as this for his purposes. However, I recommend other movies, such as The Miracle Maker much more highly.",2,"whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached...",1078099200,"03 1, 2004",0.0342

On the other hand, the story of Christ is a powerful enough story that people of other faiths or even no faith can still understand and appreciate.The film seems to be about the glorification of pain and suffering; there is scene after scene of brutality. Jesus is arrested early on after his disciples battle the Jewish police. From there on, the story is dedicated to showing the slappings, punchings, whippings, flayings, scourgings, bludgeonings, nailings, and piercings he endured in the last hours of his life. We have some flashbacks woven in as Jesus reflects, and only there do we see him teaching his disciples, impressing his philosophy on them so they may carry it on. Ironically, these sometimes even manage to sidetrack the film because the overall pace is so geared toward the beating. James Caviezel is depicted like a piece of flayed meat for a good portion of the film. You'd think that a bit more on the impressive philosophy Christ spoke would make people understand his sacrifice better, but here it's like a footnote to the torture. If someone who has never heard of Christ or Christianity walks into this movie, what would it tell them?I think you have to be careful when watching a movie like this. It helps to put the production into context since Bible-based films are so rare these days. The film is a telling statement by Mel Gibson, one of the few people out there with the clout and the cash to pull something like this off and have it open on thousands of screens. Apparently he needs to continuously and literally hammer home his point: that Jesus died for our sins and endured tremendous, bone-crunching torture.I don't think all Christians focus on the actual details of the torture--particularly the scourging--as the main point of the faith. Gibson sure does, though. I have no problem with film violence. But it's the fact that Gibson feels the only way to really get his point across is to beat it into his audience that puts this film in murky waters. He doesn't want people to walk out feeling hopeful or more confidenct about their faith.Jesus takes a tremendous amount of punishment, but then again, so has Mel Gibson in most of his movies. It's being mentioned because it's an interesting point. A normal man would be dead after any of the beatings he takes in any of the Lethal Weapon movies. He is, of course, the same star-director who subjected himself to torture by the English in Braveheart. He made a film where he had half a face. He's made films where people are out to get him, kidnap his kids, and ruin his way of life. And now he's made a movie about the persecution of Christ. Has his whole career been heading toward this? Some kind of messianic message of some sort by an incredibly powerful Hollywood figure?The production is good, the camerawork is excellent; Gibson is a more than capable director. I don't know if James Caviezel is acting so much as enduring.It's a movie that is going to come up in many conversations, so see it and be informed. Plenty of people will talk about it but won't go and see it. Avoid that pitfall and go judge for yourself, unless you prefer others to do the thinking for you.The one thing that is very interesting and disturbing is that people are taking kids to see this movie. It's not a movie for kids, regardless of the subject matter. You wouldn't take a young kid to see Hellraiser, but to take him to see an incredibly gory film like this because you think it may instill or reinforce faith in God is morally dubious. It's almost like 'Scared Faithful'.

The crowds who gathered to watch feed off each other and are filled with people who want blood. Connections are made with some sympathizers and I felt their empathy and their horror and fear. Even at the end when Jesus is on the cross and his tormentors still do not relent he delivers the line which moved me most of all. Jesus looks up towards the heavens and asks his Father to forgive these men for they know not what they do.

In one sequence a huge visible chunk of Jesus' chest is torn away by a clawed cat-o-nine tails to reveal his ribs underneath. By the end of the movie Jesus is virtually half a skeleton with most of his body tissue removed and bone chipped away. It is the first time many of us have seen these images outside of a Slayer album cover and Gibson has turned the tables on what we could conventionally conceive in our minds as the murder of Christ. Nowhere in cinema has this subject be treated with the absolutely truthfulness and respect that it deserved. The actual term for these proceedings (the last twelve hours of Christ) is called - Deicide (The act of killing a being of a divine nature; particularly, the putting to death of Jesus Christ). The Passion of the Christ in wholly and indisputably a hell of a cinematic challenge for a rendition of Decide as it has never been seen before. You will not be able to tear your eyes away from the screen. When you come out of the cinema it is probably best if you take a lie down somewhere and contemplate what you have just witnessed. You have NEVER seen anything like this before... nor will you want to again.The Passion of the Christ does not go into much detail about the life of Jesus or anything much biblical. In fact it is more akin to watching No Comment on Euro News (basically news reports with just video images) and letting you make up your own mind. For those of you who are not informed about what the life of Jesus was before he was crucified then you would do well to watch some early Hollywood production of the man's life (even though The Passion of the Christ is NOTHING like anything Hollywood has put out before). Jesus does say the odd line now and again but mostly this is a story about physical and mental suffering and there is no shortage of that as the film descends into depths that cinema has not treaded on before and where angles would fear to go. The film starts in the Garden of Olives following the Last Supper and Jesus' encounter with Satan (the only flaw in the film was Gibson's overuse of these pantomime type evil characters and their satanic servants, rendered needlessly in CGI and do not really fit this picture that much in the same way that Jar Jar Binks did fit well with Star Wars Episode1.). Judas Iscariot cuts a deal with the Pharisees, who then pick Jesus up, torture him and humiliate him, before sending Jesus to a Roman trial to face charges of blasphemy. There are many moments of absolute unflinching horror throughout the ordeal even before the first whip is unleashed, however these are cleanly swept aside by the little miracles that occur along the way but it would only spoil it for you to tell you what these are (a scene involving the cross being turned over is one of the most startling shots ever committed to celluloid and is sure to raise a few hairs). These little miracle moments are extremely powerful and are captured wonderfully by the glorious cinematography (The Passion of the Christ looks simply divine).All in all it is hard to call this film a movie or an art-film. It is more akin to an `out of control' dramatic crime scene recreation that we see on true life law enforcement television programs, but here it is all uncut and does not shy away from exposing us to unrestrained, raw and unlimited amounts of human hatred and aggression. Forget the whole Anti-Semitic lark that the media went on about. The film clearly explains that Jesus, the son of God, was God, and chose his own fate. The fact that Jews or Roman's where involved is only incidental to them being there. They are the same as anyone else who could not see with open eyes! In fact under all the blood, bruises, bone and bumps Gibson manages to leave Christ's right eye intact. He highlights this eye at times with a subtle illumination that carries an `all seeing' message with it and is another strong imagery device that is used in this production. It is the little things like this that make the film ingenious in a `clever' Spielberg sort of way. However when all is said and done Martin Scorsese' The Last Temptation of Christ can still hold its own against this offering, however this one is certainly eons more disturbing.This is not a film you will enjoy but you will be damn glad that you went to see it and certainly since the original Matrix there has not been a good soul shaker doing the rounds in a long time.

That's not only false but absurd, and taken to extremes, utterly ridiculous. Unfortunately, that doesn't stop Mr. Gibson: his Christ goes through such outlandish beatings -one more preposterous than the last- that any skeptical viewer ends up laughing well before Our Lord gets nailed to the cross. Is this Jesus Christ we're talking about, or is it John McClane?No, seriously: early in the movie, even before he's taken to the Sanhedrin, Jesus is thrown off a bridge while tied to a rope (a torture not recorded in any Scripture but Mel's). Inches from the ground the fall stops in what surely looks like a paraplegic lesion at its very least. Any human body subjected to such injury would be unable to stand up or walk, let alone sustain a flogging, or carry a heavy burden. But this Jesus takes that and more. Hell, if Martin Riggs can take it, why not God? That's why He gave his Only Son such chiseled Caviezel abs!And what's with the demonic fellow, by the way? Why must there be a physical bad guy in the movie to incarnate Evil? Isn't all that violence enough? Satan is such an obvious clich&eacute;, audiences can anticipate his every move. For instance, having betrayed Jesus, Judas is on his way to hang himself when he sees a woman carrying a veiled child. Just as the baby's head starts to turn, we already know he's going to be a ghoulish sight. Sillier still: at the very moment Christ expires, the Devil shouts in agony NOOOOOO..! and disappears, just like a vampire on a stake would. A choir of angels singing Ding, Dong, the Demon's Dead! should follow.Superman vs. Goblins. Come on; is this the extent of Mr, Gibson's faith? Let's hope not.

Every frame is a work of art...I was moved to tears, much more than once. During the crucifixion, I turn to my sides & I see the people beside me crying as much as I was. When the lights dimmed back, after the movie ended, there was COMPLETE silence: not even a cough. The audience, & myself, were struck so deep by the movie. We all just sat there for a while, starring at the screen...amazed by everything...still soaking it all in. It was unbelievable.As for the Satan parts, I thought they were just another thing Mel Gibson added to separate his Jesus movie from the others. I say this in a GOOD way. No other Jesus movie showed the hands get nailed into the cross. No other Jesus movie showed the beatings & the blood that was spilt for everyone. No other Jesus movie showed Satan drive Judas to his death, tempt Jesus, or to basically tell the Roman's to beat Jesus until there was almost no flesh remaining. It's just one more thing to make it a differnt style of painting, of the exact same picture.As for the blaming the Jews for Jesus death part...there is no blame! This movie was not made to play a blame game. If you are going to see the movie to try to find anti-Semitic parts in the film: don't waste your time & money! I'd rather have a person sit beside me in the theater who is there to be moved by the death of Jesus Christ than to try to find things wrong with a Mel Gibson movie.The violence in the movie was there for a reason. How can you show a movie about Jesus being beaten & crucified without showing the true gore of it all? All the past Jesus movies showed 5% of the gore shown in The Passion & no other Jesus movie has moved audiences, & myself, as much as this movie has! Jesus was not just beaten for a while & put up on a cross...he was beaten brutally with sharp weapons, his hands were nailed to a cross, & he died a long, painful death. No other movie than this has bothered to go into such detail. The violence is truly what stays with you; it is burned into your mind after you've seen it. You no longer think lightly of the death of Christ.At the beginning of the movie I saw Jim Caviezel, I remembered a man I've seen from Frequency & The Count Of Monte Cristo. By the end of the film...I saw Jesus, I felt as though I saw Jesus die before my eyes. The acting is so Oscar-worthy in every way! This movie is not made to offend anyone, or to blame anyone for the death of Christ. It is to depict the awful, gruesome death of Christ & the message he gave the world before he left: love one another. BOTTOM LINE: anyone who can take the violence of the film should see it.

Randall,"[6, 9]","John 3:16: For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have eternal life.For many years, I knew of that passage in the bible and even superficially understand what it meant. It wasn't until I saw the movie, The Passion that I truly felt and internally understood what verse signified. Now, I will never forget its meaning. There has never been a more graphic and vivid visualization of the God love for humankind by sacrificing his only son so that we should have see Heaven. Director Mel Gibson's powerful and striking work of devotion is one of the most remarkable and memorable motion pictures I have ever seen. In telling the story of the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus Christ, Gibson crafts an epic that is both brutal and touching. No on who sees this movie will be same after watching it.Any film that attempts to tackle such a sensitive issue as the suffering (also known as `passion') and crucifixion of the Son of God is bound to stir up tremendous controversy. Mel Gibson certainly did that with his decision to tell the story of The Passion of the Christ. The Passion was slammed in Jewish circles for being anti-Semitic and slammed in many other circles for being overly violent. The outcry was so great that Gibson was forced to distribute this film on his own because no major studio would touch it. The controversy, itself, is mostly without justification. The fears of the film being anti-Semitic are unfounded. The movie does not condemn Jewish people for the actions of a few of their priests (Caiphas, most notably) in the death of Christ anymore than it condemns the Roman people for Pontius Pilate's weak and indecisive role in the crucifixion. It's the priests are to be condemned for their petty fearfulness. The Jewish people are shown to be quite sorrowful over the torture and death of Christ. The story, itself, is core to the origins of Catholic and Christian faith. Its existence is canon. Only misinterpretations in telling the story can cause ill will. The Passion is derived almost completely from the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Thus, it avoids that mistake.The criticisms pertaining to the overt violence of the film, while not baseless, are overstated. There is no doubt that The Passion is an extremely violent film and certainly not suitable for young children or faint of heart. However, there is nothing gratuitous or sensational about the violence. The scene of the scourging of Christ is one of the most difficult to sit through, but it is honest in its depiction of the brutality of the centurions of the Roman Empire. The graphic violence, torture and beatings are necessary so that the audience can truly empathize (and even sympathize) with the suffering Christ went through for our sins.Controversy notwithstanding, The Passion is amazing in its story structure and imagery. While primarily telling of the last twelve hours (events known to Christians the Stations of the Cross and a time known as Good Friday), Gibson uses small visual cues to segue into flashbacks of Jesus' life, thereby increasing the impact of the crucifixion by increasing the understanding of the greatness of this man. Such events as the Last Supper, the drawing of the line in the sand to protect Mary Magdelene, and the famous Sermon on the Mount are shown with such touching detail that audience feels deeply for this man. Even chorological events like Judas' betrayal of Jesus and Peter's denial of Jesus three times are emotionally gripping.While the scourging may be the most brutal aspect of the film, the events after Christ is put on the cross at Calvary are the most heart-wrenching. Actor Jim Caviezel does a spectacular job of embracing Christ's suffering while still showing his goodness and caring for others. When Jesus speaks to the good thief, one can feel overwhelmed. The other performances in this film are equally as stunning as Caviezel's. Maia Morgenstern captures the grief a mother feels as Mary watches her only son be put to death. The luminous Monica Bellucci also shows tremendous emotion as Magdelene, a woman who owes her life to the benevolence of Christ, yet is powerless to help him. Even Bulgarian actor Hristo Shopov effectively captures the conflict and indecision of Pilate.The Passion of The Christ is as astounding a cinematic achievement as has ever been brought to the big screen. It has been over a month since I saw it and it still dominates my thoughts. I said that no one who sees this film will ever been same afterwards.

When you ask yourself who is the true auteur? of a film, you can argue about the director, screenwriter, producer, cinematographer. Gibson gets a hat-trick (he didn't shoot the picture, but I'll bet he framed a something in every scene) and, as producer, hired the brilliant Caleb Deschanel to do the shoot. (I particularly appreciate Deschanel's visual quotations from art history -- Caravaggio's chiaroscuro lighting, Gr&uuml;newald's stark brutalism, Bosch's nightmarishly learning faces, and more.) This is a very bold, very imaginative, very powerfully realized conception of the passion of Jesus. If you think Gibson is less than just a pretty face -- and and I am NOT a fan of his movie performances -- you are, in my estimation, dead wrong. He's an impressive filmmaker.This is also a very Catholic film, and a very Isenheim Altarpiece perspective on Catholic belief, which is: you cannot walk away from the power of the suffering servant's sacrifice that the Church teaches and depicts in the crucifix, which dominates the nave of every Catholic sanctuary. One of Gibson's goals was to remind viewers that the term excruciating comes from crucifixion. Reviewers who have discussed The Passion's lack of affective power strike me as missing a sizable point: the Passion of Mary -- with Jesus's mother movingly portrayed by a Romanian Jew, Maia Morgenstern -- stays near the center of the narrative, as the Catholic Church's Mariology is near the center of its theology. In the crowded theater in which I viewed this picture, mothers, and particularly mothers with sons -- my wife included -- were shattered by some of the scenes of Mary's agony along the Via Dolorosa.I am neither Catholic, nor even Christian, nor am I Jewish. I don't have a religious stake in the anti-Semitism discussion. But I do in fact object to the portrait, on the screen, of the Jews and the Sanhedrin. I don't think Gibson's creation is intentionally anti-Semitic. I do believe, emphatically, that Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin are Jewish caricatures, who all look and sound like Tevye the Milkman, replete with guttural growls, who are attired, probably historically, in pompous ceremonial garb and, riding in slow caravan procession, astride their ridiculously tiny donkeys, noses in the air, bobbing up the road to Golgotha.This would be unobjectionable -- shouldn't we cast actors who will be believable as first-century Jews? -- if Jim Caviezel's Jesus, also a Jew, were not, before being pummeled into utter disfigurement, a sparkle-smiled, ripped fashion-model Messiah with a classically chiseled GQ profile -- his trainer gets a nice end-credit. And when the earthquake comes and the Temple is rent in twain and the Jewish leaders, now believing their actions have displeased the Lord, are thrown into confusion, we are to believe, as the New Testament accounts would also have us believe, that the Jesus's persecutors are reaping their just deserts. (And I do worry about the incendiary potential of this picture, but that's backstory material that I won't go into is a discussion of the film's merits.)Finally, it is very, very violent. Pornographic? No. The times were cruel, and the Romans didn't conquer and preserve an empire by waiting for an invitation or holding pinky-in-the-air tea parties. We go to movies to be taken to places we can no longer get to except through acts of imagination: 1st century Palestine is one such place. Attitudes toward cruelty have changed dramatically even in the last century -- many who read this will remember corporal punishment in elementary school, or routine unkindnesses that were heaped upon the bearer of any difference (facial features, disfigurements, handicaps, mental problems, etc.). We tend now to wince in the face of the terrible -- a learned reaction, bred into us by civilization. This movie places the terrible directly in your face.See The Passion and judge for yourself. Trust no opinion. For me, although this is the most familiar story in the world, it is nevertheless compelling as film, and, although some critics have said this is only for true believers, I would agree if we qualified that to mean: true believers in the power of film to transport, to stir, to confront, to anger, to inspire, to disturb.

It's my firm belief that Jesus doesn't want us to watch him get brutally murdered, he wants us to see a movie that talks about what he teaches and how it's important.I believe in God and Jesus, but I don't want to watch my savior get tortured for two hours. And for parents who bring their kids to see this movie . . . go to hell. This is not a kid's movie. It isn't that important that you should freak the crap out of your kids. I've seen kids that have seen this movie and it disturbs them greatly, as well as it should. One of the worst cases is of this crazy couple that took their autistic kid to see the 'Passion' and now that kid thinks that he's going to go to Hell. So, take that into consideration, it's R for a reason.So, remember, this is not the most important film ever made, because films are never important. It isn't fun and movies were made to be fun. That is the point. And another thing do not buy the 'Passion' merchandise. People should not be able to merchandise Jesus like this.

People come up with the most ridiculous bones to pick with this movie; it's porno violence, it's sexist because Satan is portrayed as a woman(actually much more of an androgynous figure, so ignore this moronic quibble when you see it), it's unfocused. The real problem for many of these critics is that it's a blockbuster movie about Jesus Christ and that's just not a valid subject for serious cinema. Anti Semitic? Absolutely not; if anything the film portrays Judas and Peter as the biggest jerks in the story, and people aren't so stupid as to become racists and bigots from viewing a Hollywood picture, thank you very much. Overly violent? It's a film about THE LAST TWELVE HOURS OF CHRIST'S LIFE! What do you think you're going to get? If graphic violence is gritty, hip or brilliant in a Tarantino movie it's just as valid here for my money. Mel Gibson deserves a lot of respect for his guts and vision in putting his own money where his mouth is in order to maintain the artistic integrity of his project. This isn't Bad Boys, Charlie's Angels or Dirty Dancing here folks, and we should be grateful that there is a filmmaker in Hollywood who still produces work of this caliber.Okay, now that I've vented, the acting is top notch, from the brilliant Jim Caviezel through the sadistic Roman soldiers, the photography is lush, the score is great, and it passes the real litmus test: you absolutely will not find your thoughts drifting to your grocery shopping, laundry, annoying co-workers, or anything else while viewing this film.

Lunde,"[12, 27]","I waited a while to see The Passion of the Christ so that I could approach it fairly and without the shouting of the faithfull/unfaithfull clogging up my ears. Recently, I was amazed to read Roger Ebert's 4-star review, which stated it was a great film simply because Ebert believed in what he was seeing and the film depicted that. So, I got it, saw it, and, . . .not so fast Mr. Ebert.Let me take this thing apart from several angles. For production, the film was nicely shot and adequate, and overall, the shots of Jerusalem type surroundings were effective. But the entire film was very cramped, and the only drammatic sequences that worked well for me were the scenes with Pontious Pilate. The film uses a broad brush of color and myst; this reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings, and I half expected Frodo and Golom to appear at any time. Its constant use of slow motion to accentuate the beatings and whippings was very distracting, and the usual heavenly music competed with memories of The Ten Commandments. From these perspectives, Jerusalem in the Kingdom of Heaven was a powerful and beautiful film, which also gave the city a memorable singularity and grace. I also rewatched Barrabas, an earlier epic that more creatively and poignantly tells and shows this story, and at least, with more interest.As Jesus, James Caviezel has a handsome and photogenic face; kind of a Charlton Heston replacement with chiseled, monumental features. (He was marvelous in The Thin Red Line.) He looks like those Jesus pictures that people expect to see in a minister's office. In this film, however, Caviezel is constantly looking either very focused and silent or very confused and silent. He says little, but apparently this means a lot. When he gets whipped and beaten, which is often, it hurts, and he shows it, as most of us would. When I sum up the character in total, however, I am left with a rather empty shell of a portrayal. For those who know this story, explanations aren't necessary, and this is all Gibson gives the viewer. All the other characters, including the Romans, fall into stereotypical grieving, brave Mary, hysterically grinning, laughing, and ponderoulsly cruel Romans, cunning and slithering Jewish prelates, mournfully sad looking apostles, and a devil who looks suspiciously like Marilyn Manson (with snakes). Only Judas and Pontious Pilate have particlular roles that intrigue and question, but Gibson is too in love with the blood of Jesus and the leering of others to let them have much screen time. I wasn't left with any conviction that these people were real or that the event was any more worthy than the millions murdered over the millenia.The script was written for the faithful. What does this mean? If you go into most medieval churches in Europe, you sill see the renditions of the Christ story by the great painting masters of their time; you see the suffering of Christ, the crucifiction of Christ, Christ carrying the cross, the Resurrection of Christ, and so on. This film is merely a modern extension of those themes, and nothing else. I wanted to come away from this film with a new feeling, an insight into this story, which is entirely based on belief and with no archeology or record to support it. Pasolini's St. Matthew film portrays a believable Jesus, Barrabas gives us an intellectual and epic story of a man's journey to belief, and even M. Scorcese's film asks questions about the life of Jesus. None of this is in this film, just blood, more blood, flayed flesh, and more blood.

Because of the subject matter people have taken it so sincerely they have even created a Passion of the Christ Gospel. It is sad that people dwell so intensely on the death of a man whose life stood for love and peace. Jesus did not want to die, but he knew that he had to in order to make a point for all of the murderous, unloving cretins that could not love themselves or others. The saddest part is that the same sort of people are still killing him over and over..and now you can see it on DVD! I don't recall reading any of this gore in the gospels albeit it is well known that the Romans were a blood thirsty culture.

He dedicated his life to serving God the Father and mankind by God's will. He was and is perfect.But we can never be. Never again, will another walk upon the earth who is sinless, blameless and perfect as Jesus is. Jesus Christ, God's one and only beloved son, given as a sacrifice to redeem mankind and save us from ourselves. God's ultimate love offering given because He loves us so. Jesus came for exactly this, that we may be saved, have a new life more abundant here and eternal life with Him in God's kingdom. Yes, he taught us and lived as the living example of what we all should aspire to be, but also to do what none of us could not do for ourselves. Pay the debt for our sins.Mel Gibson directs this powerful film that gives us the most accurate recreation of the Lord's passion and suffering that has ever been seen. Combining the descriptions in the New Testament's gospels along with the Old Testament's prophecies of the Lord and the historical depictions of Roman punishment and torture devices, we're able to see what the Lord most likely really endured. No question, this film is brutal, but it must be. If not, we only take away the truth in order to make ourselves feel more comfortable. I've seen many a violent film in my time but I found myself cringing more here than any of those. Not because I've never seen worse but because this is what the Savior did for us. It should've been us taking the beatings, the floggings and the crucifixion. That was our punishment placed upon the holy and innocent Son of God.'The Passion' focuses on the last days of Jesus' life here on earth. From the opening, we find him on the Mount of Olives, as the sins of the world are being placed upon him. As the cold, hard reality of the pain and suffering that he is about to endure for a people by large that reject him. But his love and dedication to The Father being so great, he remains committed and fulfills his purpose. He allows himself to be unjustly arrested and convicted of a crime he did not commit. Then handed over to the Romans to be scourged, tortured and ultimately put to death for the love of The Father and every one of us who's sins he bore. As it is written, greater love has no man that he who lay down his life for his friends.But all of this would be in vain and just be a sad story had he not risen from the grave. If He were He just a man with some crazy ideas. But He did rise and is Lord and friend to all His people, to all God's children, while extending His invitation to all those who would receive Him. But contrary to popular belief, we are not all God's children. We are all God's creations but not until we are born again by grace through faith, confession and repentance in the Lord Jesus Christ, are we God's children. Jesus said, unless we are born again, we cannot see the kingdom of God, and I am the way, the truth and the life, no one comes to the Father but by me. And so it is. Our sins must be dealt with. And so they were, on the shoulders of the Lord when he died on the cross, shedding his precious blood for us.This movie brought people to question, who's to blame? Is it the Jews fault, or the Romans, or all of us? In a way, all three are true. We are all responsible. He paid the price for our sins, our debt. We all had a hand in it. But it was also the greatest demonstration of love ever shown. The Father's great love and the love of the Lord.Some complain that the film is too focused on the suffering and doesn't show the events leading up to this point, the miracles and the relationships. I understand that but theres only so much time to do it. There is a scene though, in a flashback, where Jesus is building a table and you see a playful sweetness between him and his mother Mary. It's touching and I wanted to see more of that but there are other films that give us more of His life. I recommend 'Jesus of Nazareth' in what I believe is the most compelling and accurate telling. But this film had to stay focused. It too had a mission and purpose. To bring us to face what God the Father and the Jesus Christ did for us. So we could face the reality of it and of ourselves and I believe it succeeds. Many peoples lives were changed with this movie. Many people came to believe and we're saved. Many saved had fallen away and recommitted their lives to the Lord. Others were inspired to reflect and give thanks for the wonderful gift given to us. I know I did. I loved the fact that it got people talking. It got people thinking and discussing. It was on the T.V. and in the papers. People who would never otherwise talk about Jesus were and many who would never go to see such a film did. It was a wonderful time and a credit to the film.The dvd gives us a lovely period looking picture. Lots of browns and muted colors to show the age and make it believable. The print is clean and virtually free of blemish. The audio and score are very good. The dialog is in ancient hebrew with subtitiles which gives it a serious realism and isn't distracting. A very satisfying disc.In closing, 'The Passion' is a wonderful film. It's an undenialble message that will force the viewer to take a stand on what they believe or don't believe. There is no middle ground. And that's a huge accomplishment for a film, to do what it did. Mel Gibson has become a very accomplished director and it all shows here. Many criticize him even to this day for comments he made while intoxicated. People have used it as a chance to bash him and this movie. But as Jesus said, let he who is without sin, cast the first stone. We've all said and done things that weren't right and have no right to rake another over the coals for it. He's human after all, just like the rest of us and just as we wish to be forgiven for our own sins, we should forgive him. He made a wonderful film that I suggest anyone and everyone watch with the exception of small children as there is alot of blood and violence that'll no doubt be scary to them. Parents, please use discretion and view it first. Jesus offers his invitation for salvation to everyone from all cultures and beliefs. All are welcome and no one will be turned away.

Was his last days as, in today's lexicon, a hybrid Diety-Human more of an exhibition, even to the extent of asking his Father, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?. As God's Son, would he have the Power to miraculously avoid the suffering? A big question for this Reviewer.To the actual film: I think it would have worked better as a Play, even a Ballet. Has a very, staged, mechanical look to it. If Gibson really did reference Anne Emerich's writing (and possibly his own Father's insensitive comments about Jews today), then perhaps he was trying to teach or at least share with Christians *and* Jews, his personal take, albeit awkward, on the events of two thousand years ago.Tough Love perhaps? The bludgeoning of the viewers senses with continuous corporeal beating of the man who represented Peace?But good intentions cannot surmount biased historical perspective: I submit that there were enough Jewish-Christians in the supposed angry masses to suppress the desires of a small minority who didn't understand the situation as a whole and *and* their own Peaceful tradition.Mel, The Year Of Living Dangerously, Lethal Weapon(s), and Braveheart are your celluloid domain.

One is awe-struck by the dignity of the Lord in the face of such savagery. Caviezel's performance is nothing short of miraculous. Yes - the brutality is raw, vivid, but necessary. To soft-pedal the passion is to lessen His sacrifice and minimize the reason for His suffering. WE are the reason for this suffering.

Here are the most important reasons...Firstly, I read somewhere about a saint (could be the Fatima Saint Lucia Santos) saying that Christ was upset over the fact that no one on Earth reads his passion and death in the Gospels anymore--or atleast the majority of people on Earth don't pay great deal of attention to it. So I kind of believe that Jesus had a hand in making this film--no matter if Mel Gibson knew about it or not.Secondly, I think I've read somewhere that Mel Gibson thought depressing thoughts during the time that he was making Braveheart (or atleast before or after that time), and that the only thing that got him through life was reading the passion of Jesus.Thirdly, there is supposed to be a town in Germany that, during the middle ages, was almost on the verge of contracting the plague, but the residents of this town decided to ask God to not allow the plague to come to them if they decided to put on the play of his son's passion and death from then onwards. I think they are still putting on this play to this day, and the plague never came to their town.This movie is great. It had everything that I expected from a clean cut movie depicting the brutality that the enemies of Christ inflicted upon Christ himself. It shows how much Christ loved the Universe by sacrificing himself for all of us. This movie shows a perfect dignity and respect to Jesus and his Apostles, unlike the perfomances shown in the movie: Jesus of Nazareth--although this last movie made in the late '70s is not so bad either.

I also wanted to support Mel Gibson who raised his own 25 million dollars to make this movie because no one in Hollywood would dare back him up. No need to feel sorry for Mel though, because now this movie has made over 200 million dollars as I write this and is the #1 movie in America two weeks in a row.

When you see what Jesus went through in this film it just pulls at your heart and makes you appreciate what Jesus did for us all. This is a graphic movie but what would you expect from a crucifixion. One of the many touching moments of this film is when the drop of water from heaven falls when Jesus died I felt it was God the father crying for giving his son to cleanse us for all our sins.

After all, I thought depictions of graphic violence would help illustrate how horrible the crucifixion was. Unfortunately graphic violence alone isn't enough to give this movie the emotional impact that the subject deserves.The audience goes into this movie with knowledge of who and what Jesus is. For this reason Mel Gibson apparently thought that no character establishing scenes were necessary. All we learn from this movie is that Jesus was a guy who suffered a lot. In fact the ultra-violence actually made the crucifixion seem less agonizing to me. I couldn't help but think that after losing about 3 gallons of blood (based on the large pools left on the ground after he was flogged) and the beatings he took about the head, that Jesus would have been too far gone by the time he was nailed to the cross to feel much pain. The few, brief scenes which didn't involve Jesus' torture were mostly uninspired clips of events which occurred in the days prior to the crucifixion. These are scenes that those who have read the bible are all too familiar with, and the dull, monotone delivery by the actors does nothing to bring these scenes to life. The scenes of Satan and demonic children throughout the movie seem random and silly. How the writers and director could do so little with such a great story bewilders me.A far more moving movie is Jesus of Nazareth. The only objection I have heard about Jesus of Nazareth is that Jesus is played by a non-Jew with blue eyes. If you can't get over that then you will be depriving yourself of seeing a movie about Jesus that delivers far more insight into what a wise, charismatic, and loving entity Jesus was. Brilliant performances combined with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack make the crucifixion scenes in Jesus of Nazareth carry far more emotion impact than the passion of the Christ did.",1,no emotional impact despite graphic violence,1095984000,"09 24, 2004",-0.1273

It is a deeply moving and deeply horrifying depiction of the last 12 hours of Christ's life. I am not religious at all, not in any way, but i was touched by the sheer brutality of the movie. Skeptics who say this movie was only made to make money and shock people with its violence are wrong: the movie was made to show people the suffering of Christ. Too many people take it lightly, but it was a mind boggling, horrid event. I wont ruin the movie for people who are yet to see it, but lets say at one point you see Christ's INSIDES. It's brutally violent, and for the most part historically accurate. Remember people: this is Gibson's interpretation. No one can make a completely accurate movie about Christ's torment and execution because no filmaker was there to see it, so please don't write reviews describing every tiny detail that you may think should have been shown differently.

The movie (whether a documentary/not) is about the last 12 hours before the death of Jesus. Why he came in the first place (shown as flashbacks in the movie) and why he died (so we may be reconciled to God & have eternal life). It is very detailed in the suffering and humiliation he endures. (I'd be careful with having children younger than 15 see this movie)It starts with Jesus in the garden where he prays for God's help and mercy before he is betrayed by one of his disciples (who had been bribed by the priests at the time). He is handed over to the priests who question him and find him guilty for blasphemy from what he said about being the Son of God, this is after the false witnesses testimonies were found to contradict.He is taken to Pilate the Roman Governor of the time who finds no fault with him. For this reason he is tried before the king of his province, who also finds no fault in him. He is then returned to the Roman governor who orders that Jesus be crucified to please the people, so there is no uprising among them. The movie goes on to show every stage of his crucifixion in details. It ends with his resurrection.As for those concerned that the actor who plays Jesus is expressionless, well it's because that is what happened as recorded in the bible. Jesus never once tried to defend himself, he spoke very few words at his trials. And so it is in the movie. But even though there isn't a lot of talking, there is much loving in his eyes. For instance, he comforts his mother under so much pain and agony.For those uncomfortable with the movie for whatever reason, well you might want to ask why. This is not just for the sake of religion but it's about finding out why you are not comfortable and see what bothers you and try to find answers. One way is to go see the movie without any prejudice (christian or not). And find your own (correct) meaning to it.I think this is an awesome movie about love. Which isn't exactly the way Hollywood usually portrays it (love = sex). It is the story of one who loves enough to die for those he loves.

Upon seeing the film, Pope John Paul II said, It is as it was. Gibson's simple goal was to present the sufferings of Christ during the final few hours of his life...to note that it was not the Jews who killed Jesus, or even the Romans; it was all of us. The sacrificial, voluntary, selfless way in which Christ gave Himself to die in our place is portrayed brilliantly by James Caviezel. His acting is nothing short of a tour de force that should--like Gibson--be recognized when award season rolls around. The Aramaic and Hebrew languages add a ring of authenticity and poignancy to the film. Bold, daring, imaginative...this is like no film you have ever seen. Some have criticized the violent nature of the film--amazingly, these same critics seem to have little to say about the actual violent nature of Christ's death. So many advocates of free speech tried to supress this film before its release, using scurrilous and baseless claims designed to stir hysterical fear. However, with nearly $380 million in US box office receipts alone, this film proved that it was something special; it has struck a chord in viewers in a way that films such as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SCHINDLER'S LIST, and other noble classics have done in the past.

743,A2VXLLBBT7CL89,310263662,R. Bayerl Specialist in having fun,"[1, 10]","After hearing how so many folks in the evangelical Christian community have approved of this film, I went in with a great hope that I would experience some sort of epiphany; a renewal of the mind, in which I'd see things clearer about the hope of Christ in my otherwise tired life. So I took half a day off, the only way I can see an honest-to-goodness movie any more in this regimented life, and took my seat. It surely smacked of authenticity, as we see in the most compelling of ways how the King of the Jews was smacked around by the kind of sadistic folks that hold power in a dreary Roman backwater. In the more comical words of Will Smith as Jim West (Wild, Wild West), now THAT was a whuppin'.But the initial question posed by satan, which ran along the lines of how can one man's death remove the sins of all mankind?, remained without much of an improvement on the answer. I suppose I should have brought a little more faith with me to the theater. If you're into Scripture and like the infallibility of the Bible, well, this is a good one. The script is faithful to the Gospels, through and through. I was thinking that what we have here is the vision of canonical Christianity for 2004, just as we saw for 1959 with Ben Hur. But while a movie like this is fine raw material for the inspired, who have a better map of just where the pieces fit in the implied majesty of the makers of initial premise, it is not as directed to the wandering ones who are after a compelling reason for holding such premises in the first place. The choir needs the sermon, yes, but even more so the backsliders and the non-contrite.I don't know why I'm so down on such a fine and time-tested story. It could well be the cynicism of this day, in which faith is not so readily accepted at face value. I suspect that were I in a true state of grace, I'd be putting down the five stars. This must not be the year for that kind of stuff.I did sit in one sitting through the entire 126 minutes, for the pugilism of Roman and Jew alike, with every variety of contemporary weapon formed in those days, was sensational in itself. The character best portrayed is that of Pilate, who realizes he has a real problem on his hands. There are so many flashbacks to the high points of Christ's ministry, such as the Sermon on the Mount, the stoning of the adultress, the Last Supper, etc., only what we end up with is a crucified King. Are we simply being told to turn our other cheeks, the way Yeshua turns just about every part of his body to the scourgings? If I was supposed to have a personal experience of Jesus Christ as my Personal Savior through this film, well, I'll stick with the ones I had as a much younger man. The emphasis of the progressive ministry is, after all, a call for direct dialogue and personal experience, rather than being shown in imagery an interpretation that purports to be authentic. I suppose I'm seeing in a mirror what might one day be seen clearly, to borrow from Paul.Were we not so entirely inculcated in Western culture with the Passion narrative, I'm not thinking this would be such a compelling drama. Some upstart of the countryside has a cult following, he's picked up as a security threat to the government, and is beaten to a pulp, prior to his execution. It would be better with an international terrorist conspiracy, perhaps, one that fights with automatic weapons and grenade launchers. It seems strange, that the the leader of the good guys should get such treatment.To the film's credit in advocating the love of those that torment you, I found that I was better able to tolerate the horrendous city traffic getting home, when this was done. Still, during that same interval, I turned on the CD in the truck of Webber & Rice's Jesus Christ Superstar and felt a good bit more in the 60's version of the way it was, on that day, when he took my sins away.The crucifixion, indeed, is a riddle.

Doktor Goebbels commissioned a film the purpose of which would be to discredit Christianity. Let us further surmise that the result was a film called The Passion of the Christ. Given these results, the filmmaker would have been awarded German filmdom's highest award, the Adolf, plus a special thorn cluster authorized by Herr Doktor Goebbels. That was then.This is now. And here it is at last: a new technologically advanced edition of the world's slimiest Bible travesty in all its Gospel-bashing, anti-Semitic, and fantasy-pushing glory.Aside from its propagandistic purposes, Passion is so full of inaccuracies, it's hard to know where to start. Let's start by noting that the only historically worthwhile (if not necessarily accurate) narratives we have of the so-called passion are the 4 canonical gospels. Nothing else of a non-scholarly nature is worth the paper it's printed on. This film depends on apocryphal (and useless) narratives, the ravings of a 19th-Century hysteric nun, and other fraudulent sources. In addition there are other solecisms of a purely stupid nature.For instance, Gibson thinks he's really clever by having people speak the languages they would have spoken at the time. And then, laughably, he has Jesus and Pilate conversing in Latin. Latin was not the lingua franca of the Roman East ... that was Greek. Furthermore, Jesus was born (at Bethlehem-in-Galilee, not Bethlehem-in-Judea) and raised in Galilee, an area which was under the Hebrew- and Greek-speaking rule of various Herods. Jesus and Pilate would have spoken in Greek. (The argument that Jesus would have learned Latin from Roman soldiers is just silly ... Galilee was part of an autonomous kingdom and Roman soldiers didn't enter the area until after the exile of Herod Antipas in 39 CE. Besides, the Roman military spoke a patois of Italic - related to Latin - that was widely used in northern Italy.)Gibson's contempt for the canonical gospels is a main theme of the film. In Gethsemane, Jesus is shown not so much praying to his god but having a conversation with Satan - something the gospel writers seem totally unaware of. Later on, the soldiers that arrest Jesus throw him bodily from a bridge - an event utterly absent from the gospels.The events between Jesus' arrest and his crucifixion show not only Gibson's contempt for the gospels, but also his utter ignorance of the practices of Roman law and the evidence of archaeology. The bit covering his appearance before the Sanhedrin is hilarious. The charge - the only charge - was actually a term totally misused these days, blasphemy. That is, in the Greek, blasphemia, which means treason, in the sense that Jesus has claimed to be King of Judea. Despite pathetic attempts by Christians, from the First Century CE on, to give this term a religious connotation, it is a political crime, pure and simple. Gibson's failure to recognize this fact is stupid - as is everything else in this film.The scourging of Jesus is a good example of Gibson's contempt for facts. Roman judicial procedure is well known and the gospels in fact do a fair job of showing it correctly. Gibson's version is not only inaccurate, it's trashy. The pronouncing of sentence of crucifixion ends with this sentence: Let him be scourged. No person to be tried before a Roman court was whipped until that sentence was uttered.Furthermore, the whip shown in this film wasn't the one used in these cases - it was employed by Gibson solely for its shock value, not in any interest of accuracy. The actual whip (Latin: flagellum) consisted of several strands of leather of varying length, each tied to a small lead ball. If you believe the Shroud of Turin is any sort of genuine artifact, please note that it is that whip whose marks appear on the back of the individual portrayed in the shroud. This tool of punishment also appears in archaeological contexts.The number of strokes was limited to a those needed to start a flow of blood - the purpose of scourging being primarily to weaken the victim and shorten his/her time on the cross. They were delivered by a trained professional. What Gibson's film shows is not only ridiculously excessive but incomprehensibly and improbably brutal. This portrayal is clearly for salacious shock value and not any concern for truth. It is at this point (if not before) that the film degenerates into a work of pure fiction.There is, however, more degeneracy to come. In a scene that occurs nowhere in the gospels nor any other creditable source, Mary is wandering among the pools of blood in the courtyard in which Jesus was scourged. We'll forego questioning how she got past all those guards into a secure area of a Roman fortress. Then out trundles Mrs. Pilate with an armload of bedsheets or used togas or some such. She vanishes and Mary begins to mop up all the blood with togas or sheets or whatever. Say what? Is she collecting souvenirs? I can see a framed slice of sheet on a humble wall in Nazareth. There's a toga of actual blood! What ... you don't like the bit about the frame on the wall? That's just as disgusting and stupid as somebody mopping up blood in the first place. No wonder the gospels ignore the whole silly story in the first place. Not only is it silly, it's a fairy tale insulting to the intelligence of anyone whose cerebrum's weight exceeds 1 ounce.Ah, but wherefore Herr Dr. Goebbels' award of the prestigious thorn cluster? Well, of course: the film's stunning if subtle anti-Semitism. We could point to the film's zeal in promoting the old canard that the Jews forced a conviction on a Roman governor who in fact would just as soon crucify people as look at them.We can and do point to one of the film's most prominent characters - one who actually appears only once, in a brief sentence, in the gospels' passion narratives. This character is Satan, the so-called devil, who pops up everywhere in this film. This character is the most palpable, horrifying manifestation of the film's anti-Semitism. This manifestation takes the form of Satan being cast as a First Century Jew ... right down to the shawl over his head.This libelous identification of Judaism with Christianity's evil angel must of course give much schadenfreude to nutters like the Aryan Brotherhood, the American Nazi Party, and others who live only to hate. Gibson's depiction of Satan as an embodiment of Judaism - this nation's moral bedrock - is an act of the most desperate bigotry.Considering that Passion is a tissue of lies and misrepresentations, an affront to anyone who values and respects the gospels, and a virtual celluloid hate crime, we would expect Christians everywhere to shun it for the arrant nastiness that it is. But what do we find? They are busy declaring this shabby travesty a triumph of their faith. What does that say of them?

As a cinematic achievement, it is nothing short of brilliant: photography, music and, particularly, editing. Gibson's vision was sincere, and it has shone true, blindingly! Historically, one must remember that the Romans were in control of the area; they thought the Jewish patriarchs were a silly bunch of fanatics, and pretty much left them alone. So much so, that when threatened by Christ's ideology, one that would threaten the power they held over the majority, they had to eliminate the threat. Neither Pilate nor Herod wanted to be bothered, so they let the elders have their way. This is not an anti-Semitic depiction. Rather, the reigning majority found necessity in eliminating a threat to their very existance. This has happened throughout most recorded history. To call Gibson an anti-Semite is absurd. I found this to be historically accurate, without prejudice, and a brutal and honest display of those times (as well as we could imagine it). The Romans were portrayed as a bunch of mean drunks. Was Gibson anti-Roman? I give him credit for exposing his views in such a profound fashion. When I was a bartender, I learned that the two things you never discuss are religion and politics, because no two people will ever agree. Gibson took these two ever-present elements of the world society and shoved them in your face, fearlessly and without shame. I am amazed at his achievement, and applaud his artistry and his guts.

I read all the negative reviews (before I went) and thought I was in for some kind of documentary on crucifixion, or a gory movie filled with violence; but instead it was a riveting story, and the violence fit the movie theme perfectly (I think most reviews just don't get it, cause they don't believe in sin) this movie is about GOD's LOVE for us sinners; the violence Christ suffered serves the purpose of forgiving all our sins. Also I heard all the arguments about the movie being anti Semitic, but how could it be, Jesus, the Apostles (especially John who is featured throughout the movie), Marry Jesus' mother and Mary were all Jewish. The movies shows that only some priests wanted Jesus crucified and that they stirred up a mob to pressure pilot to put Christ to death, as the scriptures say. It in no way casts blame on all Jewish people and in fact if everyone would just read ISAIHA chapter 53 in the Jewish scriptures that would see that the Christ came to die for us. Also I heard an argument that it shows Jews as ugly and hooked nosed and this is pure BS, the ugliest person in the movie was the actor who played the apostle Peter. Really the Roman's look the worst in this movie; All the priest looked normal to me. The movie (all 2:06) went by fast. While I would not call this movie entertaining (it was in a way), because of the subject matter, it was emotionally gripping, and visually engrossing and I was completely transfixed by the movie. My mind did not wonder off (like usual at a movie), Not once. It garbed my attention from the first moment in the garden and kept it till the resurrection.

The whole torture scene was one of the most gruesome things in movie history that I've ever seen. I really do think that the violence is just there to show how brutal people were back then. During some violent scenes, such as the pounding of the nails and Jesus bearing the cross, they would switch to a flash back for an instant such as the last supper to ease some of the stress for the viewer so they don't take in the whole thing at once. One of my favorite parts was when Jesus is resurrected at the end, and as he gets up and walks by, you see the holes in his hands left by the nails. This movie really gave me a whole new perspective on life and how I take alot of things for grantit.

But now that I've finally seen it, I'm very glad I did. The film is excellent, the acting across the board is superb - Jim Caviezel's incredible portrayal of Jesus will forever be the definitive cinema Christ for me, the cinematography is also first rate, and the music is beautiful to listen to. The violence is tough to watch but it is not gratuitous. Jesus according to the Gospels did endure horrific brutality and Roman crucifixion was designed by the state to be a savage deterrent. Two scenes that stick with me are the playful loving tenderness between Jesus and Mary when Mary calls Jesus inside for mealtime while he is busy building a table, and the other is Simon of Cyrene screaming at the people and soldiers to stop beating Jesus as he was lying on the ground, then whispering to Jesus that they are almost there as he helped him carry his cross to Golgotha. That was a very powerful and moving scene, among many throughout the film.

It was the first time it has been shown in our country sponsored by a group of young christians who are ministering for the campus. It was supposed to be shown here before Holy Week but I have the chance to watch it first! I am so excited and eager to see this film for the very first time, I thought I will not be able to purchase a ticket which is so expensive but luckily I got one. I can't let go of this opportunity! The whole theatre was jampacked with hundreds of enthusiasts, excited, curious, religious, and even skeptics moviegoers. People from all walks of life were there to see for themselves why 'The Passion...' is really a 'passionate', 'brutally', 'movingly', and 'artistically' crafted by actor-producer-director Mel Gibson. If you were only there in the theatre for 1 to 2 hours, you can observe and see people watching quietly, with immense emotion and concentrating to the pace of the movie most especially to some scenes which is virtually 'a pain' in the eyes.Technically, the graphical presentation of the passion is really an extreme. I can't help but to close my eyes whenever the Roman soldiers would scourge the back of Jesus and blood spurting on their faces and flesh were torn apart by the blades and spikes of the lashes. The sound of the ripping flesh, striking lashes, unpleasant laughters and shouts of the soldiers and mobs were really audible. This film could make it as a long 'torturing' film about the passion of Christ of all the movies that were made about Christ! I would like to give a strong discretion for those minor viewers for intense graphic and visual effects because of 'bloodied' scenes. Parents ought to guide their children if they view this film.About the film, 'The Passion...' has presented the accuracy and historicity of the final 12 hours of Christ in some aspects which were recorded by the evangelists and bible historians. It was well-researched and consulted. The impressive thing here is the use of languages of latin and aramaic which considred to be dead languages. Thanks to the film producers that it has provided the sub-titles in English. The languages used were a plus factor for the uniqueness and authenticity of what it presents the subject. Though the languages spoken were unique, it is never a difficulty nor a factor for a viewer to follow the story but moreover, the viewer can really grasp the essentials of the dialogues. I lauded Mel Gibson for his direction of this film because I appreciate some of the symbolic gestures used in this film like when Simon of Cyrene was carrying the cross together with Christ , and with their both shoulders and arms embracing the cross...very meaningful! Gibson is fond of slow motion, and he really uses a lot of it to some scenes which are vulnerable like the scourging at the pillar, the crowning f thorns, the crucifixin, and many more! and the cameras are turning 360 degrees as for its special effects.Jim Caviezel delievered his role as Jesus was really impressive and outstanding...you can really moved by Jim's acting with such impressive performance. Other casts are great and performed well with such convincing portrayals.I don't believe that this film is anti-Semitic because one thing I can say is that the Jewish were also the victims here. We don't generalize things here because not all Jews during the time of Christ's crucifixion is not really representing all Jews in general. Jews were victims here because of the deception that the high priest and his council have done to Jesus. Jesus is a jew too, remember? he is also the victim here as part of the Jewish community. It's fair to say that not all Jewish were the people who put Jesus to death but only the misguided Jews who are deceived and blinded by the falsity made by the men who called themselves God's representative.So, if you want a long torturing film about the passion experienced by Christ...I recommend this film but you must hold on to your seats to fully bear the visual and graphic contents of this film.

Mel Gibson stepped up and delivered such a film in 2004 with The Passion of the Christ. Jesus of Nazareth remains my favorite film about the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. The Passion of the Christ is not about the LIFE and MINISTRY of Jesus, but about His death and the twelve hours leading up to His crucifixion. The story of a God who loved all mankind so much that He sent His only Son to die for our sins so we could be with Him for all eternity is indeed the greatest story ever told. Gibson, drawing from the four gospels of the New Testament, has given us a faithful, lovingly crafted rendering of that story. James Caviezel gives one of the greatest performance of any screen Jesus I've ever seen (second only, perhaps, to Robert Powell in Jesus of Nazareth). Yes, this film is very bloody, and is probably not suitable for children under thirteen. Yet many of the same media buffoons who have attacked The Passion for its violence have defended many other movies which are also very violent, but not nearly as uplifting as The Passion. Now, nearly three years after the releaseof the original theatrical cut of the film, Fox is finally releasing the DVD set I've been waiting for--complete with both the original and edited versions of the movie, plus bonus features including featurettes and several commentary tracks--far superior to the vanilla DVD release of The Passion from late 2004.

They answer Barabbas,and much to his delight Barabbas is set free amongst the crowd.That leaves Jesus,and what to do with him? Pilate is forced into a corner and has no choice but to condemn Jesus to death,by crucifixion.Jesus is forced to carry his own crucifix and it is a brutal and terrifyingly wretched long walk to a mount outside the city.He is hounded every step by his Roman guards,who before the march started,gave Jesus his crown of thorns.We watch as Jesus is tied and nailed to the cross and it is raised up into place.On lookers,including Mary Magdalene,his mother Mary and his brother,watch as Jesus slowly but surely slips into unconsciousness and death.The sky darkens,a wind storm and earth tremors follow.The film ends as Jesus is resurrected and the stone blocking the cave rolls away from the entrance.I found it to be an emotionally draining experience.Gibson portrays each punch,each spit,each nail driven into flesh,each metal tipped whip and on and on,with startling realism.He wanted you to see and imagine just how much Jesus suffered for all of us and exactly what he died for.There is no movie before or since that has portrayed Jesus's final hours in such a graphic manner,and I doubt if there ever will be.Gibson set such a high bar here that it is,for all intents and purposes,out of everyone's reach.Technically speaking the film is in its original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.This version is the newer two disc set which has the recut version on it.Extras abound and are too numerous to fully mention,but include everything from commentary to a myriad of featurettes.This is everything you wanted to know about the Passion and then some.You can debate the religious implications and even the reality of what you see here all you want,but there is no denying its impact.Gibson funded this epic himself and in the process created a one of kind film,in ANY genre.Highly recommended.4 1/2 stars.",4,A graphic portrayal of Christ's last few hours on earth.,1364515200,"03 29, 2013",-0.3554

766,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,310263662,Robert Beveridge xterminal,"[5, 7]","The Passion of the Christ (Mel Gibson, 2004)First, let me state for the record my position on the story itself. I am coming into this with the perspective of a non-believer, someone who thinks of the story of Jesus as a myth borrowed from other religions (any book on Mithras will show you parallels to stories that existed long before the supposed time of Jesus, for example). I took the movie as a work of fiction. I'm not sure whether that brought me into it with a predisposition against the film, or with a more jaded eye, or what have you. But what I expected from the film was an ultraviolent piece of, to be short, propaganda.I should have known better, on both counts.The Passion is a profound, deeply moving piece of work. It is also not the violencefest I was expecting given Gibson's warnings to that effect; it was less Flower of Flesh and Blood than it was Saving Private Ryan. The violence is concentrated (in this case, in the final forty-five minutes of the film, from the thirty-nine lashes, with its strong shades of Peter Greenaway's The Baby of Macon, to Jesus' death), but is in most cases more implied, with the aftereffects shown, than it is depicted. In other words, it's more film than it is endurance test. You'll probably want to leave the kids at home, but put your mind at ease. If you can make it through a Schwarzenegger flick, you'll get through this (and if you've seen anything by Takashi Miike or Hideshi Hino, you'll coast through it wondering what all the fuss was about).No need for a plot summary, but just in case: The Passion is a biopic about the final twelve hours of the life of Jesus Christ. Jesus is played by Jim Caviezel (Frequency, The Count of Monte Cristo). I'd always rather thought of him as a second-rate hack, but his performance here is wonderful; rather like Willem Dafoe fifteen years ago, it's likely Caviezel will ride this Oscar-worthy performance into an excellent career. Everyone else in the film is pretty much a supporting actor, but a number of them support quite nicely; special mention should be given to Satan (Rosalinda Cantano, last seen in American cinemas in The Order), who's always creeping around the edges of things looking satisfied with the proceedings, and Pontius Pilate (Hristo Shopov, a staple in really bad B horror films like Octopus, Alien Hunter, and Python 2), both of whom also have the potential to get into really good movies after this.Much has been made of the film's supposed anti-Semitic content. I'm pretty sure the majority of the people who see this film will come out of it wondering where, exactly, that anti-Semitic content is. The Jews are at best minor characters in this film, with the exception of Caiaphas (Mattia Spragia, also recently seen in The Order), who does most of the shouting. The real bad guys here are the Roman guards. For some reason, though, I haven't heard anyone crowing about anti-Italian discrimination in the movie. Huh. Go figure.Caviezel, Gibson, and executive producer Enzo Sisti (the producers are the guys who take home the Best Picture trophy) are all likely to walk off with Oscars in February 2005, and deservedly so, but they will still have to defeat competition. Where the film is going to lord it over (no pun intended) the rest of the films released in 2004 is in the fields of sound design, cinematography, and makeup. Caviezel spends the last forty-five minutes of the film being beaten into rapid deterioration, and the makeup guys actually manage continuity. (They mess up once at the very beginning of the film, but we'll forgive them for that.) The whole thing is beautifully shot, from opening scene to closing, with incredible attention paid to light and sound details. This is the kind of filmmaking you'd get if Hideo Nakata (Ringu, Chaos) and David Lynch (Twin Peaks) got together and had a kid, who then married the greatest cinematographer on the planet, David Eggby (Mad Max, Pitch Black), and then THEY had a kid. There isn't a mote of light out of place in this movie. Anywhere. There's not a scene over- or underlit, not a sound too loud or too soft. (Another reason to watch this on the big screen; the sound balance here just begs for desecration when it gets transferred to DVD, as happens to so many films.) Simply put, this is the best light and sound work I have ever seen in a film. It's better than Pitch Black, better than Chaos, better (okay, by a nose) than Begotten. This is a movie that will make kids leave the theater and say I want to be a cinematographer/sound designer when I grow up. Yeah, it's that good. The effects are in the realm of those foreign directors whose work is ineligible for nomination here in America, but routinely do work far beyond anything we've seen here: Takashi Miike, T. F. Mous, Hideshi Hino, Hideo Nakata, Kei Fujiwara. These are folks who know gore. They employ the top dogs in the Japanese and Hong Kong film industries to get it. They're going to start calling Christien Tinsley, the head make-up guy from Jim Caviezel, when they start making films in the west. Tinsley may not be a household name now, but he was also the head make-up guy for Eddie Murphy in Nutty Professor II and the overseer of How the Grinch Stole Christmas; expect this guy to be mentioned in the same breath as Tom Savini and Rick Baker within the next few years.In any case, whether you believe the story or not, this is definitely a film to be seen.

Mel Gibson, aside from creating the most controversial film ever, has also created a masterpiece. The cinematography, the acting, the casting, the script - I can't imagine how it could have been done better. The cinematic genius that gave us Braveheart permeates The Passion, and the story is exponentially more powerful.The Passion squarely on the last 24 hours in the life of Jesus, played wonderfully by James Caviezel (Count of Monte Cristo). It starts in the Garden of Gethsemane with Jesus weeping and praying, takes us through the trial and crucifixion, and ends with the resurrection. Gibson brilliantly utilizes flashbacks to show the life of Jesus, giving us insight into why he was condemned, as well as showing his relationship with his mother (Monica Bellucci). This was in fact one of the more powerfully executed elements of the movie. Gibson focuses on Mary, who sadly is often left completely out of the story. By showing us a mother's grief he adds an entirely new aspect, and it brings even more meaning to the horrendous torture that Christ endured.This movie is possibly the most graphically violent film ever produced. Not only is it extremely bloody, but we also see the anguish that Jesus' loved ones go through as it's happening. The brutality escalates, so it's difficult to become numb to it. Gibson doesn't ever linger on one aspect of the torture - to do so would've been gratuitous - but instead shows firsthand the degree to which Christ was tortured, with an intensity previously unheard of.All in all, this is an epic film portraying an epic event in history, perhaps *the* epic event in history - and it's executed flawlessly.Speaking to the controversy surrounding the film, I have some thoughts.Allegedly, according to both the Bible and other historical sources, Jesus was a man who polarized nations. Those who knew of him loved him - or hated him. Something about the character and methods of Jesus had that power during his lifetime and for centuries after. The way that Americans have aligned themselves on either side of this movie makes me believe that Gibson's portrayal is accurate, since we're seeing Jesus again polarize a nation. What is it about Christ, who never picked up a sword to defend himself, that inspires such immediate and powerful hatred? Why do people feel so threatened by a message that speaks of selfless love, so threatened that they need to hurl every insult they can at Gibson for portraying this story in film?The bottom line is that the claims surrounding The Passion, much like the claims surrounding Jesus himself, are entirely false and ungrounded. The Passion is not anti-Jewish in the least - Gibson is portraying a historical event that happened 2000 years ago. If The Passion is anti-Semitic, then Schindler's List is anti-German, Gods and Generals is anti-American, Gladiator is anti-Roman and Pearl Harbor is anti-Japanese. Why aren't we calling for these films to be boycotted, or their producers ousted from Hollywood? I find it sickening that the popular media is allowed to pick which cultural groups are legitimately persecuted when a film comes out. If Gibson made a movie about the Crusades in which the Christians killed thousands of innocent people, nobody would say a word. You wouldn't see Christians boycotting theaters and nobody in the popular media would be screaming for the end of Gibson's career - even though it's ultimately no different: A portrayal of a historical event in which one race/religion is shown to be the incendiary of a tragedy.And that's what The Passion is - a portrayal of a historical event, based very strictly on the Gospels. I find it interesting that the Jews and politically correct critics are lashing out over anti-Semitism in The Passion - the exact same information has been right there in the Bible, the best-selling book of all time, for almost two thousand years. Should we boycott bookstores that sell it, because the Bible is anti-Semitic? Jews may not be happy about the fact that their ancestors killed Jesus, but that doesn't mean that portraying it is anti-Jewish, nor does it mean that it shouldn't be portrayed - I think that's called censorship. I felt that Gibson went to extremes to remove any possible anti-Semitism by having a Roman guard stare down his nose at Simon and spit the derogatory, Jew, at him, thus making the Jews a victim of racism. He also omitted the subtitles in the scene when the Jews were chanting for the blood of Jesus to be on them and their ancestors.I find it both amusing and irritating that with ignorant ease, critics (some on amazon.com) casually state that the movie was unrealistic and a concoction of Gibson's imagination, or that this all comes down to how Gibson interprets the Gospels. People, these are not theological issues we're discussing here. How many ways can someone read he was scourged or he was crucified,? Ninety-nine percent of what's contained in The Passion is objective information gleaned specifically from the Bible and other historical sources that describe the torture methods of the ancient Romans. There is very little room for interpretation in what Gibson presents. If we were talking about the theology behind what Christ taught, then I would grant you latitude in claiming it's all how you interpret it. But Gibson didn't present this kind of information. We know Christ was tortured, we know the devices used, we know the method and degrees to which those devices were used. What's to interpret?The anti-Semitic claims are meaningless attempts at sounding informed. It's political correctness at its most disgusting heights (or rather, lows). I applaud Gibson for not giving in to the pressures surrounding him, and for making a beautiful film he believes in. Once again we see the passion of Jesus dividing a nation, for nothing more than the telling of truth.",5,The Gospel of Mel,1077840000,"02 27, 2004",-0.0603
769,AFLTHO3MB4825,310263662,Robert J. Willert,"[3, 8]","Mel Gibson had the right idea when he considered directing THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. Show people precisely what Jesus had to contend with in his final 12 hours. The brutality is horrific, especially the whipping sequence and the nailing to the cross at the end. Perhaps if the director had spent a little less time on the brutality and more with flashbacks about his life, the film would have earned a 5-star rating.The movie is subtitled, but I can understand why Gibson considered not giving the movie any subtitles at all. Though the film is spoken in Aramic and Latin (mixed with a little Hebrew), PASSION doesn't feel like a foreign film. Gibson has given us a visual film that needs little translation.PASSION is a great film. And it is NOT anti-semetic as many would have you believe. If anything, Gibson makes you believe that the Romans (with the exception of a few) were sadistic fiends. Perhaps many of them were. One exception may have been Pontius Pilate (a fine performance by Hristo Shopov). He comes across as human. He is indeed likeable, and compassionate, willing to try to understand Christ. But his legacy is doomed because of his fear of looking bad in the eyes of Caesar.Other good performances: Rosalinda Celentano as the mysterious Satan (she is cloaked - this really works to the advantage of the character); Luca Lionello as Judas gives a brief but convincing performance as Jesus' betrayer. And Monica Bellucci (Mary Magdalene) and Jesus' mother Mary (Maia Morgenstern) are also effective.But it is James Caviezel who really carries the film. Though his lines are brief throughout (thanks in large part to the intense beatings), it is in his expressions that the actor shines. One note of interest: Caviezel did dislocate his shoulder in one sequence which Gibson chose not to edit (I won't tell you which scene), and he suffered from other minor injuries during the making of the film.The message of this movie is Love Thy Neighbor. Yet both Caviezel and Gibson are currently being accused of anti-semitism by fanatics all over the world (somebody even threw a bucket of lamb's blood at Gibson on the street).But THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is an important film. And Mel Gibson should be commended for the making of this masterful effort, not chastised.I attended a church meeting two weeks back and the ministers all were encouraging their followers to view this rated R movie, and to bring your 13 year-old (too intense for younger viewers). When I attended the film, there were adults and teenage girls and teenage boys filling up every seat. At the end there was applause and the teenage girls next to me were in tears.This is an important film. But one suggestion. Leave the popcorn and soda at the concession stand.

770,AYZRHS2921ANX,310263662,Roberto Gonzalez Robriv,"[3, 3]","I went to see The Passion last night and the experience was life changing. It was the first time that the movie theater was completely silent during a movie. You could hear a pin drop while the people were crying in the theater. I could not help it and cried, sobbing, several times.The scene in which Virgin Mary runs to pick Jesus from the road, after He falls down carrying the cross is amazing. He falls down and Mary remembers when Jesus used to be a child and she used to run to pick him up when he fell. Then she gets there and helps Him to stand up and tells Him with her eyes wet: I'm here. That was incredibly moving. Mary's performance is outstanding, so real, so oscar winner worth. Mel Gibson really did a great job directing this masterpiece. Madgalene's performance is almost silent but it conveys so much compromise with Jesus and His family.The scene of Jesus playing with his mother, laughing, and throwing water at her face after she helps Him to wash His hands before dinner, is so cute and shows Jesus as a real man, full of God's divinity and full of human nature.According to experts, Jesus was the only man crucified with nails in His hands and feet. A normal crucifixion did not have nails and criminals used to be tied to the cross with ropes or so and left there to die of hunger and thirst. Because Jesus' message was one that the government felt threatened by, He was much more abused that any other accused criminal at the time.The movie really brought so much spiritual awakening to me. I have been in church for a long time but never really understood the pain Jesus went thru for me. Since last night I feel my heart much more free and have started feeling the grace of God in a much deeper way.I came home with my eyes wet and went to my room to pray, giving Jesus thanks for his inmense love for humanity. During the movie I prayed with tears as well and told Jesus: Lord, if I do not live my life in Your perfect will, then Your sacrifice for me is in vain. I am so sorry for all the times I have behaved like I don't know You and for all the times I have done things that do not honor or glorify You and for all the things I have done that have made You feel dissapointed or ashamed of me. My body is Your temple and I want your Spirit to feel pleased to live within me. Please forgive me and help me become the person you want me to be.The character of the devil is definitively different in The Passion. A beautiful pale woman with the voice of a man, not the manly deep bass voice but the normal voice that any man can have and the tone of the voice is always the same, no real emotion or life. It seems that Gibson wanted to ilustrate the devil as a being with no real life or emotion as a symbol of spiritual death. God is the giver of life and the devil is His enemy, so there is no life in the devil.I feel that now, more than ever before, I know God's love. He loved and loves us so much that His mercy is new everyday. Our lives should be a tribute to His love.I recommend this movie to everyone. The movie is violent and there is a lot of blood, but it is only a glimpse of what really happened to Jesus.My respect and admiration to Mel Gibson.",5,A life changing experience,1078012800,"02 29, 2004",0.1005

The review claimed that by making Annas and Caiaphas, the Jewish high priests, look so evil that we do not see ourselves as crucifying Christ, but cast the blame for Jesus death on those evil Jewish priest, hence by implication, the Jewish people as a whole.Annas and Caiaphas were filthy rich, belonging to the sect of the Sadducees that rejected the work of the supernatural and were in collusion with Rome. These men were just about as corrupt and evil as anyone could be. Try as one might, few of us have anything in common with these them. Annas and Caiaphas were evil, corrupt men. That is not to say they were devoid of any good, but it is obvious from the gospel accounts that these men sought the preservation of their own wealth and position above that of seeking justice. On the other hand, we see members of the Jewish Senate who saw this execution as a travesty of justice, we see the Jewish father who helped Jesus carry his cross, and the Jewish women who wailed for Jesus death. We see the Romans who beat Jesus, humiliated him and nailed him to the cross. Life is rarely as simply as good guy- bad guy- bad people are capable of doing good things, and good people are capable of doing evil things.Gibson hit the nail right on the head. Aside from being a fairly accurate account of the gospel story, Gibson did show that everyman was responsible for Christ's death. From the Roman governor to the Roman soldier, from the Jewish leaders, to the Jewish rabble, from rich person to poor person, from Jew to Gentile- all bear responsibility. Anti-Semitic? No way. Oh, by the way, where are these liberal critics when it comes to denouncing anti-Semitism in socialist Western Europe or in the Moslem mosques who daily cry for the extermination of the Jewish people?

778,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,310263662,Roland E. Zwick,"[6, 11]","***1/2 Is it possible for anybody to be truly objective about Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ? Has any movie ever stirred up this much passion on both sides of any one issue? For here, indeed, is what might be termed the perfect Rorschach Test film. As with the famed ink blots, people have a tendency to project onto this film all their innermost beliefs and biases - so much so that, in many cases, the comments individuals make about the film end up saying less about the movie and more about the people themselves. Devout Christians embrace The Passion as the ultimate illustration of God's love for humanity, believing that by dramatizing so vividly the physical agony of Christ's last moments on Earth, the film brings home the high cost of the sacrifice in a way it has never been brought home before. Since film is a largely visual and emotional medium, The Passion has an advantage - even over the gospel accounts themselves - of being able to convey the unimaginable brutality of 1st Century crucifixions and to make us vicarious participants in the suffering. So passionately have some Christians taken this film to their bosoms that they have even equated attacks on the film with attacks on God. On the other side of the cultural spectrum, many nonbelievers and skeptics see the film as a bewildering exercise in sadomasochistic savagery, as a man is basically tortured to death for two hours while millions of viewers worldwide queue up for the privilege of witnessing it.As an agnostic on the issue of Jesus myself, I confess that I can see both points of view fairly clearly, although, on the whole, I think The Passion is a pretty impressive cinematic achievement. What makes this film different from most previous versions of the story - even more so than the unprecedented intensity of the movie's violence - is the fact that The Passion concentrates almost exclusively on the last few hours of Jesus' life. By showing virtually nothing of Jesus' pre-passion ministry, the film does feel as if it is missing a fairly crucial dimension to the story. Even the resurrection is treated almost as an afterthought - a bit of a cheat, actually, considering how much suffering both Jesus and the audience have had to endure up to that point. Gibson attempts to filter bits and pieces of the back story into his movie through the use of very short flashbacks, but anyone unfamiliar with the gospel tale may find himself confused and bewildered and questioning what the purpose of all the suffering really is. Perhaps unintentionally, the message of Jesus tends to get lost on the blood-soaked road to Calvary.Certainly it is the graphic nature of the violence that will be most remembered about this film and I think, in this respect, Gibson took basically the right approach. The unflinching portrayal of Christ's suffering is infinitely preferable to the sanitized, tasteful way in which it has been depicted in most previous films on the subject. It is possible that the director may be guilty of some overkill in this area (do we really need the crow pecking out the thief's eyes while he's dangling on the cross?), but, for the most part, the unremitting brutality is the film's strongest point. It does lead us into questioning just why a loving god would require such a sacrifice for the forgiveness of sins, but, then, that is an issue for theologians, not a movie reviewer, to consider.As to the issue of whether or not the film is anti-Semitic in nature, that, too, depends on how one looks at it. Surely, Jesus and his followers were all Jews and they, needless to say, are portrayed in only the most sympathetic light by the filmmakers. Unfortunately, Caiphas and the other Jewish leaders in the film have been reduced to little more than stock villains, shaking their fists at the camera and crying irrationally for Jesus' blood all throughout the picture. However, since this is the way the story is told in the gospels, the charge of anti-Semitism is virtually unavoidable in any movie dealing with Jesus' life. For the same reason, Pontius Pilate comes across in the film as a much more reasonable, conscience-wracked victim of circumstance than historians like Josephus would ever have portrayed him.One can also question the decision on Gibson's part to add Satan to his cast of characters in the guise of a hooded, hissing, androgynous figure more appropriate to a cheap horror film than a serious drama. Of course, one can understand why Gibson felt compelled to do this. After all, by limiting himself solely to the passion scene, he must have realized that he was left with no opportunities to portray any of the neat miracles Jesus is said to have performed. Thus, the director had to find a way to inject something of the supernatural into the proceedings; otherwise the film might have come across as just a movie about a guy being pounded to a pulp by a bunch of misguided sadists.On a technical level, Gibson has done a superb job recreating the time and place of the story, with his inspired use of Aramaic and Latin lending a harsh reality to the scene. The makeup work is truly extraordinary and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel brings out the stark beauty of the ancient background against which this gruesome drama is played. As Jesus, Jim Caviezel cuts an impressive figure and sure shows that he can take a punch with the best of them. Maia Morgenstern as Mary, Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, Francesco De Vito as Peter and Hristo Jivkov as John get to do little but look teary-eyed and concerned as Jesus makes his way through the crowd. Hristo Shopov brings some humanity to the role of Pilate, though Luca de Dominicus makes of Herod a mincing, campy caricature.There is a certain irony in the fact that the most commercially successful R-rated feature to date has achieved that prominence largely through the patronage of people who have been the most vocal critics of such films. Perhaps the Lord does indeed work in mysterious ways.As films about the life of Jesus, I much prefer Passolini`s The Gospel According to St. Matthew and Zeffirelli`s Jesus of Nazareth to Gibson`s The Passion of the Christ, but this latest version of the tale, despite its many flaws, brings its own unique vision to the greatest story ever told.",3,Flawed But Compelling Trip Down the Via Dolorosa,1106179200,"01 20, 2005",0.0884

The filming is graphic and detailed and the decision to have people speak in their original languages was very intelligent. The film has been accused of being antisemitic--partly because of Gibson's escapades-but I don't see it. It is no more antisemitic than the Gospels, themselves. Yes, I think it can be argued that the Gospels show an anti-Pharasee bias--make that an anti-establishment bias--but they can't be antisemitic. The early Christians, precisely the ones who wrote the New Testament, were all Jews. It is hardly credible that they were antisemites. They were, however, members of a new wave of Judaism, a wave that witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem and the razing of Herod's Temple. They didn't like the Temple Establishment and their writings show it, sometimes even glossing over the Roman responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion.The film is both detailed and excruciating. It emphasizes Jesus' suffering for mankind. It's difficult to 'overdo' something as hideous as death by crucifixion but I think the directors come close. The scourging is overdone to the point of unbelievability. It goes on far too long and is laid on with too much force. The scourging of the type depicted may have killed a man without the necessity of a cross. Of a near absolute certainty, a man so scourged would never be able to pull--even with help--the cross up to the hill of Golgotha.Other than that I have only one other technical comment and that involves the cross, itself. The cross has become the living symbol of many Christian faiths but many people believe that there was never a cross. There is evidence that, in some places, the uprights were always kept in place on the execution ground. The condemned man carried the crosspiece on his shoulder to the place of execution.In A.D. 70, Jerusalem fell to a Roman army and thousands were crucified around its walls. It seems highly unlikely that full crosses were used in the executions.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--Skull Rack and Hummingbird God--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico",4,the scourging alone would have killed him,1219276800,"08 21, 2008",-0.1236

I really dislike subtitles, I (personally anyway) find them distracting and they tend to force me away from paying attention to other parts of a film that I like to look at.There was no story-telling at all. Now granted, since it made money hand-over-fist, this may be a moot-point in a lot of ways. However, if you were coming from a family that wasn't particularly religious, I couldn't help but think that you'd have no idea who the characters were or what was going on.I had heard people mention that they had thought that `Braveheart' was a warm-up for what Gibson did on TPOTC. I disagree with that on every possible level. `Braveheart' was a better film, and not by a small margin.I had also heard mentioning of The Media's over-hyping the violence in the film. I didn't think this was at all overstated. If anything, it was more violent then I expected. Now, being such a fan of horror, action, and science-fiction movies, I'm the LAST person in the world to complain about a movie being violent or bloody. I do think though, that it hit a point where the brutality in the movie ceased to have a point in forwarding the story. It almost seemed to be violent, just for the hell of it. Yeah, I know, and then I get to hear the argument Well, that was what he really went through. Well there's a difference between conveying the point that he was tortured and seeing every minute of Christ BEING tortured. I felt (in several instances) that Gibson had made his point and just continued to, visually, beat-up his audience. With a running time of over two hours, you probably very easily could have trimmed about five or ten minutes off and given your audience a little bit more of a mental break. Although admittedly, is edition of the film does make some of these scenes a little easier ...Monica Bellucci is an OUTSTANDING Italian actress that's given virtually nothing to do.I LOVED the scenes with Mary reflecting back on her life with Christ as a child and a young man, but there aren't NEARLY enough of them. For me, they were the only points where I felt emotionally invested in the movie. Other then that I felt like I was watching a one-legged man in an a$$-kicking contest.I honestly didn't see where the film was anti-Semitic. I thought it was clear that the Jewish hierarchy simply felt that its authority was being usurped and that it was the actions of several individuals in power that started the conspiracy against Christ (for lack of a better term) and not an indictment of the ENTIRE Jewish faith. To be fair though, I'm not Jewish. I might very well feel completely different if my upbringing was that of another faith.As far as being a traditionalist movie, I didn't think there was enough script to make a judgment. It didn't appear to shoot off in any bizarre directions, and I never found myself saying Hey ... that didn't happen like that. What exactly would a non-traditionalist film look like?So on the whole maybe two and a half or three stars out of five. It will certainly give people something to talk about (which in of itself probably isn't such a bad thing) but I didn't find myself the least bit moved or fulfilled on a religious level.",3,Not Quite the Religious Experience I was Expecting ...,1200009600,"01 11, 2008",-0.1049
784,AAGFBE5EM7YKB,310263662,Roule Duke,"[5, 10]","Let me be clear straight off of the bat, there is not a single religious bone in my body, I saw this movie mainly because I wanted to see what all the fuss over this, 'life changing experience' was.That said, I think that `The Passion' has taken a very bad rap from the media, for starters the violence is not anywhere near as harsh or disturbing as some have made out. In fact scenes of explicit and detailed violence do not form the bulk of this movie at all which is what I was led to believe upon seeing it called an 'endurance of torturous and grotesque on-screen violence' by some elements of the media. The worst violence is entirely contained in two scenes, a short one where he is tortured first with a caning and then with a cat of nine tails and lastly the crucifixion itself.So from the get go I was a little let down because the movie was not the spectacle I imagined it to be after reading about it. As a whole I found it was in a few words flat, boring, and 'gimmicky' if you catch my drift. Gibson tries to pull your heart strings using every trick in the book, this wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't done so clumsily and with the emotion being laid on with a trowel.Coupled with this I felt that the movie didn't have any real message, being someone who has never read the bible and only had a rudimentary knowledge of the story of Jesus I found that there was nowhere near enough detail put into his character. Scenes from his past were few and far between and failed to convey any of the good things he was meant to have done. For instance take the flashback to when he meets Mary Magdalene. We see him crouched on the ground drawing a strange symbol in the sand while a crowd toss rocks onto the ground behind him, he stands up and then a hand reaches out and touches his foot, it is a lady and he helps her up, and that's it. If I had not of been force fed the bible story as a 6 year old in school and thus understood who her character was meant to be I would have had no idea who she was. For a movie that Gibson himself has said is meant to reach out to people who do not believe in Jesus it is very closed. Nowhere do we see any of his teachings or message and someone who did not believe and had no knowledge of the bible story at all would have no idea who this man was or what he is supposed to signify. Regardless of what Gibson says, it is exclusively catered to devout people and that makes it score low for me in the story department.On the technical side of things I was not impressed with the camera work at all, there was just too much use of slow motion. It was turned on almost every time something bad or violent is happening-like a blow from a Roman guard or a gob of spit in the face-to the extent that it simply became monotonous. The music was too overbearing, it contributed largely to the 'gimmicky' feel I mentioned above, it was just so jam packed with emotion that it felt like it was trying too hard. On the other hand though, the special effects were top notch and scathingly realistic. I couldn't help but be impressed with the stark realism of the cat of nine tails biting into Jesus, or the nailing and crucifixion, the movie will undoubtedly shock some people to the core in this respect. The acting was also noteworthy, not that there was much dialog, but the expression and purpose the actors put into their roles sat well with me.This movie has not been controversial simply because of its violence, there is a wide spread belief that it is anti-Semitic. Well I don't think that it is fair to accuse Gibson of being openly anti-Semitic with this film, after all the source material does tell of the Jews as being the people who put Jesus to death and Gibson cannot help who his father is. But I think that where the anti-Semitic view of the film does creep in is in its depiction of the Jews, particularly of the mob of Jews who always seem to follow the council as they take Jesus here and there. The camera continually focuses on them as this mass of dirty and monstrous beings with distorted facial features, toothless mouths and the manner of rabid animals crying and baying for blood. Then it will switch focus to one of his followers or his mother accompanied by Magdalene standing clean cut in the crowd, wearing sorrowful expressions and easy on the eyes. The contrast is so obvious, people labeling him blasphemer = dirty, bedraggled and animal like rabble, family and followers = clean and decent looking people, that's the difference, those on his side look like 'people' the others don't. It is this which I think has laid the movie open to such criticism, as to whether it really is an intentional case of anti-Semitism I will not say, as I am undecided, all that I will say is I can see where such arguments are coming from.The Passion of the Christ in my opinion is not a very good film at all, the acting was good and the special effects top notch, but it is the direction and the way the story is handled which lets it down. I have always thought that a film about Jesus was meant to convey a good message or impart his teachings and what his sacrifice signifies, but such content is absolutely devoid here. The movie is simply a chronicle of capture, suffering and torment, and finally death. It makes me flinch to think that devout parents all over will be taking their children to see this regardless of the rating, because they think that it will teach them something positive.I give it two stars, the first because it is required, the second for the special effects and performances.",2,Where's the message?,1080086400,"03 24, 2004",-0.1882

But somehow Mel Gibson has managed to squeeze so much slow-motion blood out of the proceedings, without giving us any context for the character of the actual man, that the story is oddly passionless. And talk about over the top!

Pichlik EWTN fan,"[15, 19]","First let me start out by saying that I went into this film with the hopes and expectaions that I would like it; long having been a fan of Mel Gibson's and having great respect for what appears to be great devotion to his family. I was not disappointed.To those who criticize the film for its' graphic violence I really don't know what to say except to remind them and you the reader that this film delivered on that which it promised. It provided an up close and intimate view of the passion of the Christ. This movie is not, and I emphasize NOT the equally great The Gospel of John; this film is meant to literally deal with and portray in vivid reality the passion, or suffering, of Jesus the Christ when he took upon himself the sins of mankind. Where The Gospel of John is obviously a telling of the story of the teachings of our Savior.The music, the acting the cinematography in this film are all excellent. The persons' involved in this effort, both in front of and behind the camera did a tremendous job and are to be congratulated.Is the movie anti-semitic? The answer, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Those that wish to be critical of Mr. Gibson will say yes. Those who do not will say no. Personally, since I believe that every person born into the world or who ever will be born into the world is responsible for putting Jesus the Christ on the cross I do not see the film as anti-semitic. To be anti-semitic and to claim to be a Christian would be the greatest of hypocicies; Jesus himself was Jewish and his message was to love one another as he loved us. Also, as a Catholic I remember our profession of faith that we recite every Sunday; He was crucified under Pontius Pilate. This means that though there was clearly Jewish heirarchy implicated in Christ's death final authority to authorize His crucifixion rested with Pilate and Roman authority. The film demonstrates, vividly, the violence of the ancient world; a violence which I might add though sugar-coated by spin doctors and PR shills still exists in our world in far too much abundance.Finally, was this a story which needed to be told? I answer that question in the affirmative. The reason I think it was important to make this movie is today's Christian and fence-sitting believer have been fed over the years such waterd-down versions of the passion and the crucifixion that I believe it is a positive thing to be reminded of exactly what our Messiah endured and suffered on our account through no fault of his own. Additionally, if this film gets even a handful of us to blow the dust off of our far too neglected bibles because we want to know more that in and of itself is a tremendous accomplishment.",5,"Bold, Stark and Original; in its' own way",1077667200,"02 25, 2004",0.163

It is his first director's debut and entirely his film. It has Mel Gibson written all over it. It is a violent film from a master of violent cinema. Mel Gibson, much like Arnold Schwartznegger, is primarily an action star and caters only to male audiences that are fond of blood and guts. He has an obscession and disturbing taste for films dealing with a theatre of blood, intense suffering, and it is disguised as historical films or colorful backdrops of far-off lands- Braveheart and the earlier Mad Max films confirm this and the spiritual elements and Jesus Christ's messsage of universal love and peace are not expressed in this film. Instead we have yet another Mel Gibson hero being sadistically tortured and nailed on a cross. Mel knew he had a big audience in Christians because they have a large media he could market the film to. Also, despite the accuracy of using Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin, Gibson casts yet again a Caucasian actor in the role of Jesus. Jesus was not white. He was a Jew with Semitic physical features- dark hair, dark eyes, tan or dark skin. And he could not have been that strong or powerfully-built because he was mosly a man of peace in the style of Ghandi and his body deteriorated after the intense Crucifixion. That's all that Gibson showcases- the violent and bloody destruction of Jesus' body but he doesn't even emphasize the soul, the spirit and the transformation that Jesus had in the Ressurection.Where is the real message of the Gospels ? Where is the Glorious Resurrection ? I'm sorry Mr. Gibson. Even as a Christian I can't watch this film. It's not done tastefully and it's an insult to the Gospels. It is soo shocking and graphic that an old lady from Kansas died of a heart attack watching this movie. The movie is merely Mel Gibson's attempt to redeem himself as a lapsed Catholic (he admitted in interviews that he was addicted to alcohol and that he attempted suicide until he married and had kids and returned to his Catholic religion of his youth). It's a good thing that he's a born-again Catholic and that he is trying to be more spiritual, but he is not doing that with this fim. What it all comes down to is making money. That' Hollywood. It's as money-making factory. Mel Gibson may defend his film all he wants and convince himself that it was inspired by God but it's not true. God would not approve of this film. I'm sure he doesn't even want to be reminded of the terrible ordeal his Son went through. Why open up old wounds ? Instead of watching this nightmare, why don't you read the Bible instead or watch movies that have portrayed the Passion Of The Christ with more class.

It is not a paradigm I ever appreciated wholly. As kids we would perform the stations of the cross, following the little plaques around the church, which depict the scenes from the Passion.Mel Gibson has taken the ritual of the stations, or the notion of the passion play, and he has brought it into sharp focus with this movie. His depiction of the last hours of Jesus's life is brutal, graphic, bloody and gruesome, and yet it is not gratuitous in any way, shape or form. At no stage does the violence detract from the power of the central message, that Jesus died for us, that we could live in heaven.I don't know the impact of this movie on non Christians, but I can say that for a Christian it is a moving, indeed gut wrenching, reaffirmation of the basic tenet of our faith. It transports you back to a time of childhood innocence when belief in the life and works of Jesus were unquestioned and freely accepted. As such it succeeds wonderfully as a messianic revival of the Faith.Artistically it is beautifully filmed in a sensitive manner that involves the viewer as part of the on-screen audience. The use of Aramaic and Latin are inspired choices, as was the selection of Italian speakers for the Latin. I was worried that it would sound like Oxbridge Latin with english public school pronounciation, and was pleasently surprised that it didn't.As for the supposed controversy over anti-semitism - I don't get it. Perhaps I am not sensitive to it. But it seemed to me no more than a simple depiction of a power struggle between the Saducee Temple Hierarchy and a troublemaker who needed to be removed. Herod might have been a bit over the top, but I don't know, I must read the biblical passage and judge that one myself. I felt the release of Barabas was handled excellently with just the right level of conflict shown by the Church Elders for what they were doing.I believe this is a film that will stand on its merits for many many years.",5,"Timeless Cinema, a triumph of hearfelt faith.",1150070400,"06 12, 2006",0.1634

All of us are put on this earth for one reason...to glorify God. Many don't realize, care or even acknowledge that as being their reason, and they do everything in their power to go against that purpose.

I often wonder how the world could have been worse during Noah's day than it is now, so despicable that God would want to destroy His creation with a flood. Today's world is beyond depraved.

Grace, simply defined, is this...Love that we don't deserve. All of those reviewers typing words of negativity regarding this Holy Spirit inspired piece of film, should consider that their words are a blasphemy to God. If the violence is difficult to watch, the bloody images haunting and nightmare-provoking...they should be. How can the crucifixion be candy-coated?.

Granted, when the credits rolled I was laughing, but not for the reason you think.Think about it!What director and actor Mel Gibson (Braveheart) has done is nothing short of mesmerizing and laudable: he has pulled together what amounts to a TWO HOUR snuff film involving no less than Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Mystery made Flesh, the King of Kings, Emmanuel, meaning God is with Us.Think about that for a second. I'll be here when you get back. Seriously, it takes wee kegs of steel to make a snuff film with JC.Awright, for those who don't know, Passion is all about the final 12 hours of JC, referred to as the Stations of the Cross by Catholics: we follow Jesus from Gethsemane, where he's praying (wait...he's God...who is he praying to? I'm confused...nah, never mind) all the way to Golgotha, and on the way JC does a whole heap of dying.I'm not kidding. That's what the film is about. Now, I know a ton of Christians---including Mel---who will argue until they're blue in the face that this is about Christ's suffering, and what He did for us. And yeah, for sure, it's about his suffering, alright. But that doesn't quite grasp the nature of the beast, if you'll allow me the license.It's not about the message of Christ. It's not about belief. It's not about miracles, or God, or mercy---it's about a 1st century AD Jew being folded, spindled, and mutilated by the Romans and their Jewish subjects---and when they get done folding, spindling, and mutiliating him, mind ya, they're just getting going.You've got beating, gouging, flaying alive, flesh ripping, spear-thrusting, thorn of crowns head ripping! And to top it off, when the blood can't run any thicker or redder, the Romans get bored and nail JC to the cross. Sissies.Now, I'm an action guy, so this is where Passion lost a star. I got tired of the sissy Romans and Pharisees picking on Jesus. After a while, you think---if there is a God, a *just* God, he would give his Son full permission to jump down off the Cross and do a little Raiders of the Last Arc number on his executioners. But no, doesn't happen, no spoiler here---we don't get a happy ending; JC believed in peace, which is why I ain't a Christian.What we *do* get, though, is gore. Oh, and gorgeous cinematography by Caleb Deschanel (who did the camera-work for Being There and The Patriot, among many other flicks), solid acting by all the players (James Caviezel as JC made me actually *want* to believe), including Monica Bellucci as Mary Magdalene, the whore. That was a stretch for her, I'm sure. Oh, and we get Latin and Aramaic as the *only* languages available (don't worry morons, subtitles). Sweet.In the end, twisted, unwashed, heathen, stinking unbeliever that I am, I sorta enjoyed Passion of the Christ. I'm big into gore: I love splatter, love the sicko films of H.G. Lewis, love the Japanese gore Guinea Pig flicks, you name it. Basically, this was a snuff/gore/splatter flick with the Son of God as its subject, which, again---well, that's pretty ballsy, Mr. Gibson!We don't get the Resurrection (think of the Special Effects on that one, baby!). We don't get any sex scenes, which at least Martin Scorcese threw into his JC film. We also don't get any cool battle scenes, but I guess that's to be expected (someone---Ah-nold, mebbe? or Stallone?---should have shown up to rescue Jesus). Anyway, this film is like life: raw, brutal, nasty, pathetic, ultimately pointless. But it's still worth checking out, cochise, if only to see how a true Man (JC) faces death. You'd whine and cry like a baby. He didn't. Street creds, man.It also helped that I saw Passion as a double feature with Dawn of the Dead (2004 remake).

Also like many Christians out there, I felt prompted to see this film because I am sick and tired of the secular anti-Christian media attacking my faith and the people who practice it. I felt that the movie was being un fairly maligned. Until I sat down to watch it and saw that almost every criticism leveled against it was valid.This is far and away the worst Christian movie I have seen since Priest back in the 90's. It gives a poor representation of what Christ was about. I agree that Mel Gibson is totally within his rights to make a movie about the last 12 hours of the life of Jesus. But as a film maker and an artist he is also within his rights to give a preamble or place the film in a context more easy for the audience to understand. But there was none.The movie seemed to have less to do with the sufferering of Christ. Than it had to do with human cruelty and sadism. I have no idea why there was so much focus on the mean spiritedness and manipulations of the Jewish high priests. And the constant emphasis on the sadistic pleasure that the Roman soldiers took on inflicting pain on Jesus made me sick to my stomach and very angry.As to the charges of anti Semitism. I don't think that anyone in this film got off looking good. Including Jesus himself.*The mob of people reminded me of the Klingons on Star Trek.*The High priests reminded me of corrupt religious leaders who were more intent on serving themselves than God.*The Roman soldiers came across as neaderthal cave men.Pontius Pilot was a coward.*Jesus himself looked like a poor pitiful man, without any sense of dignity.This film did not strengthen my faith. It made me feel horrified and embarrassed.I was so horrified in fact that I walked out on it.The only thing I enjoyed in this movie were the flashbacks. If Gibson had included more of these scenes. Or even expounded upon them (like the one where he reaches out to the fallen woman-played by Monica Bellucci) It would have vastly improved the film. I am not squeamish and am not adverse to violence in movies. And yes I know the effects that crucifixion has on the body (which was why the Romans used it to as a way of keeping the masses in check) But the violence that takes place in this film is not only excessive. It is as if the film makers took a sadistic pleasure out of it.If you want to see a good movie on the life of Christ and what he was all about, and the impact he has had on the lives of billions of people over the last two thousand years. I suggest that you see Jesus, the Greatest Story of All Time, starring Jeremy Sisto in the role of Christ.

In the theater I was in, the couple to my left walked out at about 55 minutes into the film; but the couple to my right (with children in tow) cried during the last hour, but stayed nonetheless. This experience instructs my review.For non-Christians (of which I am one), this film could easily come across as nothing more than an exercise in ultra-violence. (In fact, I heard one reviewer on NPR compare it to 'Clockwork Orange.') For Christians, however, it is more, especially for those Catholics who grew up walking the stations of the cross at lent (of which I was one). That is, the film is an affirmative, dramatized contemplation of Jesus' crucifiction.The most prevelant criticism (most scathingly delivered by the New York Times) is that this film's focus on this violent end of Jesus' life demeans his teachings of love and peace, and as such, renders the film utterly inaccessible. I agree - but only with regard to non-Christians. To be sure, Jesus' teachings are important, but many of those same concepts are contained in the canons of Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and even secular humanism. Indeed, there is only ONE fundamental aspect that distinguishes Christianity from these other religions and philosophies - the belief that Jesus, as part-God and part-man, chose to suffer immensely to save all of us from original sin. As un-politically correct as Christianity is in this day and age, I applaud Mel Gibson for this unapologetic expression of the end of the life of his Christ. Nonetheless, the film will likely appeal only to Christians.What is most regrettable about this film is the other critism taht the film places the blame for Jesus' death primarily on the Jews. First of all, considering that the gospel of Matthew contains a clause where the Jew place the blood of Jesus' on their OWN hands (which has been removed from the subtitles of this film), I found that the film is not more anti-Semetic than the source material. What this film does portray is a FEW (not ALL) Jewish elders taking it upon themselves to make sure Jesus, a threat to their political/spiritual influence, dies quickly and without much consideration. As for claims that Mel Gibson put an anti-Semetic spin on the story, in the scene where the Pharisees gathered, for every moment with angry Jew seeking the blood of Jesus, there is equal time devoted to the efforts of a sadistic Roman, the dissention of a Jewish elder for not convening the full counsil before deciding upon Jesus' fat, or a poignant moment with a compassionate (Jewish) Veronica or Simon.If you are a Jew or a Muslim, you SHOULD take issue with the accuracy of the scriptures and the very notion that Jesus was THE Messiah, and I believe THAT would be a worthwile debate. But THIS is a film by a Christian, for a Christian audience. Attacking a FILM as an irresponsible action in light of a minority of anti-Semetic individuals (who will find a reason to hate Jews without a film) and comparing a FILM to institutional atrocities committed by Christians over the last several centuries is intellectually dishonest, if not perversely thin-skinned. For the vast majority of Christians, blame is not a fundamental tenant of Christianity. What Christians ARE taught, which is emphasized in this film is that Jesus made a free choice to accept a foreseen fate. (For example, note the scene where Pilate asks Jesus if he has any defense for himself.) Put another way, it is irrelevant to the vast majority of Christians whether and to what extent the Romans or the Jewish elders were responsible. To Christians, the choice was with Jesus, he made the choice, and he paid the price for that choice - that is ALL this film is about. Nothing more, nothing less.To the Jewish groups who demanded that Mel Gibson make 26 pages of script changes (that were not made), I say, It's not all about you!

The film left me feeling disturbed and uneasy as I left the theatre. I hear Christians talk about not putting graphic images into our minds that are prevalent within movies of the modern era but then turn around a praise the visuals presented in The Passion. Personally, I do not need the graphic, over the top visuals to understand the sacrifice that was made for mankind. There are good depictions of the life and sacrifice of Christ on film that are excellent that do not resort to this film's shock tactics. The DVD series Matthew is just one example.I will admit to one scene being done well in the film: The garden scene where Jesus confronts the serpent. The visual interpretation was excellent but not enough to save the film.

This movie, filmed with a degree of authenticity that has been praised by Christians world-wide, and clouded with as much contoversy, is by far the most brutal, most devastating, and indeed, the most powerful depiction of Jesus Christ's path to the cross.Filmed in Aramaic and Latin, the genuineness of this movie is almost unquestionable. It focuses on the Scripture found in the new testament of the bible, specifically those chapters of the gospel that deal with the arrest, scourging and crucifixition of the Christ. Opening in the garden of Gethsemane, the movie shows the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, and follows the brutal suffering of Jesus when he is arrested by the Jewish Pharasees and later handed over to Pontius Pilate and the Roman army where he is brutally scourged and beaten down in a sequence that is heart-wrenching as much as it is brutally, graphically violent. Many sequences in this film are shown in flash-back, including the Last Supper, when Christ shares the first eucharist with his apostles, and teaches that he is the bread of life. The movie's climax centers around Jesus's crucifixition and death on the cross.Although many critics have admonished that this film is not for the faint of heart, I would like to suggest that this movie comes at a time when faith seems to waiver. For my own part, I found that the film moved me on a very personal level, and left me weeping, not out of horror, but out of the immensely powerful message that Christ died for. Ultimately, this is a film that serves not as entertainment, but as a healthy reminder that Christ died on the cross for our sins, that man might be spared.Although some critics have argued that the film is anti-Semetic, I would counter that the film is anything but. Remember that Christ was a Jew, as were his apostles. Further, Simon, who is pulled by Roman officers out of the crowd to help Christ carry his cross when his own battered body can no longer support it, he shows Christ mercy, standing against the Roman gaurds when they begin to beat him. The depiction of mercy is present, even in the horror of Christ's crucifixition.Be warned that, though this film may arguably be the most honest and accurate depiction of Christ's passion ever, it may not be appropriate for younger audiences. It is violent, and full of acts of human horrors that, though historically accurate, may be distrubing to younger viewers.That said, this film, in this reviewer's very humble opinion, should be seen by the masses. It is profoundly moving and very inspiring.

813,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,310263662,Scott Schiefelbein,"[4, 5]","Amazon.com's star rating system makes rating Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ difficult. Five stars, the top ranking, transaltes to I Love It! It's hard to believe that anyone can watch this movie and have an I Love It! reaction. Having just viewed the movie for the first time, I can attest that Gibson and team have made an amazing, top-notch film, but it's also a movie that I don't want to see again for quite some time.The Passion, appropriately titled, focuses primarily on Jesus' (played with phenomenal range and conviction by Jim Caviezel) last 12 hours of life -- from the betrayal of Judas to his death on the cross. Completely abandoning the sugary-sweet pablum of so many traditional religious movies, The Passion shows its characters as real-world men and women living in a hard-scrabble real world . . . raggedy beards, threadbare clothes, poverty, and none of the benign halos of self-knowing holiness that plague other depictions of Christ. We get some flashbacks to isolated scenes, such as the Last Supper, some of Jesus' lectures, and poignant shots of Jesus as a child and also working as a carpenter. But these incidents are short interventions in an otherwise streamlined narrative.Jesus' betrayal by Judas is followed by aspects of Jesus' story that are largely unknown to Christians who attend church only at Christmas and Easter. A trial by Jewish elders is followed by handing Jesus over to the Romans, who punt Jesus back to Herod for judgment (Pontius Pilate being savvy enough to avoid this hot potato). But Jesus ends up back before Pilate and the elders demand the death of Jesus, whom they see as a dangerous rabble-rouser who is undermining centuries of holy teaching.The movie then turns to its most notorious aspects -- the torture and execution of Jesus. While the gore is unrelenting, this is not mindlessly handled by Gibson and his team. The extent of Jesus' suffering for mankind is the precise point of the story, and it is impossible to watch this movie and not be affected. This is a movie that brings Jesus' sacrifice home in the most powerful of ways -- by showing in graphic fashion how much the man endured and still managed to ask for man's forgiveness, for they know not what they do.This is a movie of powerful performances and visual artistry . . . for all its horrors, The Passion is a beautiful film. The soundtrack is also understated, yet important - the few times I noticed it, I was moved. And the special effects are perhaps too good - the violence unleashed on Jesus' body never looks cartoonish or unrealistic.I'll leave it to others to debate the charges of anti-semitism that arise from The Passion. As a relatively uninformed observer, the movie appears balanced to me -- most of the Jewish elders demand Jesus' death (although there are a couple of elders who question this, but they are shouted down), but there are plenty of other Jews in the movie who decry what they see -- the problem is that they are outside the local power structure. All in all, it doesn't come across as an anti-semitic movie unless one starts with the proposition that the movie tells an anti-semitic story.Few movies qualify as important in my book, but this one is right up there with Spielberg's two WWII movies, Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, as well as other flicks like The Accused, Platoon, Mississippi Burning, and Ghandi. These movies generally aren't easy to watch, but they tell stories that I should know better, and they tell the story so well that it is seared into my brain. The Passion is an unforgettable masterpiece -- it may be a couple of years before I feel the need to watch it again, but I'm sure that I'll remember every scene.A must-see.",5,"Astounding, Gut-Wrenching, Moving, Difficult Film",1116201600,"05 16, 2005",0.0247

(Saying over and over again that they wish Mel had made another Mad Max film only shows they did not have the ability or desire to consider what the film was about. You probably should not have seen it since you are clearly unable to grasp the truth of His message.)That said, I will not lower myself again to the same level as other reviewers who attack differing personal spiritual views as a means to criticize the film - I can only suppose it is because they are threatened by the message. If you didn't like the film, say why you didn't like the film. Don't call people who DID find the film a profoundly moving experience idiots because you can't understand our faith. It is only demonstrating your own ignorance to do so. If you choose not to believe that Jesus was who he was portrayed as in The Passion of the Christ and in the Bible, that is your opinion and you are welcome to it. But save the intellectual drivel about how anyone who does believe is deluded and cannot think for themselves. Learn to read and research and you might be surprised at what you learn.

That is the bottom line message - the redemption and forgiveness that is available to all.I have seen many reviews that criticize Mel for making it too violent. I find this ironic. Have you watched the violence out there on film, in video games, even on TV? I certainly have plenty of it in my film library. Our culture has become immune to it.

No spoilers here about everything else in between.If you're a visual person, watch this movie and appreciate its artistic message, as gruesome as it is portrayed. Flashback technique is used very well. For me, watching this DVD once is enough. I can't stand the sight of all the blood and gore, but know that to be true to reality as the Director would have it to be. Jesus wasn't whipped with just a few strokes as revisionists would like to imagine it to be. If you yet don't understand how Jesus suffered and died, this is THE film to watch. If you want to live in a fantasy world where Jesus' death was a painless one (no one talks about it these days!), whitewashed through quick verablizations at Sunday school at some vague notion of death, then this film will shock and terrify you into numbness. This is not recommended for feeble minded kids.If you know little or nothing about Jesus except hearsay, start by reading the Bible first, specifically all the 4 Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament. Next, read The Dolorous Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ by visionary Anne Catherine Emmmerich. Director Mel Gibson used this book as a reference to his movie. Once you're done reading the entire, watch this Mel Gibson movie. Things could be clearer to you then. Stop succumbing to sloth and go read the above first.Jesus' miracles, life, suffering and death would only make sense if viewed in a strictly religious and/or deep Christian spiritual sense. Without understanding these first, I don't know how else you can see Him. How you will react or perceive this movie depends on how much you know about Jesus, or how much you believe or know Jesus, to begin with. This Passion movie doesn't dilute the truth of Jesus and tells it like it is. If not for his false accusers, Jesus may not have died the way that he did. These false accusers happen to be his fellow Jews and other power-hungry politicians of his day. Strangely, most people would prefer to believe in lies elsewhere and cannot appreciate the social, religious, or spiritual tones to Jesus' Person, and his life and death. No one likes to talk about death and the cross these days, but Mel Gibson shows it like it is. Kudos to Director Mel Gibson and this graphic film about the final moments of Jesus' life on earth!If you're Christian, whatever your denomination, perhaps this film could make you appreciate what it means when the Church and Bible say that Jesus died for our sins. Of course, this has to read in the context of the cosmology/theology of salvation history.If I had walked with Jesus before he entered Jerusalem and knew of the spiritual significance of his mission, I might tell him not to sacrifice his precious life for this putrid human race!

I was totally blown away by the depth of love and kindness that Jesus has shown us by going to the cross. You can read other reviews to hear about synopsis and cinematography, for me this movie accurately portrayed the depth of Gods love for us all.Mel Gibson does a great job in relaying the point that Jesus went willingly to the cross for us all; he did it for love, to reconcile lost humanity with God.Anti-Semitic claims are unfounded in a number of ways. First Jesus was born as a Jew, coming to save Jews. Secondly, they (Jews nor Romans) had no power to put Jesus on the cross; he willingly laid his life down for us all. And thirdly, we all put Jesus there. He died for the sins of the world. The same course of events would have happened if he had come to any other people group. As for the blood being on the Jews heads and that of their children. I say that is a blessing not a curse. It was by Jesus shed blood that humanity was reconciled to God. God is such a wonderful, loving redeemer that he can turn blood, a sign of death, into a sign of life.The graphicness of this film was tactful because it was realistic. I am glad that it was not watered down because this world is a violent place and Jesus faced the violence of the sinful nature of us all. I couldn't help but to cry with the pain and sorrow and rejoice with the resurrection.

But why go so far to prove this point?As I cringed while watching the relentless persecution on the screen, I wondered what Christ's real message was. Any account of His passion should move us to tears and/or drive us to count our mercies.I find it intriguing that Gibson chose instead to pound us into numbness with the excruciating depiction of His last moments. If Jesus actually received the amount of punishment dished out in this film, He would have been dead three times over before arriving at Calvary.Don't get me wrong. I hold the production values of this film in very high regard, and I think it was a very clever decision to have the dialogue in original languages (subtitles were great though, thank you). The movie is excellently made, except perhaps for the predictable choirs that serve as the background score.But from a purely dramatic point of view, I felt that the gore-fest is self-defeating. I found myself recoiling from the movie and instead of being moved by Christ's suffering, or awed by his sacrifice, I felt abused by a filmmaker intent on punishing an audience.Others may well find a strong spirituality in The Passion but it was Gibson's fury, not his faith, that left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.",3,"ACCURACY IS ONE THING, SHRILL OVERKILL QUITE ANOTHER",1086048000,"06 1, 2004",-0.1666

If you purchase only one DVD this year, make this the one!Now that all the controversy has died down you can watch this film and truly enjoy Mel Gibsons film making abilities. His in your face style may have turned off some people, but I found it refreshing. How could you not focus on the suffering of Christ? How could you not show the violence he suffered through during his last 24 hours on this earth? The violence is there to show his compassion for us, his utter love and ultimate sacrifce for us, even those who do not believe. The violence was there for a reason. I find it ironic that those who condemned the violence the most are those who consider films like Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction to be works of genius.The acting is top notch. James Caviezel must be nominated for Best Actor, as he turns in a performance second to none (and in a dead language at that!). His portrayal of Jesus Christ was by far the best I've ever seen. If he isn't nominated I will forever be sure he was robbed.But the great acting doesn't stop here. Maia Morgensterns portrayel of Mary was superb and often brought me to tears. She shows the love Mary had for her son and the connection between the two actors is amazing. She often portrays emotion with her eyes, something I find many actors can not do, even the best.However, my favorite performance after James' was Histo Shopov as Pontius Pilate. Wow. This guy is amazing! Where did Mel find him? I don't know, but he should be in MANY more roles and I hope both he and Maia start appearing in films here in the US much more often.

It's been going on for centuries surrounding how Christ died and who killed him. This film does not reflect that at all and doesn't put any one group in jeopardy. It was our sins that nailed Jesus to the cross. His love kept him there. Remember when Jesus said he had the power to lay down his life and take it up again. This command came from His Father in Heaven. This is also written in the Scriptures of the four Gospels.&#60;P&#62;The film itself is beautifully portrayed and well-acted. The artistry is superb in authentic art and culture of biblical times. Jim Caveziel who plays the part of Jesus Christ so well that you think it's Jesus himself who took over the part. He looks like him and acts like him! His role is sincere and powerful. Maia Morgansten who plays his mother, Mary is beautiful in her role as she follows her son Jesus from the trial, scourging and the cross. The graphic violence maybe too intense for small children. So adults should review before letting young children view it. One may question why Gibson's film was so violent? He did a good job in sticking with the Scriptures according to the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 52 & 53. The crucifixion an ancient form of execution invented by the Romans was not a pleasant sight. According to history when crucifixion was in use unfortunate candidates were tortured or flogged before being hung and some didn't survive the horrible beatings.&#60;P&#62;The Passion is a film of painful beauty and sacrifical love of mankind. It is spoken in Aramaic (ancient Hebrew) and Latin with English subtitles. But one can understand the language by heart just by watching the suffering of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. It's one of the best Christian film on the subject of how Christ really suffered and died for all of us. It has a nice end that doesn't leave the viewer thinking that Christ just died and shows He victoriously rose from the grave on the third day.

I was born an Ukrainian Catholic (for those who don't know there are 13 branches of Catholisicsm), as a child I seldom went to church until my First Communion when I started going more often. Since then I drifted away from faith and the church once more.I always asked myself whether I believe in God and if so why. For if I do believe in God but because I fear him then that it is not faith but I must love God and aspire to be as close to God in order to acheive true faith.Now the movie kicks in. And if it were not for some major qualms I had with this movie and its underlying philosophy I would rate it much higher.The first main problem I have with this film is that it teaches us nothing about the method to get into Heaven. As Christians we must aspire to the perfection of Jesus Christ. We must try to live our lives without sin and try our best to fend off the cruel impish demons of temptation. We must reject the devil at every door. The beginning of this movie shows us some of this principle, it ends soon afterwards. Then we start seeing Jesus getting beaten and tormented. How am I to come closer to God by watching a snuff film? Am I to emulate Jesus' death and try to get executed or am I to become a sado-masochist? Perhaps the Passion was the most important part of Jesus' life. I don't know. What I do know is that Jesus taught some of the most interesting and radical things the world ever heard and unlike everyone else he practiced them.The words of Jesus could inspire people of every nationality and of every religion however the death of Jesus however cannot have the same effect. We all knew how Jesus died and though we could not picture it so vividly knew why he died. I wonder if Mel Gibson understood why Jesus died. However what does the death of Jesus mean if we cannot open those Pearly Gates? Perhaps all of those people who saw The Passion will go to church each day now. Will that get them into those Pearly Gates, I THINK NOT. Being a Christian is a much deeper feeling. Suppose we did not know how Jesus died, would we still be good Christians?These are my values and my opinions are they God's opinion's? Maybe not, but don't be too sure that your opinions are one with God's either.The movie was visually stunning, everything from the death to the demons looked fantastic and realistic. But ask yourself why you believe in God and why you want to go to Heaven before you disagree. Do you sympathize with an actor that played Jesus or do you truly love God and want to be eternally united with him.The movie was not anti-semetic. Somebody had to kill Jesus. If they didn't let the Romans do it then somebody else would have to have.

The Passion portrays Christ's death as one of the most brutal I have ever seen in any movie, and I've watched a lot of modern day TV & film with some ugly death scenes...including HBO's Rome that suggests it was a pretty barbaric time in the hundred or so years Before and After Christ.Perhaps the interpretation that Christ's death was so horrifying was controversial to some because they'd have preferred a depiction of a kinder, gentler murder of Jesus. I'd therefore have to go with deeply upsetting versus controversial when asked about the violence in this movie.The other word-of-mouth controversy that I heard about regarding this movie was that the Jewish community was angry because The Passion depicted Jews as cruel and savage. On the contrary...Jews were depicted no more uncivilized than others living in the period. If fact, according to The Passion it apparently wasn't even the Jews that directly murdered Jesus; Jewish priests did have him arrested. But ultimately--according to the canonical Christian Gospel that the The Passion clearly based a lot of its story from--it was Pontius Pilate (the governor of Roman Judea) that presided over the trial of Jesus and ordered his crucifixion. Hence, it was the Romans that carried out a death sentence and did most of the actual torturing and crucifying.Therefore, as for controversial....I say, what's all the hub-bub, Bub?As for the movie...it was extremely powerful. Informational...educational even. The film's dialogue is in Aramaic, Latin and Hebrew, with subtitles. And do indeed watch it with the subtitles; watching in the native languages adds a whole degree of reality to a movie that already comes off as very believable.The acting is first class. James Caviezel's portrayal of Jesus is burned onto my memory. There are many aspects to this movie that I will not soon forget.

I saw The Passion Of The Christ at the movies ( sold out of course ) and left the theater very moved by this film. Mel Gibson really delivers in this film. My hat's off to him for having the courage to make such a film. I own the movie Jesus (2000) staring Jeremy Sisto and think this is a fabulous movie and Jeremy Sisto was the perfect choice to portray Jesus. He gave an outstanding performance! I also own Jesus of Nazereth which is a excellent film staring Robert Powell portraying Jesus. However, Passion starts with the final 12 hours of Jesus' life. The movie starts with him praying in the garden and being tempted by Satan ( who in this film was actually portrayed by a woman ). We see Jesus stomp on the serpent that Satan has let loose..showing Satan that he will not be tempted and will continue to carry on the whole reason he was put on this earth. James Caviezel who portrays Jesus in this film delivers an outstanding performance. Even though the movie is not spoken out in the English language and you have to actually read everything that is said on the screen, it does not take away anything from this movie. Gibson wanted Jesus to speak in his native tongue of Arabic making this film more special to me. I must say that it is hard to watch all the beatings and torture that Jesus had to endure before his crucifixion. This movie really touches you.... especially the scenes between Jesus and his mother Mary. We can see the love Jesus has for his mother in the scenes when he is carrying the cross to the crucifixion site. Every time he sees his mother, it seems to give him more strength to carry on and carry on his purpose. The crucifixion itself is hard to watch for it makes you really realize the suffering Jesus went through for our sins to be forgiven. Some people might not want to watch this movie because of the violence and blood but we must realize that this actually happened and in my opinion, we should all see what our Savior did for us.

I have a feeling though that after the initial punch of this movie wears off, more and more people will look back at it with an eh, it was good, not great attitude. The entire film is presented in Latin so subtitles are used, but they're easy to follow, so it's not a hindrence.The movie mainly is on a last 12 hours of Jesus Christ's life, therefore, there is no big Last Supper scene amoung other interesting scriptures as taken from the Bible. Sure there are a few flashback scenes and the Last Supper comes up as one of them, but for those people expecting any sort of character development, especially those who are non-christian/catholic and haven't grown up with stories of Jesus, won't feel the impact as much as christians will. That could or could not be seen as a flaw depending on who the audience is.Definitely the most interesting and memorable aspects of the film are when Christ is being punished through severe scourging by the hands of soldiers (2nd half of the film); these scenes are incredibly graphic and should NOT by any means be exposed to children. Seeing Christ being whipped by knife thonged whips and bleeding profusely isn't something that's easily forgettable and will stick in the minds of viewers for a LONG time to come. That of course doesn't include the nailing to the cross scenes. These images are so strong in fact that I myself felt like getting up and yelling stop while watching it. It's not the cool hollywood entertainment type violence here. This is meant to show a truth, a graphic truth, and one cannot help but be repulsed or saddened by it. Now in terms of the movie being offensive towards Jewish people, I think that opinion is ridiculous. There really was nothing in this film to offend anyone, it was basically the Scripture in the Bible of the last 12 hrs of Jesus put to film. There were no opinionated remarks of any kind.Now even though overall this was a good movie, it was indeed flawed for a few reasons. First, I didn't like The Virgin Mary's part (i forget the actresses name). I felt the character too 1 dimensional, all she really did was cry during the whole film and put on these very dramatic looks on her face. I didn't feel like she was really his Mother, she felt more like Jesus' sister. Secondly, the first half dragged in certain parts, most especially the scene after Jesus is captured by the soldiers and brought into a dark temple by rulers of the city (i forget the names of them as well.) They stood around asking Jesus questions dumbfounded as to why he proclaims himself King of the Jews, and it goes on for a quite a while. Third, a lot of the movie felt too overdramatic; the wind through people's hair while tears fall from their eyes in slow motion, etc. There was an excessive amount in this film that kind of took away from the reality of it. And lastly, the ending which portrayed Jesus resurrecting from the dead. The 1 scene ending was too short and too fast, I felt it should have been enlongated, showing more of Mary and others.Overall, this indeed was a good movie, it just dragged a little during the first half and a couple of characters could've been written out better or more involved.

Most people interpret the bible differently, so there's another reason why this film doesn't seem quite right to you. Ya know, the bible is not a novel and isn't the best book when it comes to description and detail, so it's only logical to fill in those holes with what you feel seems most appropriate, and I'm sure this is what Mel did. You'd do it to, and probably alot differently than most other people. People have been whining about the violence as well. Well, this film is about the crucifixion of Jesus, is it not? Candy coating this event is okay to a two year old child(I went to a Lutheran preschool that had lots of pictures of a smiling cartoon Jesus caricature hanging on a cross), but we're adults here and we all know that getting beaten to a pulp and crucified isn't PG-13 material, especially when you think of the way the ancient Romans must have done it. Before I saw this I was led to believe that the film was nothing but a 2 hour beating and an onslaught of gore. I won't downplay the violence coz it is very violent, but there's really only one major beating scene that goes on for some time. There's various beatings along the way, but one major bloody one, and it begins about 50 minutes into the film. If you watch alot of horror films it may not be as shocking to you as with most other people. Anyhow, with all religious philosophy put aside, I'll say the movie is good. It's very well done, the performances are all good, the music is good.

It is a sturdy, beautifully-filmed version of a story that is eminently familiar to millions; the new spin here is the level of verisimilitude offered in depicting the last brutal hours leading to Christ's crucifixion. And that's where the film is both brilliant and maddening.On the one hand, if its central message is that Jesus of Nazareth--whether one believes him to have been the son of God or simply a charismatic, visionary upstart--suffered a gruesome demise on behalf of his efforts, then showing suffering is absolutely critical to creating the proper catharsis about his sacrifice. To that end, I found myself in tears several times, as well as filled with moments of joy and hope before the film ended, something that at my age doesn't happen from watching movies much anymore.On the other hand, I also wondered if everything I saw was truly necessary. Too many films today have a pornographic fixation on violence, and the slow-motion shots and efforts to simultaneously mollify and shock with visceral images often tread into fetishism. I found myself actually wondering while witnessing these moments if Bambi or Old Yeller were remade today, would we have 20-minute scenes of the demise of sympathetic characters not to illicit true emotions, but simply to appeal to some bloodthirsty part of ourselves that wants to see them. (No, for those looking for an ax to grind, I'm not comparing the life of Christ to children's movies; I'm comparing the cinematic experience of creating deeply sympathetic characters that die to the notion of just how brutal their deaths must be to make us feel something profound.)If there are obvious weaknesses to the film, they are mostly technical. Mel Gibson's direction is quite controlled and inspired, but like most contemporary filmmakers, he over-relies on the closeup, giving the film, as a friend later suggested, a claustrophobic feel. John Debney's soundtrack is moving, even if some elements remind me of James Horner's Glory soundtrack. Most of the cast is good, if thug-like or wan, and Jim Caveziel's Jesus, like Willem DaFoe's in The Last Temptation of Christ, is sympathetic but lacks the full virtue, kindness and profundity I associate with Christ. In a word, he's just too ordinary (even if he's made up to look a little more like a product of the Middle East rather than Western Europe).Lastly, I've never understood how anyone can profess to love Jesus but still somehow have animus toward Jews--it just boggles the mind. I don't believe The Passion of the Christ reinforces negative stereotypes, though there clearly are villains and tormentors represented here, and I'm sure some people will read into the characterizations what they will. I found things pretty even-handed, with both sympathetic and unsympathetic characters of the faiths and ethnicities that share the spotlight in this film.",4,Almost a Truly Great Film,1113782400,"04 18, 2005",0.2502

I am only concerned with the quality of the transfer of this film's audio and video from Standard Def to Blu Ray. Here goes.VIDEO....The transfer to Blu Ray is excellent. Film grain is not noticeable anywhere and details in the many dark or shadow areas are clearly discernible. Colors are rich and accurate with no false color grading that I could tell. Most of the lighting used in the film was shot with fairly warm tones and, even though this films takes place in the mid East, you do not get that golden, overly bright color grading that you see in many of the war and espionage films that take place in the middle East i.e. The Green Zone, Jarhead, The Kingdom and many others. At no time did I see any artifacting or aliasing throughout the film. The film is letterboxed with bars on top and bottom but that doesn't bother me. Mbps rate tends to average in the lower to mid twenties.AUDIO...On Blu Ray you get a lossless DTS MA HD 5.1 audio codec that, though I was reading the English subtitles, provided for clean and transparent sound. While there is some directional use of foley fx to the front sides, both the front and rear surrounds are primarily used for ambient crowd noise. However, they used them well and the audio was definitely immersive in many scenes. There are a great number of language subtitles to choose from and there is no English dubbing as Mr. Gibson had intended.EXTRAS...While I did not own the Standard Def version, I had seen it a couple of times and it appeared pretty clean to me at the time. Thus, I do not think that this film was wholly remastered for Blu Ray but I do believe that they reformatted it from a very clean mother master. This is a 2 disc set, I watched the theatrical release. The other version is supposed to have been edited for kids to see without being exposed to the many scenes of extreme violence and torture. Other extras include 2 deleted scenes that come without any subtitles but I had no problem getting the gist of what the characters were saying. The other extras surely came on the Standard Definition release as they were all in a 4:3 aspect ration. These extras were interviews with Mel Gibson and cast regarding the writing, directing and acting within the film. Basically, it is one long extra that has been cut into several sub chapters regarding the film. One extra, which I did try, was a fact pop up which came on during the playing of the movie. I was expecting historical facts or opinions but the pop ups were either biblical quotations or facts about the lighting, sets, or studio where scenes were shot. Disappointed in that.All in all, while this is not a film I will watch frequently, the transfer to Blu Ray does deserve the 5 stars I gave it for its clean video and lossless audio.All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of a film's transfer and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase as well as any number of my other reviews might.Thanks for reading.",5,"The Passion of the Christ, Definitive Edition, on Blu Ray",1379980800,"09 24, 2013",0.1557

All of the actors give superb performances.I have waited for so long for someone to make a film like this. Little did I know that it would be Mel Gibson.

Who is this film for? Gibson seems to have made the monumental assumption that the audience is so deeply familiar with the story of Jesus that he can happily jettison everything but the last 12 hours of the man's life and everyone will still get it nonetheless. Catholics, no doubt, will get it: every moment will be ringing with monumental significance. But for those of other faiths, or without one - or even for lapsed-Catholic agnostics like me - there's very little here to engage with. A series of flashbacks give us some insight into the behaviour and emotions of the other characters, but falls far short of explaining why WE should care. Gibson's aim is admirable. By focusing on the humanity and suffering of Jesus, and the unspeakable violence of his death, Gibson is pointing to the enormity of Christ's sacrifice. Fair enough.

Very moving and true to the scriptures.For the believer, this is a must see movie that provides a great depiction of the events of Good Friday. While not pretty to watch, it will make the following scriptures even more poignant as you see the price that was ALREADY paid for healing, forgiveness and reconciliation by the Lamb of God:Isaiah 50:6 I gave My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who plucked out the beard; I did not hide My face from shame and spitting.Isaiah 53:4-6 But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.1 Peter 2:21-24 For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness -- by whose stripes you were healed.Zechariah 12:9-11 And I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn.For the non-believer, it should be even more uncomfortable to watch. There's clearly a message for them too. It's the very same message provided to the Pharisees and Sadducees which rejected their Messiah.Psalm 118:22 The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.Psalm 14:1 (repeated Psalm 53:1) The fool says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, their deeds are vile; there is no one who does good.Isaiah 6:9-10 (The Message) He said, Go and tell this people: 'Listen hard, but you aren't going to get it; look hard, but you won't catch on.'Make these people blockheads, with fingers in their ears and blindfolds on their eyes, so they won't see a thing, won't hear a word, so they won't have a clue about what's going on and, yes, so they won't turn around and be made whole.And the whole argument over whether or not Mel Gibson depicted the Jews as evil is just plain ignorant. Jesus is a Jew. His disciples and his mother and brothers were Jews. It wasn't the Jews, or even the Romans, that nailed Christ to the Cross. It was our sins. And neither Jew nor Roman was able to force Him to go through the Passion. He did so willingly!1 Peter 2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness;John 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!John 10:17-18 Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay down My life that I may take it again. No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father.The message that He preached to the religious leaders, priests, lawyers, fishermen, tax collectors, soldiers, and whores, Jews and Gentiles alike, 2,000 years ago is the very same Gospel (good news) for today.Luke 4:15-21 He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom. He stood up to read, and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling it, he found the place where it is written: The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant and sat down. The eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him. He began by saying to them, Today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.2 Corinthians 6:2 For He says: In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you. Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.And the question that Christ asked His disciples is the same one He asks of everyone. It's up to each of us to respond with our own lips.Mark 8:27-29,31 Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, Who do men say that I am? So they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets. He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered and said to Him, You are the Christ. ...And He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again.Just as depicted in the Passion of the Christ. So, what's your answer?Romans 10:8-13 But what does it say? The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, that is, the message concerning faith that we proclaim: If you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame. For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.Hopefully, you do so in this life rather than after.Romans 14:9,11-12 For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living. ...For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written: As I live, says the LORD, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.Philippians 2:6-11 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a human being, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death -- even death on a cross! Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.",5,Who do you say that I AM?,1234483200,"02 13, 2009",-0.033

868,A2D63RN5LF14R2,310263662,THE BLUEMAHLER THE BLUEMAHLER,"[4, 11]","Mel Gibson's 2004 Lethal Jesus seems an all too vivid symbol of what exactly is wrong with the bankruptcy of authentic spirituality in film. Indeed, for this to pass itself off as a spiritual film is something akin to a satanic theology. This film's vision was first seen in a Jack T. Chick fundamentalist comic tract from the 1970&#8242;s which depicted the Passion with a suffering Christ who looked like Hamburger Helper as hooked nosed Jews screamed for his death. The same company produced numerous, blatantly anti-Semitic tracts, including one in which a Rabbi was fried in the fires of hell by a faceless God, sitting on a large white throne. I saw I a similar-minded passion play in which a muscle bound Jesus got involved in a barroom type brawl (in his descent to Hell) with demons who looked suspiciously like caricatured Jews, dressed in black with false noses. Gibson's Passion of the Christ is a 21st century manifested promotion for the medieval lynch mob, which precedes it.Gibson's frighteningly pedestrian take on the passion is a far cry from the spirituality in cinema espoused by master Andrei Tarkovsky. Passion of the Christ also sits on the polar opposite end of films such as Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), City Lights (1931), The Song of Bernadette (1943), The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1966), Andrei Rublev (1973 and The Mission (1986).When this was released theatrically, churches took their congregations by the busload to see it. Corporate giants like Wal-Mart stocked their shelves by the hundreds of thousands with the DVD. You could purchase your Passion of the Christ movie to take home and enjoy for family viewing, along with Passion merchandised plastic spikes. Amazingly, there was no fast food tie-in deals, The movie as a marketing event has never seen such a shameful moment because it was this movie.It is well known now that Gibson and his Holocaust denying pappy actually belong to a splinter Catholic group which, among other things, still insists on women covering their heads during mass and has rejected Vatican II's rejection of referring to Jews as Christ-Killers.When numerous critics pointed out the overwhelming Antisemitism of the film, they were pounced on by apostles of James Caviezel's Take it like a man Americanized macho Jesus who is completely alien to the Christ of the Beatitudes. No apologies were issued to those spoil sport critics when Gibson's Antisemitism became common public knowledge because the religious right arrogantly presumes it is the sole owner of the faith and Church, with nothing to apologize for. Gibson's Passion is as twisted, ugly and spewing as the hooknose Jews he grossly misrepresents in the film.Blame shifts entirely from Roman procurator Pontius Pilate to the Jews, despite historical documentation for Pilate's ruthless lack of mercy. In this, the film echoes Christendom, elevating Pilate to near saint. After all, it was Rome who gave the official stamp of approval. Echoing Christendom's big, wrong turn, yet again, the film entirely shifts a 2000 year old blame and, through caricaturization, the door is swung wide open for the much bullied upon high school geeks (Christianity) to become the new, improved and licensed bullies. Gibson targets the Jews, of course. The Jews are in league with a very fem looking Satan who, later, actually morphs into a woman and produces a reptilian sidekick, both of whom come off as hackneyed rejects from George Lucas' execrable second Star Wars trilogy. Of course, effeminacy is certainly the root of all evils and, quite obviously, a Jewish trait. Gibson expressed those views previous in a scene depicting Prince Edward from the Academy Award winning Braveheart (1995). The Jews in Passion of the Christ are also in league with the excruciatingly Jewish Judas Iscariot, who is the sole apostle here that tactlessly refers to Jesus as? his Rabbi.In this version of the Passion, Christ and his apostles did not evolve from Judaism, they were, with the exception of Judas, never Jewish to begin with. Gibson even manages to outdo Richard Wagner in re-writing history in order to suit one's hate inspired agenda, but at least Wagner could produce great art. Gibson's film takes a sublime, existential, metaphoric icon: the Stations of the Cross, and transforms it into race bating pornography for fundamentalists. Even Peter is transformed from a very human apostle who, through immense struggles and missteps, became the rock of the Church, into a pre-made rock who comes across more like a Sylvester Stallone styled first century cop. One keeps expecting to see Our Lady; She-Devil of the SS. Like much in the post Vatican II Church that aspires, in part, to progressively morph back into the pre-Vatican II Church, Gibson avoids an real emphasis on Our Lady and drops her organic, spiritual presence like a hot potato. He-man misogyny and Antisemitism are bows on Gibson's gift to the world.Ironically, this Wrath of Jesus, with a medieval agenda, connected most to fundamentalist protestants, or perhaps, it's not so ironic after all. In choosing to bypass the whole of Christ's startling, diaphanous, radical and uncompromising, charismatic message of love and forgiveness, Gibson takes his dirty magnifying glass and hones in on the bloodshed detail, expanding it far beyond what Gospel writers ever fathomed.Gibson's passion play is a grimy, ultra violent video game (complete with a Garden of Gethsemane straight out of a George Romero 'Dead' movie). It is packaged by a brand of corporate Christendom and sold as a bill of goods that takes us to a new level in realism because this is what Jesus went through for you , all the while fanning the medieval and fascist flames in stylized post Matrix Christian propaganda.Passion of the Christ is mockingly titled because there isn't an ounce of passion in this film. It is a dumbed down, two-hour scourging completely removing us from Christ, the compassionate revolutionary. Here, the historical flesh and blood Jesus of Nazareth is reduced to a one dimensional cardboard deity who can take whatever is physically dished out because, unlike you and I, he is a god. What is missing is the human soul and tragedy of the Nazarene. If Christ were simply a divine figure who endured suffering, we would not be discussing him two millennium later, nor we would still be grappling to come to terms with the meaning of his life and death.The complex Christ of the gospels is, at times, paradoxically irritable, empathetically patient to human folly, aloof, accessible, matriarchal, patriarchal, an inspiring leader, servile, the quintessential outcast, communal, philosophical, emotionally charged, ambiguous, crystal clear, fearful, bravely determined, devoted to his mother, and impatient with her. The Christ of the four gospels is divine because he is the most human of humans.Even in solely focusing on the passion of the Christ, which Gibson's film purports to do, these qualities are still vividly present in the gospel accounts and in the countless artistic depictions of the Stations of the Cross. A visit to a random half dozen parishes will reveal an illuminating, rich diversity in the Stations iconography, ranging from the traditional to modern and post-modern representations. The beauty of the Catholic tradition can be found in its expansive egalitarianism. This egalitarianism is metaphorically expressed in the journeyed stations, which confirm and celebrate the humanity of Christ for the laity.Carl Theodore Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc honed in on the passion of its subject without dehumanizing her, quite the contrary. Unfortunately, Gibson did not follow Dreyer's example. Instead, Christ' life and ministry are substantially missing meat in a film superficially charged with the odor of divine, flayed flesh. Gibson's film is so lost in its hierarchal simple mindedness that the egalitarian celebration of humanity, found in the Stations, eludes him.Gibson's recent tirades and outbursts are not surprising at all when viewing this film. Indeed, this is an instance where one cannot separate the creator from his work because Gibson's militant misogyny and Antisemitism underpin every single frame of this Passion as much as Carl Orff's fascist leanings underpin the bawdy, militaristic Carmina Burana.By comparison, Picasso's Guernica is a work of art that inspiringly captures the sense of startlement towards the horrors inflicted in this world; the kind of startlement that Christ must have felt when he realized he had gone too far and was doomed to be murdered by his frightened, confused, beloved brethren. Gibson's film is the equivalent of anti-Guernica. Instead of inspiring empathy or a sense of human identity, which is what it should do, Gibson's film retroactively harks back to us vs. them.The Gospels imply that Christ learned from the Samaritan woman. Gibson's Christ is incapable of learning, especially from a weak and sinful woman. According to Gibson, Christ's death is not the consequence for bravely espousing a world-changing message. Gibson's Jesus undergoes two hours of torture to teach us a lesson about what it takes to be a god and this is depicted as penance for our human wretchedness. Gibson even counts himself among the wretched, undeserving of Christ' sacrifice, by utilizing his own hand to hammer a nail into the flesh of Christ. Naturally, Gibson widely publicized that fact, making himself oh so humble. He sold us his sincerity in his incessant publicizing that he financed the film himself. Predictably, the sheeple masses bought it all the way, as they virtually do everything mass marketed. The middle aged multi-millionaire artist as humble saint has rarely rang so arrogant or so phony. Gibson serves as his own elitist pope.Gibson's carefully placed and publicized hand takes on a masturbatory symbol in this exercise of titillation. Titillation equals pornography, and Passion of the Christ is pornography reprehensibly promoted and sold as an artistic vision. I have yet to see a pornographic film which can actually qualify as art and Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ certainly does not qualify as art and, like most pornography, it reduces itself to a series of unimaginative vignettes, climaxing with one repetitious, dull money shot after another, appeasing an audience of Christian thugs.However, contrary to what Gibson and his like-minded supporters think, the money shot is not in the orgasmic, titillating climax, it is in the loving, intimate embrace afterword, which pornography always (and predictably) fails to show. The money shot is in that moment when two people in love, after having made love, fall asleep, one's head resting on the other's chest, entwined in their bed together. Oh, Gibson does, all too briefly, depict the fifteenth station; the Resurrection, but, after two plus hours of grinding, one had better give more than a three second embrace in the loving comfort of the ascension. Passion of the Christ, naturally, fails to do that and it is, ultimately, an immature, mud and tractor pull styled adolescent fantasy aimed for attention span challenged moviegoers, fundie porn hounds, and their boxes of Kleenexes.",1,A SATANIC THEOLOGY,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",0.0677
869,A31ACI0E88ORDE,310263662,The Great White Father,"[1, 3]","Well, ultimately that's really what this is--that isn't a condemnation, either, as that helps us be contemplative of what's going on here. Likewise, we're likely to have the same experience because this is in two ancient languages: Aramaic and Latin.I think some of the violence was overdone, but it could have been a lot worse--and it's about time we saw a Jesus film that did justice to at least what is cinematic about Our Lord's suffering: His physical suffering, in other words. This goes a long way in feeling like documentary footage, and yet it feels mystical, both with its haunting score and with the choice of slow motion at times.I think some of my biggest problems were some things I didn't understand the need for, but the worst are probably where the Tradition appears to have been changed: for example, Jesus appears to be scourged a LOT more than 39 times--in fact, I've read that medical experts have said that the real Jesus probably suffered physically a lot less than we see here. That is, what we see here is more than enough to have killed Him. Worse than this, though, is that the Romans who are scourging Our Lord have to be told specifically to stop it, that they were not to scourge Him to death.I'll take a brief side note to address the slanderous accusations of anti-Semitism in this movie. I am Catholic by faith, and Jewish by ethnicity, and I saw no anti-Semitism. A Roman does pejoratively call Simon of Cyrene Judaeus! (Jew!), but it's clear that our sympathies are to lie with Simon, and with Christ, not with that Roman. The closest thing to anti-Semitism that I saw was the boys who hound Judas, but I'm not even sure to what degree that's even supposed to be what's really happening, rather than in Judas's imagination. It's clear that Satan is riling up Jews and Romans alike, and as bad as Jews get here, those portrayed the worst are Romans (though not across the board, so there is no anti-Romanism or anti-Italianism here either). After all, the worst Jews do to Jesus is beat Him up with their fists and chains, but it is Romans who not only scourge Him (which is historically accurate), but who seem to get a sadistic pleasure out of it, rather than doing what they were ordered to do and at most showing hatred or contempt for this self-proclaimed King of the Jews. The point anyway is Jesus and His suffering, how God turned the greatest evil of Deicide into the greatest good, a Holy Sacrifice to take away the sins of the world. Why should the depiction of Jews matter more than God, or more than Romans/Italians? I don't hear people complaining about the film being anti-Jewish because it says Jesus is the Son of God (which is what bothered Caiaphas et al about Jesus), nor do I hear the Italian anti-defamation league up in arms over the portrayal of Romans. So why the cries of anti-Semitism? We say religious tolerance is a good thing: why does this not apply to Catholics or evangelical Protestants?Having left behind that nonsense, I like the choice of actors here--I didn't see Jim Caviezel, I saw Jesus Christ (and I'd seen Jim Caviezel in Frequency before this). I also like Maia Morgenstern's dignified portrayal of the Virgin Mary, even through Her suffering of com-Passion. I also liked the portrayals of Peter, John, and Mary Magdalene, and Simon of Cyrene. And this depiction of Satan was very effective.However, I counted Jesus falling more than three times, so that I lost count with regard to which Station of the Cross we're seeing. Nor did I think it was necessary to dislocate His shoulder to nail His right hand to the Cross. Also, while I don't know for sure, I would have thought the seven words on the Cross would have been in a different order than what we see here exactly. Also, we don't see Jesus buried in the tomb, and the Resurrection scene is ambiguous, and not as well done as I would have liked.Having said that, however, one thing I especially appreciated was when the centurion pierces Our Lord's side and the Blood and water literally SPRAY out. That, I think, is how it ought to be: His lungs had filled up, and so it makes sense that there would have been a burst, and the centurion would have been baptized with it--rather than, as in many depictions, simply showing the Blood and water slowly dripping down.Probably the worst thing about the movie overall is that it wouldn't be the best evangelizing tool--it's mostly for those who are already familiar with it, to strengthen our faith. That's not a bad thing, it just means the film isn't as universal as it might be. I say it wouldn't be the best evangelizing tool because, while Christ's message is not entirely absent, it is not necessarily as present as it might be. We see a flashback of Jesus giving His Sermon on the Mount, telling us to love our enemies, and He gives commands to His disciples at the Last Supper, and of course there is Satan's temptation of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, so that this depiction is not anonymous. Then again, it's in a language we don't understand, so without subtitles we might get lost--and yet because this is in two languages, we might miss something if we rely entirely on the subtitles (like Pilate addressing Jesus in Aramaic and Jesus responding in Latin).All in all, it has its flaws, but it's an excellent movie to watch any Friday, especially during Lent and most especially on Good Friday.God bless you all.",4,Less a movie than moving vignettes of the Sorrowful Mysteries and Stations of the Cross,1398384000,"04 25, 2014",-0.0277

That a Hollywood actor would invest his own money and risk his career to tell this particular story--knowing the wrath that would follow--is truly worthy of all the praise the media is refusing to give him. He's been attacked by everyone from the New York Times to Howard Stern. Hollywood was also critical--until the box office numbers came out (the sudden praises of tinsel town types proves that $$$ is the god of Hollywood).As far as the charges of anti-Semitism go, I'm always bewildered by anyone claiming to be a Christian who hates Jews. Mel Gibson said in his interview with Diane Sawyer that to be anti-Semitic is incompatible with true Christianity and a sin. I heartily agree. Jesus was a Jew!

Even the best of them, movies like The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur, have not completely been able to shake off a Hollywood feel that suppresses the true spirituality. We're so accustomed to the usual garbage that Hollywood feeds us that when something truly different and better comes along the effect is almost shocking.Movies about the life of Christ in particular have been rather dissapointing. There have been a few credible efforts, but most of them, like The Last Temptation of Christ, have portrayed Jesus as a weak and ineffectual character, completely suppressing the divine in his nature. And anyone watching their portrayal of the Passion would think that crucifixion is no big deal, the way they portray it as so (relatively) painless and dignified.That was the true genius of this movie, to unflinchingly portray the very real suffering of Christ when He died for our sins. Once you have seen this movie there is no hiding from or rationalizing the fact of His agony on the cross. That is why Gibson chose to focus on that one supreme event from the Gospels.It really makes me choke when I hear people deride this film for its violence. A movie like Kill Bill can have people sliced to pieces left and right, and the critics will fall all over themselves rushing to praise it. The Passion depicts violence in a historically accurate manner, for a very serious purpose, and people who defend all manner of disgusting things in film criticize it. People continue to call this film anti-semitic long after all the dire warnings of pogroms in the streets of America have failed to come true. Oh well. The ones who didn't like this movie were mostly the ones who didn't like the book either.Mel Gibson never intended this film to be the blockbuster that it became. It was intended to be an art house flick, that would play in a limited run and probably be very popular on DVD. It was the controversy, ironically enough, that propelled it to such blockbuster status. The hype at times was overdone. As much as I loved this movie, I didn't find it to be a life-changing experience. This movie did have flaws, as every movie does.

To say the film is in any way anti-Semitic is to be a lying scoundrel--no different from what the Liberal McCarthy myth is supposed to be a terrifying warning against--but apparently this does not apply to liberal anti Christian bigots who CAN used the supposed methods of McCarthy if they want to.On the other hand, the film is violent and gory---of which this viewer does not approve and believes numbs the audience after awhile. But the film is not nearly as blood soaked as the typical Tarrentino film or many horror films one could mention or even the highly praised gore in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.While the film is mostly well directed and acted with several elements that should interest horror film fans, the basic problem that Gibson does not overcome is that the Life of the Christ has been done definitely by the silent DeMille, KING OF KINGS and the later THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD and JESUS OF NAZARETH. Not to mention THE ROBE, THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII and BEN-HUR. There is very little left new to bring to the table here.

879,A30OXD42ZFYZLO,310263662,Thomas Keneally,"[24, 51]","Mel Gibson in his fascination for Christ came up with this version of the last few days of Christ. Since I have an interest in all religions (I went to a Catholic school), I wanted to see this to find the portrayal of Christ. It is a combination of anti-semitism and brutality with more than one hour of flogging and taunting by the Romans and the Jews. It did not show any of his great thoughts such as Sermon from the Mount. The most important thought of Jesus of forgiveness and understanding were totally lost. This means that a simplistic, propagandistic account of the events, that involves blaming the Jewish leaders for Christ's death while largely exculpating Pontius Pilate as the representative of Rome, is enshrined in the movie. One reviewer called this movie Christploitation, as America is strongly in the religion spirit and will eat up anything. Using a small budget of $33 million followed by $25 million for marketing, this movie generated a huge profit and makes Gibson one of the most powerful persons in Hollywood. As a profit making strategy, this was outstanding. People like Ismail Merchant who made quality movies with limited budget can learn a thing or two from this approach.Gibson also has ridiculous devils and Satanic apparitions popping up all over the place, whose appearance he has plagiarised from The Omen and Don't Look Now. Is it too much to ask where the spiritual dimension has disappeared to? Where is the message of love, and hope? Where is the compelling poetry of moral grace? Does all of it have to be swept away in a tsunami of fake gore? Gibson offers brief flashbacks to episodes like the Sermon on the Mount and the Last Supper, hinting in the most superficial way possible at what it has all been about in the first place.For whatever the reason - and it is not hard to guess the true motivating factor here - Gibson has accepted the hateful notion that the Jews and the Jews alone wanted Jesus dead, and that the Romans were somehow hoodwinked into carrying out his execution. To its credit, the Catholic Church itself has gone out of its way in the wake of the Holocaust to declare this loathsome version of events morally anathema. To his discredit, Gibson has chosen to reopen the same old wounds by portraying the Jews as bestial Christ-killers. If you think The Passion Of The Christ is a huge money-maker now, imagine the opening night take in Berlin and Munich had it been filmed 60 or 70 years earlier. The film features a scene where Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest whom the Bible represents as accusing Christ of blasphemy, says that the blood of Jesus should be on us and on our children. The phrase - often referred to as the most inflammatory words in the New Testament - comes from the Gospel of St Matthew and has been commonly deployed by anti-semites through the ages. Gibson had originally made the infamous motto the movie's subtitle, but later removed it as a concession to Jewish interests.Technically speaking, the film is well filmed but monotonous. The violence is so nauseating and repetitive that it is actually a relief when Christ is finally nailed to the cross, as the viewer knows that the ordeal will soon be over, and the nails make a refreshing change from the whips, canes and truncheons. Filmed in the very finest biblical languages, the screenplay is predictably terse, supported by a reliable faux-exotic soundtrack, with roll-the-eyes acting right out of silent films. As Christ the sacred stud, Jim Caviezel doesn't have much to do except say Ouch in Aramaic. As the Virgin Mary, Maia Morgenstern doesn't have much to do except look depressed. As the assorted Jews, the rest of the cast doesn't have much to do except look evil.It is well-known that Gibson's father Hutton is a Holocaust denier who recently wisecracked that most of the Jews allegedly murdered by the Germans had merely relocated to the Bronx. Gibson film has said that nothing will ever drive a wedge between him and Pops; judging from The Passion Of The Christ, he needn't worry on that score. As Dad might put it: This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased. Any Jew-hater would be. An interesting fact is that in Netflix the people who enjoyed this movie also enjoyed Celcius41.11, Michael Moore hates America, FahrenHYPE 9/11, and The Patriot. Any person who is reasonable at pattern matching should be able to draw conclusions. I am saddened that America has become so drawn to religion and gore that they would swallow such a bad depiction of Jesus.

After watching it, openly crying at two points, and feeling thoroughly drained as a viewer, The Passion Of The Christ is not a movie that I will easily forget. It is brutal. It is passionate. It is exquisitely filmed.And yes, it is controversial. But when, in the last few decades, hasn't any film made about Jesus attracted controversy? I mean, even satirical films like Dogma or Monty Python's Life Of Brian drew the wrath of those who puff up like piranhas should that which they consider sacred get as much as finger pointed in a direction other than how it was mentioned in their Bible. Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ brought out so many red meat protesters that I crossed a line of sign carrying fanatics when I went to see it in 1988.There were no protesters at the theater I went to see The Passion at. After the movie ended, I had to sit in my seat for a few minutes and let the tears stop. I felt awful and cleansed at the same time. You can't see this movie without remembering that (even to the not so religiously inclined) the story of God's plan for his son was to accept the burden of the sins of the world, and die with their weight on his soul.I know there are more than a few who now debate Mel Gibson's overt and subliminal motivations behind The Passion's strongest and most controversial scenes. As far as anti-Semitism, I didn't see it. What I did see was an angry mob whipped into a frenzy by men of power willing to lie to get what they wanted. A quote from Charles Baudelaire kept coming to my mind during that whole courtyard scene: It must not be supposed that the Devil tempts only men of genius. He doubtless despises imbeciles, but he does not disdain their support. Quite on the contrary, he founds his greatest hope upon such people. (It was only later that I thought of a certain litany from a few of our own public officials concerning Weapons of Mass Destruction.)I must also admit, if their were any Romans alive today, they'd have a case. The soldiers are, for the most part, depicted as drooling sadistic goons who relish the fact that they are ripping the skin right off a man's back. They discuss with cold calculation how to nail a man to the cross. Only towards the end do any of them give any indication that something may be seriously amiss with the death of this one man.And there is no lack of sadism here. If you thought Kill Bill Vol. One was a mindless bloodfest, then you really should stay away from The Passion Of The Christ. Mel Gibson makes Tarantino look like a model of restraint here (but if that surprises you, reflect back to the disembowelment scene in Braveheart). The amount of time spent on the scourging of Jesus and the slow motion splatter of running blood and skin is overwhelming, but then again, isn't that the point? Jesus suffered for the sins of the world. We just have never been subject to actually seeing it this way on screen before. And yes, I did wonder if it was absolutely necessary to spend almost a third of the movie fixated on the torture of a man.What kept me riveted was what I ultimately feel was The Passion's underlying main message after good Vs evil. That would be the love of a mother towards her son. The Mary of the film keeps coming back to her son, and with it we see the pain in her eyes as she watches, all too well understanding, what her son is doing. But we also see her in the flashbacks to life with the son she raised. When James Caviezel, who made a stunningly empathic Jesus, tells her Mother, I make all things new, it is a pivotal moment. For the detractors who say that the film is hollow, they obviously are missing that important subtext.I'd strongly suggest seeing The Passion Of The Christ with somebody else as a support person. I'd also state that weak stomachs or hearts should stay at home, and small children should NOT be in on this one. If you do not want to spend the money on this movie due to your beliefs, probably all the better for you, but spare me your comments and negative votes if you've not seen the film. Like it or not, Mel Gibson has now proven himself to be a master film maker with The Passion Of The Christ.",5,You will not leave the theater without an opinion.,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",-0.0537
882,AEYEAH3C78BBZ,310263662,Tim Challies,"[40, 84]","As many reviews have focused on the quality of this movie as a film, I am going to examine the content of the movie as it pertains to Protestant beliefs.MariolatryNaturally when I heard that this movie was being made by a devout Catholic I became concerned with his portrayal of Mary. It seems my fears were well-founded. In the Biblical accounts Mary appears only in the book of John where Jesus tells John that Mary is now to be his mother and tells Mary that John is now to be her son. In this movie she is present in almost every scene and her role is elevated far above what the Bible teaches. She is presented as being Jesus' support and strength during His trials. Many times Jesus falls and is unable to get up, but after looking at His mother He finds the strength to carry on. The disciples all call Mary mother. Mary is shown submitting her will to God's, saying so be it as if her consent was necessary. The movie shows Mary as the suffering servant, suffering along with Jesus. This, of course, stems from Gibson's Catholic theology and is foreign to the Bible.Emphasis on Jesus' SufferingThe movie chronicles Jesus' physical suffering. He is beaten time and time again and each beating is shown with graphic brutality. After two hours of suffering we see only ten or twelve seconds of Jesus' triumphing over death. There is really no attempt made to humanize Jesus or to display His divinity and power. There is no attempt made to explain that His physical suffering was nothing when compared to the suffering He experienced by being forsaken by God as the full wrath of God for sin was poured out upon Him. One would assume from the movie that the pain He felt was one and the same as His forsakenness.Would this movie look the same if it was made by a Protestant?The answer to this question is unequivocally no! The movie espouses Catholic theology, Mariology and interpretation. It is clear this movie has a strong Catholic bias. The Catholic bias is simply too strong to deny or downplay.ContextThis movie is almost completely free from context. Any serious student of the Bible knows that context is king and studying the Bible outside of its context is dangerous and leads to erroneous beliefs. Though flashbacks provide snippets of context, on the whole this movie shows only the events of the suffering of Jesus. Without context these events can make no sense to people who are not familiar with Jesus' history. There is no explanation as to why He has to suffer or even what His suffering and death accomplishes.Idolatry?I found it very troublesome that people identify Jim the actor with Jesus. My mind and emotions never made the transition to actually believing that Jim was Jesus. At one time I began to feel emotion as Jesus, nailed to the cross, cried out for God to forgive His murderers. Interestingly, my mind immediately intervened and kept me from seeing Jim as Jesus. I simply could not and ultimately did not want to see the real Jesus in this movie. I could not identify with this human playing my Lord and my Savior. My mind told me that making such a leap would be to succumb to idolatry.The ScriptOn a macro level this movie succeeds in presenting the story of Jesus' arrest, trial and death. It covers all the major points from the Garden of Gethsemane to Jesus' death. On a micro level it is a terrible failure. Errors on this level abound and erroneous theology and interpretation is evident in almost every scene. On the macro level it is the gospel, for it simply follows the Biblical outline. On the micro level it is not the Bible and thus not Christianity. The micro level is mysticism, tradition and poor interpretation.Gibson drew heavily from Sister Anne Emmerich's devotional book entitled The Dolorous Passion of Christ. Emmerich is known as being a Mystic, Stigmatist, Visionary, and Prophet. She apparently received many visions in which God provided her details about Jesus' last days that are not contained in the Bible. This extra-Biblical account of Jesus' suffering provided many of the smaller details in the movie such as Pilate's wife providing the cloth to Mary as well as Simon and Jesus linking arms as they held the cross. It also provided inspiration for some of the words Peter spoke, such as his expression of unworthiness before Mary. Most troubling is that it provided many of the words Jesus spoke. A great number of Jesus' words from the movie are drawn not from the Bible but from Emmerich. The movie makes no attempt to show what was drawn directly from the Bible and what was drawn from extra-Biblical writing. I am reminded of Revelation 22:18 which reads I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. To add to the Words of the Bible is a grave sin.Reading through The Dolorous Passion of Christ after seeing the movie I was shocked by how closely the script of The Passion of the Christ follows this book. So much of what I assumed was artistic license was actually drawn from supposed extra-Biblical revelation.ConclusionsI found this movie to be very disappointing and disheartening. Though I had read many reviews for and against it, I was convinced when I began to watch that I would be pleasantly surprised. I believed this especially based on the multitudes of Protestant leaders who provided their support for the movie. The list of these men (on one of the Passion Web sites) reads like a who's who of Christian leaders and they described the movie as being factually accurate, very accurate [in the details], realistic, biblical, an accurate account, a true representation of Jesus and close to the Scriptures. Alas, it was not to be. Error is abundant to such a degree that I was shocked that so many Protestant pastors and theologians could give it their full, unequivocal approval. How little they must think of Protestant theology to ignore the pervasive Roman Catholic influence in this movie. My greatest disappointment was not in the movie but in the Protestant leaders and theologians who gave it their recommendation. Gibson made a movie that expresses his faith, but his faith is not the Protestant faith. It seems that so many people in the Protestant world simply do not know enough to discern the difference or they just do not care.It sickens me to hear people expressing that this movie brings the gospels to life and expresses the story of Jesus' suffering in a new and relevant way. I only wish that people would be so enthusiastic about the Bible! God has ordained that the primary means of reaching the world would be through the faithful preaching of His Word. That is not to say that He cannot and will not use other means, but we must guard ourselves against believing that other methods can surpass the Bible. This movie, full of flaws and error, has made me realize even more why God has given us His living, breathing Word as the primary means of reaching the world. Oh how I wish the church would turn to the Bible as they have turned to this movie! How I wish we would feel the same level of excitement for God's words to us given in the Scripture. How I wish we would have faith to believe that God can do so much more through the Bible than can ever be done through a movie.I will leave you with this thought: As my wife left the theatre last night she heard a member of a Protestant church say I didn't remember the part in the Bible where Mary wipes up Jesus' blood. That was so beautiful. This movie blurs Catholicism and Protestantism, Bible and Tradition, Scripture and mysticism. This movie is firmly opposed to Biblical Protestantism.",1,Opposed To Protestantism,1098057600,"10 18, 2004",-0.0038
883,A2GJ98824GGXGP,310263662,Timothy Kearney,"[3, 4]","Without question, the film THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST has created quiet a stir. Some are quick to defend the film, believing it is almost a sign from God. Others have been rather quick to discredit the film, calling it anti-Semitic, overtly violent, and nothing more than a work a religious propaganda. Of course, many of the film's supporters and opponents have not seen it, but that's another story.Perhaps because of the media attention, I was determined not to see the film, deciding I was already a believer and my faith was strong, one movie would not change what I already believe. I only decided to see the film because people were asking me questions about the film, usually about scenes not found in the Bible. I could not answer them, so I decided to see what the movie.Contrary to what many critics say, Gibson does follow the basic story lines of the gospels. He also adds material from medieval passion plays which do not distort the story. He adds some materials from a visionary, and many of these details give the movie a somewhat creepy feeling. Poetic license, maybe, but does it detract? No. Basically Gibson, as a person of faith, presents his version of the story of Christ's last hours. In this regard he's no different from Cecil B. De Mille who added material to the Exodus account for THE TEN COMMANDMENTS or Franco Zefferelli who also took liberties with JESUS OF NAZARETH. Both of these works are considered classics, and both inspire faith and we don't seem to mind that neither is completely accurate, so why the uproar with the Gibson film?From the point of view of cinematography, the film has many excellent features. We get a sense of place throughout the film. Light is used effectively and throughout the film there is a mood that Gibson creates that tells us something is happening. I will be interesting to see if it is nominated for any Academy awards. The film making certainly merits it.Now, as far as the criticisms leveled against the film. Are they accurate? Is the film a piece of religious propaganda? I suppose this depends on point of view. If I took someone who is not a believer to the film, that person might be inclined to say yes, but for many people, the film can help a person come to a deeper understanding of Christ's last hours. Is the film violent? Yes, but there are far more violent films that have been released. Perhaps these are not religious films, but we have to keep in mind, a crucifixion is not a cake walk. The Romans soldiers had little in common with Rebecca of Sunny Brook Farm. Let's be realistic here. We also have to remember it is an R rated film, and with good reason. It's not kid fare. Should it include the entire life of Jesus? Well, we don't object when a film only tells of Jesus' birth, or his miracles, or his teachings. So why should we object to a film just about the Passion? Is it offensive to Jewish people? Here is where I did have some objections to the film. Gibson does not do as good enough job separating the religious leaders who opposed Jesus (scripture tells us not all leaders opposed him; Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus were both Pharisees and religious leaders) from the average Jewish person. Judas is presented as a bit too overtly money grubbing. Intelligent people would not come away from this film with anti-Jewish feelings, but in the hands of an anti-Semite, there could be some fuel for hatred.",4,Perhaps the Years Most Controversial Film,1079049600,"03 12, 2004",0.126

So much controversy, so much blood, so much potential to both inspire and offend, yet which has become the highest grossing R-rated movie in history... To discuss a movie such as this is to attempt to walk across hot coals without getting burned.I've always loved an intellectual challenge.The Passion of the Christ is Mel Gibson's love letter to Jesus, taking the familiar Biblical tale and spelling out everything that was previously just a vague statement. Many have criticized it for it's violence, saying that it was a movie Mel made only for himself. They seem to forget that the best art was made only for the artist. And, considering this was made for The Artist, that sets it up to an even higher standard.And, on whatever level you see it, it's quite a piece of filmmaking.Gibson certainly knows how to make a wonderfully detailed, dramatic historical film, no matter what your faith, and knows how to draw out the tension in every moment. Every craftsman, from composer John Debney to cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, is at the top of their game, and Gibson's use of slow-motion makes sure you feel the wieght of every blow. Whether the film as a whole is lacking in dramatic weight depends entirely on how well you understand the story behind the story.The Biblical crucifiction is more than simply a man being beaten and killed. It is God fulfilling a mission, while facing direct opposition from all evil. An early subtitle explains that Jesus' mission was to die for all mankind, bearing the punishment for the sins of all. No easy task. The point is driven home by Satan, envisioned by Gibson as a strangely appealing, albino, androgynous type. Indeed, Satan is onhand throughout the movie, every time that it gets to be difficult. Jesus' mother, Mary, even asks when He will choose to be delivered. That's the point of the movie: will He give in? Will it be so bad that He will turn His back on His mission? The death isn't the end: it's a tragic victory.(...)Again, that all depends on what you take in.(...)Those who truly understand the depth of the movie, though, may be inspired to hug the next Jewish person they see.I'm not saying that there isn't evidence there. Caiaphus is indeed portrayed as a tooth-gnashing villain type. (For that reason, and that reason alone, I deduct half a star.) But many more Jews stand by Jesus' side when He needs them most. There is no blanket Jew-bashing going on here. Simply Sanhidren bashing.Is it a life-changing experience? Well, I can't speak for everyone, but it most definitely worked in me.

885,A1LZVU5SRRM3VX,310263662,Timothy Michael Resh,"[10, 11]","Seldom does a large audience leave a movie theater in complete silence, but that is precisely what happened during the matinee showing of Gibson's Passion that my wife and I attended. Many left the theater visibly shaken, others in tears. I have not seen any other film have quite the effect on an audience that this one did. My wife and I did not speak a word until we were in the car for at least five minutes.I have seen many of the other Passion stories, everything from Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus of Nazareth to Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar, and while all of these have their individual merits, Gibson's Passion succeeds where the others don't always get it right. As viscerally wrenching as the film is, Gibson succeeds in capturing the key element that the others overlook: power.Gibson's Passion Play could just as easily be called the Power Play, because when you reduce the story to its key thematic elements, the crucifixion and death of Christ are about the complex power structure that Jesus threatened. Jesus, the son of a carpenter, threatened the religious power of the Pharisees over the Jewish people. He threatened the power of Pilate to keep the Jewish population in line. Herod, when Jesus is brought before him, however, is short-sighted enough to believe that, because Jesus does not perform a miracle on demand for him, Jesus has no power over him. Herod, of course, further ridicules Jesus and sends him back to Pilate.The thematic element of power undergirds all others in the film, and could be summed up in one of the lines of dialogue (roughly approximated here) that is taken from the gospel of John. Before he is sentenced to crucifixion, Jesus says to Pilate: You have no power over me except what is given from above. Therein lies the reminder that, although the earthly powers that be have beaten Jesus to a bloody pulp, mocked him, tormented him, and killed him in perhaps the most painful way possible, they truly have no power over him.As for the pre-release charges of anti-semitism, I am unconvinced that the film is anti-semitic. If this film is anti-semitic, then so is the entire New Testament. Although Caiaphas and some of the high priests are ultimately depicted as forcing Pilate's hand in crucifying Christ, there are notable dissenting voices among the high priests who feel that the charges against Christ are ridiculous. These high priests are quickly silenced and shoved out of the way by the high priest. I found the depictions of the Pharisees to be less favorable in Lloyd Webber's musical than in this film, and with the passage of time, the controversies over Superstar have died down considerably. I expect that the same will occur with this film.More disturbing than the singular hatred Caiaphas and other members of the Pharisees display toward Jesus is the merry brutality of the Romans, the group that comes off most poorly in the film. The centurions who carry out the graphic and bloody scourging of Christ are not just following orders--they visibly enjoy the torment they are inflicting. They believe they hold the ultimate power over Christ's physical body, and beat and ridicule him mercilessly, baring their awful teeth in sneers of derision from the courtyard where Christ is scourged all the way to Golgotha. If anyone is to be reviled, it is the Roman centurions.Another theme that Gibson captures so well in the film is the battle raging between the larger powers of good and evil. A pale, androgynous creature that we can only assume to be Satan appears throughout the film, reminding us that although this drama is the passion of the Christian God incarnate in a man, there is much more at stake than the petty power play on earth--the forces of good and evil have thrown down the gauntlet in Jerusalem.Gibson also acknowledges the fact that the crucifixion isn't the end of the story of Christ. Where Lloyd Webber's musical stops at the cross, Gibson's continues, albeit briefly, to the resurrection. Not that anyone can really give spoilers to one of the best-known plot lines of all time, but without giving too much away, let me just say that Gibson recognizes that the ultimate power play happens after the death of Jesus. Although he gives it somewhat short shrift in the closing moments of the film, we get a hint of the joy that is the Christian Easter holiday after getting hit with two hours of the brutal pain that is Good Friday in the Christian tradition.An ecumenical masterpiece, Gibson's work will be remembered by Christians long after the petty controversies have died down as a graphic reminder of Christ's suffering, death, and resurrection for the sins of the world. While the movie is certainly too intense for anyone younger than teenagers, it is a brutally accurate and moving experience for adults of any faith. The acting is magnificent, and the cinematography and score will move even the hardest of hearts. A must-see film for people of any faith who want to understand what the Christian faith is all about.",5,"Mel's Passion is a Powerful, Gripping Film",1079395200,"03 16, 2004",-0.1492

Coming out of this movie, my faith was more intensified by what was probably the most graphic and yet closely accurate depiction of Jesus' last 12 hours on earth. But the real deal I want to get to is the fact that it was not Jews that put Jesus to the cross nor was it the Roman soldiers, it was humanity. Our sins and our disobedience to God is what did it. People can say that based on this interpretation, Jesus' own people sentenced him to be crucified or that the Romans were made to be like drunk lunatics. But I see it as a showcase of how deep our sin, as one race, got and it needed someone of the stature of Jesus Christ to go through this torture and death to be purged of that. THAT's what this was about. It was a message of sacrifice and a message of love, something that was even told well through flashbacks to the Passover dinner and the sermon on the Mount.The acting was good and each role filled out just wonderful. James Caviezel played the Jesus character unbelievably well, showing the Son of God as human as he can be through his fears of what's to come but yet the courage to fulfill the will of God for the sake of his people. Mary Magdalene was done well too and I couldn't help but feel what she was feeling when the whipping began. And the actress for Satan was just plain freaky. Satan never really talked much but you always felt Satan's presence throughout each key point in the movie. I personally thought the scene with Judas' betrayal and death was done very good with the kids tugging and tugging him during his guilt trip. Overall here, the acting was good enough in that everyone was showing their anguish over what was being done.Now for the gory parts: I personally felt it wasn't that gory. I'm not trying to put down the suffering Jesus went through because God knows I would not want to go through that at all. But there are hundreds of horror and suspense flicks out there that just pour buckets of blood that I would not recommend to the weak of heart and this one would not be on that same level with those flicks in terms of spilt blood. BUT it was graphic in the sense that Mel Gibson made every whipping and each nail that pierced Jesus' flesh look real, nothing watered down, like you actually felt the pain (I really cringed on that one whip shot that you most likely know of). So it was more of a psychological sense of intense violence in that it was bloody and it felt real.A couple of weaknesses I could point out would be explaining a couple of scenes to the non-believers. I'm not sure they'll understand why Satan was carrying a disfigured baby during the whipping (I still don't understand that part either) or why Satan was screaming from the depths of hell. It's not an entirely big deal but it would help to flesh out why this is occurring, even for a few more seconds but I know Mel wouldn't want to go off on tangents.Overall, this is something that needs to be seen, whether you're Christian or not. I think if you can open your heart to this message that this could be a life-changing experience for the non-believer and a faith-strengthening experience for the believer. Put aside the controversies you've heard of this being spiteful towards Jews and realize what WE as human beings have done to Him. WE persecuted Him and WE nailed him to the cross. This movie is about what one man went through to save us from sin and is a demonstration of the depth of God's awesome and abundant love for us, that He is willing to part away of His own Son, to have him suffer so much because of the depths of our sin, to release us from that very sin.

I found myself saying to the screen more than once during that time, Will you just get there already?? It was like watching Frodo with the number of times he fell down in a single scene.I also don't understand why the director chose to ignore well-documented historical facts such as that crucifixion was done through the wrists and not the hands, as the hands would not be able to support the weight of the body when nailed the way Jesus is depicted in this movie.I also found it odd that even though the director was supposedly going for accuracy, the crucified men were not naked, as historically was done by the Romans. Apparently it's okay to watch violence on one's deity but not nudity of that deity for whatever bizarre reason?My summary:This is a poorly directed snuff film with little regard for historical accuracy; but since it's a religious film, it is zealously defended by those who don't care to actually THINK about it.",1,Snuff flick for Christians,1097539200,"10 12, 2004",-0.0951

The fact is that Christ's story is fundamentally a Jewish story ergo most of the major characters, for good or ill, are going to be Jewish.Having said all that I believe The Passion is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.

The Passion follows the last hours of Jesus' life from him being arrested to his trial all the way through his punishment and crucifixion. Director Mel Gibson wanted to make a movie that realistically showed what Jesus went through in his final hours, and he definitely accomplished what he set out to do. Passion is pretty accurate in telling the story of Jesus' crucifixion although not much background is given to the story. Much of the controversy was caused by cries of anti-Semitism, which I disagree with, and the extreme levels of violence. This is a very graphic movie from beginning to end. What sets it apart from most movie violence is that it is all realistic. The movie follows the Roman soldiers scourging Jesus as well as a horrific crucifixion scene. All of these scenes are hard to watch, and I think that is what Gibson wanted to do when he made this movie. His goal was to show what horrible things Jesus Christ went through in his last hours, and I don't think he could have made it any more believable.Judging the movie as a film is much easier than examining the controversy behind it. This is a beautifully shot movie with incredible cinematography from Caleb Deschanel. Passion brings you into ancient Jerusalem at the time of Jesus' life. Equally as good is the score by composer John Debney. Debney turns in an excellent middle eastern/arabic theme soundtrack that is perfect for the movie. It is very moving, but it does not overpower the rest of the movie.James Caviezel is incredible as Jesus. Unlike previous actors who have played Jesus, Caviezel actually looks somewhat like what Jesus would have looked like, or at least more so than Max van Sydow. The whole movie is spoken in ancient Aramaic and Latin with Caviezel leading the way. He gives an incredible performance. Monica Belluci and Maia Morgenstern are excellent as Mary Magdalen and Mary, the mother of Jesus. Some of the more notable supporting cast includes Hristo Jivkov as the apostle John, Mattia Sbragia as the high pries Caiphas, Francesco de Vito as the apostle Peter, Hristo Shopov as Pontius Pilate, Fabio Sartor as the Roman centurion Abenader, and Rosalinda Celentano as Satan. The DVD offers a beautiful looking widescreen presentation, but no other extras.

Its Truth is borne out by the degree to which it is hated - like Christ was.It is a medieval view of Jesus' Passion that Mel Gibson gives us. Gibson, a product of the Medieval Tridentine Mass, is the only man who could do it.As Rev. Carter Heyward, Professor of Theology, Episcopal Divinity School said, [The] movie illuminates a medieval, not biblical, interpretation that it is the blood of Christ that saves humankind. Not Jesus' life, not his healings or his wisdom, not his teaching or his compassion, not his passion for justice, but rather his death on the cross is what saves humankind; and moreover, his death on the cross as willed by his Father God, who requires him to suffer this excruciating death as payment for the sins of the world.As a Protestant steeped all-too-often in the divinity of Christ - I loved the Catholic focus on the humanity of Christ - his blood, sweat, and tears.

Viewers are invited to see how it really might have happened, even hearing the words as they were actually spoken (with English subtitles, that proved effortless to follow). Jesus suffered and agonized in a very human, yet Spirit-empowered manner. Mary was both strong and broken...what incredible suffering! Romans and Jews came across realistically--some hardened and cruel, others questioning and troubled. Christians will rediscover the gravitas of Christ's sacrifice, and the depth of God's love. Seekers will either be drawn or repulsed, depending on whether they ultimately accept the truth of this most troubling story. Enemies and opponents of the Christian faith will do as they have...disect hints of unfairness, obsessiveness, or exclusiveness in this telling of the gospel story. After all, to those who do not believe, the Cross and its story are an offense, even according to the Bible.What the Passion is not: 1. The Anti-Semitism charge is absurd. Jesus calls on the Father to forgive the sins of those present. He is shown fighting Satan, more than he is the Sanhedrin. Christians Scripture declare that we (and Jesus) battle spirits and principalities, not flesh and blood. Gibson cleverly included this aspect, by introducing demons and the Devil into the plot. 2. Gratutiously violent. Yes, the scourging is brutal, as are the baring of the cross to Calvary, and the crufixion itself. However, the violence is real and natural, not the silly stuff one sees in horror and generically violent movies.The Passion of the Christ garners five stars for an original, passionate, powerful, and courageous approach to a 2000 year old story about how God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only son, so that if we believe in him, we'll not die...we'll live--really live!",5,"All the Passion, No Anti-Semitism or Gratuitous Violence",1078012800,"02 29, 2004",-0.16

896,A19KVHOG0DGM4P,310263662,"Tony Hall If the movie stinks, just don't go!","[24, 73]","I walked away from this film feeling like I'd just left one of the most gory horror movies ever. I mean the movie is non stop Jesus beating from beginning to end. It becomes so monotonous that the constant sound of lashings could almost put you to sleep. I have no problem with Mel Gibson's fondness for gore and violence. However, I thought that the level of violence portrayed in this movie was a)annoying, b)repetitive, c)over dramatic, and d)unrealistic.First, let me explain why I think the violence is unrealistic. For one thing, the Jews have brought Jesus to the Romans to be put to death for blasphemy. The Romans don't want to kill him. After much pressure from the Jews the Roman's reluctantly decide to put him to death. Ok, so you'd assume that a reluctant party would go easy on him right? Wrong. Instead of going easy on him, they treat him WAY worse than any of the other condemned men. Before the Romans agreed to kill him, they agreed to punish him. They thought that this might appease the Jews. So, Pilot sends Jesus off to be punished, but the slap happy Romans get a little carried away and thrash him within an inch of his life. This lengthy beat fest is finally interrupted by a supervisor that scolds them and tells them that they're not supposed to beat him to death. That scene was way over embellished and the reason for the beating being a misunderstanding made me roll my eyes.The prejudice doesn't end there. Not only was Jesus beaten until he looked like Freddy Kruger, but he was also the only condemned man that had to carry his own cross. The others only had to carry the horizontal part. Not only did Jesus have to carry his cross (which was almost too much for him to pick up), but he was beaten the whole way there.I guess what really ruined this movie for me is that only a really religious person could pull off such a gross exaggeration of what most likely happened. To Mel Gibson, the more blood and gore and beating and suffering, the more Jesus loves everyone. Ok, that's understandable... it just doesn't make good cinema.My other problem with the movie are the characters. I'm not a Jew and I don't think the movie is just anti-Semitic propaganda as some people would suggest. HOWEVER... I thought it was terrible the way that Mel portrayed Ponchas Pilot as an innocent man, while dumping the full burden of Jesus' death on the Jews and especially the Jewish high priest. The Jews in the movie are played by unattractive and villainous looking people. They are also portrayed as unreasonable, evil, and bloodthirsty. Although Satan makes a cameo in this film, he doesn't play the bad guy, that's the roll of the Jews. Of course the Jews weren't innocent according to the gospels, but this movie twists reality to give a disproportionate amount of blame to the Jewish people.Another stereotype that I hated in this film was the ever present sadistic Roman. Other than the good guy Ponchas Pilot, nearly every other Roman was a sadistic beast... almost a demon that seemed severely intoxicated and unable to stop torturing. They were portrayed as bumbling evil fools who's arms never stopped slashing and whipping. That was totally unrealistic. I don't think people like that exist. You may have to travel far (to Hell?) to find people that are that stupidly evil.Finally, I thought Satan's first appearance under the bridge was totally Lord-of-the-rings. His first and last appearance was just completely silly and uncalled for. He played no role, just kinda hung out and hissed or occasionally made some monstrous sound. It was totally gay and had no real place in the story. Jesus' character wasn't very prominent in the story either. The only time he actually showed any character was in a flash back to when he was building a table.just a couple of other problems that I had with the film: Due to the fact that the actors had to speak Aramaic and the audience has to read subtitles, everyone spoke in very short sentence or phrases. That's just completely unrealistic. People in that part of the world speak like a million miles an hour. They could probably rattle off a couple pages of text in a few seconds. But in this movie, nobody says more than a couple words at a time. Instead of any meaningful dialog, there's only blood, guts, and gore.The final jab at Jesus when he's been crucified was the last straw for me (as far as the gore factor is concerned). This was just sooo ridiculous I shook my head. To make sure that Jesus was dead, they stabbed him with a spear. This caused Jesus' blood to spray out of his side like a shower head for like 30 seconds. PLEASE! What's next... all of his internal organs spewing out all over the place?! Stop with the over dramatic gore.There were certain things that I liked about the movie. The cinematography was awesome and when I wasn't being annoyed by the exaggerated violence, I was actually kinda enjoying it.Although I seem to really dislike this film, it really wasn't terrible. I realize that Mel Gibson's faith is based on Jesus' suffering and his dad is one of those Jew hating Holocaust deniers, but for an audience of regular Joe's this was just too much. I'd give it a C- and advise older people with heart conditions to stay at home... unlike the lady that had a heart attack during the crucifixion scene on opening night.",1,"God-Aweful!

He seemed uneasy in discharging duties that would cause harm to Jesus. Was this historically accurate? I don't know.Gibson wanted to hammer home the point of Jesus' suffering while almost glossing over Jesus' teachings in flashbacks. I felt that the Christian message that Jesus died for our sins wasn't well explained. Perhaps this is a point of faith.

Yes, I agree that, to get to know the whole truth about Jesus that we should know more about his teachings, etc. but on the other hand, the movie is representative of his last twelve hours and that is what it portrays. It does have some very good flashbacks throughout the movie of Jesus's life and teachings (but not enough for me). As far as this being taken as anti-semitic, it shouldn't be, because Jesus was a Jew himself and there was a very good reason that he would be betrayed by them (the jealous ones of the temple not the majority of the Jews because Jesus had developed many of them as his followers) and this is shown in Romans 11. It was because this way all of us, not just the Jews would have eternal life. God and Jesus both knew everything that would happen, it was not by accident.As far as the violence and suffering that Jesus suffered at their hands, it was indeed true, and in reading the Bible there is a place in it that makes mention of what had been done to Jesus-this is in one of the books of prophecy talking about the end of times, where it describes when the kings see Jesus and see all the atrocities that he took when he took on all our sins, where he is almost unrecognizable as a man or heavenly person. Then they understood what he had done. It is not an easy thing to see someone else suffer for the sins we have done, yet by seeing what he went through because God loved us so much and Jesus's love for his Father and us that he would give the ultimate sacrifice, it shows us how much we are loved. Through his taking on our sins and dying for us, he has defeated Satan. When Satan caused Eve to eat of the tree of Knowledge after God said that they weren't suppose to and that they would die if they did, he made it so that instead of eternal life that we would all die, but God triumphed when Jesus took on our sins. We have the choice to make whether we want to follow God or Satan's path.One of the most touching scenes in the movie was when his mother kneels and lays down over the spot where Jesus is incarcerated and they both reach to touch each other through the floor, unable to see each other, but knowing they are there. It brought tears to my eyes.I would have liked to have seen a more glorious ending when Jesus rose from the crypt, but as no human saw it because he was shut up in the sepulcher when it happened, then it was probably as accurate as it could be, and as the movie doesn't show the part where he returns later because the movie is representing only the last hours of his life before he dies on the cross.I knocked off a star because I feel that his teachings were equally important as when he was crucified-not more important, both work together to give us the whole picture.

However, the film's merit lies not in there; Mel Gibson-directed film shows unexpectedly dramatic aspect of the historical and religious events of 2000 years ago, stressing the humanity of Christ and the people surrounding him.The plot is one of the most famous ones, so I don't repeat it. The incidents are familiar ones -- from the prayer in the garden of Gethsemane to the crucification -- and Mel Gobson follows these events with the tactful editing and very effective flashbacks that depict equally famous moments in Christ's life -- Madgalene or the Last Supper. Jim Caviezel literally becomes the image (our most shared image) of the Christ while Monica Bellucici plays Magdalene. But the most impressive is Maia Morgenstern as Mary, whose pain of watching her only son being killed is more painful to see than the bloody tortune scenes of the film.You already heard the talk about the blood the film shows. Even though Mel avoids too direct descriptions, it is true that the scenes of the torture and the crucification by the Romans are very graphic. You can smell the blood, and if you're a kind of a person who haven't seen the recent horror films, prepare for the shock.I said horror, and the allusion should be justified when some scenes really look like that. The Satan played by Rosalinda Celentano (oh, and her voice is provided by a male actor) is incredibly spooky, while the last of Judas is, well, as you know, not a happy one to see.But the greatest merit of watching The Passion of the Christ is, to me, that we can re-experience the incidents which we though we knew. Actually, the story is a multi-layered one involving such people as Mother Mary and Pilate, whom the film does not forget to describe. One of the most touching moments comes with the flashback scenes when the film shows how Christ and his mother talk to each other about one small thing -- a table he made which will never catch on. To see Mary cares her son as our own mothers do is so full of heart-breaking truth.Yes, the film is too cruel, and the blood could be overshadowing the spiritual aspects of the Christ. And some say, quite understandably, this could be anti-Semitic though the film is clearly trying to avoid it. Frankly, I don't know.

Just about every film about Jesus that I've ever seen before THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, glossed over all the pain and suffering Jesus went through. It had always been one of my intentions that if I ever made it in Hollywood, that I wanted to make a film about Jesus and his suffering that was true to scripture and full of all the graphic and vivid details. About a year ago, I learned of Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST and knew then that Mel was basically making the movie I had always wanted to see made.THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is exactly that, it is a fairly in-depth look at Jesus's last 12 hours on Earth before His death and all the pain and suffering He went through to save all of humankind. The movie opens with a passage from Isaiah. Then takes the viewer to the Garden of Gethsemane where Jesus is praying with God to take this cup (chalice) from Him. The suffering is so great that He is sweating blood. In this scene at Gethsemane, Satan is there, whispering from a tree, probably much like he did in Eden. He tries to convince Jesus that one man cannot possibly bear all the sins of the world. The scene ends with Jesus stomping on the head of a serpent and the entrance of Judas and the temple troops into the garden. I mention this scene because it is really the only part in the movie that the spiritual burden of the passion is illustrated: Jesus isn't just preparing to go through extreme physical torture, He is also preparing to take upon Himself all the sins of the world. This spiritual element is just as important as the physical.The rest of the film follows the story found in the Gospels. Jesus is brought before the Jewish council, then before Pilot, then to Herod, then back to Pilot. He is beaten, then finally sentenced to be crucified. We follow Him through the streets of Jerusalem to Golgotha where He is nailed upon the cross and dies. But the story doesn't end there. The sky turns black, the temple is torn in two, and the ground rumbles with a massive earthquake, and the film ends with a brief scene from the resurrection.The acting in the film is superb. I can only imagine how difficult it must have been to have so many people speaking languages which until fifteen years ago were considered dead. The cinematography is splendid. The musical score full of vigor and life. Gibson's direction is practically flawless and now he is probably a better director than he is an actor.As for some of the criticism against the film. The film is not anti-sematic. The movie makes a point out of showing how brutal the Romans were in dishing out punishment and death. Other than a minor beating by the temple guards, the Jewish leaders had very little to do with the actual torture of Jesus.The film is also violent, but that's really the point. Christ endured so much to save us. We often forget that. However, even though the movie is violent, there have been many other films that I think were much more so. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is probably just as violent as THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, but both films are moving and have strong messages. Any Quentin Tarantino film ever made is far more violent than THE PASSION. One difference is that in THE PASSION, the violence is all directed towards one man, whereas in most other movies, the violence tends to be spread out amongst several people. ...Overall, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is a very moving film, full of vivid images, great acting, sound direction, and a powerful score.

It gave both conservative Catholics and evangelicals an excuse to drop the cudgels of a centuries-old antagonism and rally around the pet project of a well-heeled schismatic madman.

In King of Kings, Jesus was played by a man who has often been referred to as Malibu Jesus for his blue eyes and sandy/dirty blond hair. And in Jesus of Nazareth AND the aforementioned K.O.K., the lack of realism in the sufferings of Christ. They both did a good job overall of shwing what Jesus was all about, but the Bible is very clear in the prophecies of Isaiha Ch. 52 & 53, and in Psalms 22 that Jesus was to be beaten to the point where He was hardly recognizable. Well this movie DELIVERS. I was moved deeply. I cried and was even shaking a bit during the scourging scene which took about 10 minutes to get through. Never before has there been a more Biblically accurate portrayal of the gift of God's love through His Son's sacrifice on the cross. Every blow, every rip in His flesh was taken for my sake. Through Him I have forgiveness and am reconciled to God the Father. I have been a Christian for most of my life. I accepted that gift of salvation a long time ago. But this film made it that much more real. Seeing such a realistic depiction of what I've read for years and believed on, and saw in my minds eye...well, it has changed my life. Jim Caviezel played the role beautifully. And there are some wonderful stories surrounding the making of the film. He should get an Academy Award, but the anti-Christ Hollywood will make sure that doesn't happen. Heck the whole film should be Best Picture and the many of the actors who played in this SHOULD win awards. His eyes were brown and his hair dark, add to that the fact that he himself is Jewish and you've got a pretty believable looking Jesus of Nazareth.

Chan vandelist,"[3, 6]","Mel Gibson's The Passion of The Christ is unassuming, and true to Biblical literature and Catholic theology (see The Dolorous Passion of Christ by Anne Catherine Emmerich). He also artfully and beautifully illustrates the dichotomy of good and evil, and a humanity that is faced to side either of the extremes. Visually stunning with awe-inspiring cinematography, it is more than telling with every scene what Gibson implies: praying in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus is weak, afraid, and taunted. Having Satan appear in this scene reminisces of the temptation of Christ, with Satan's presence meant to discourage him, and Satan's words telling Christ the burden is to heavy for a man to carry. (In Luke, it is mentioned that Jesus is so distraught during this time that an angel from heaven appears to console him, but it appears that starting with this first scene, Gibson's film would be a combination of the Gospels, not obedient to one Gospel, but to all of them.)Gibson is very articulate with every second that goes by. The characters are so conflicted and confused during such a catastrophic event that their sufferings are intense in their moments of remorse (i.e., Judas, Peter, Pilate). Gibson&#65533;s imagination supplements well with what Scripture has to offer, as at some points the Gospels are rather lacking in detail. I also especially enjoyed the Aramaic, Greek, and Latin. It indeed added to the realism of the story, something that is immensely lacking in any other Jesus film.Before viewing this film, I would say it would be wise to review the Gospels. It is only those who are familiar with Scripture who will come to realize how beautifully Gibson brings Christ&#65533;s story to life, and how he succeeds in doing so without any assumption (especially with the characters &#65533; Pontius Pilate being a sympathetic, conflicted character is NOT a myth, it is Biblical; the high priests being inhumane and blood thirsty, also Biblical).The aftermath of the release of such a film will be interesting. I will not be surprised if a comparison between this and The Exorcist will be brought to light, which should be a delight. Both films are directed by men of great faith, whose intentions include expressing their love for religion, the intensity of what is inside their hearts, and also to shock, frighten, and inspire people back into their faith.I will enjoy The Passion of the Christ again and again.",5,breathtaking and accurate....much respect to Gibson.,1078704000,"03 8, 2004",0.2559

A lot of the dialogue and events in the film just didn't come out of the Bible as I remembered, so I went and reread. And I must say, I think Gibson definitely added a lot of substance to this movie, at the obvious risk of losing to accuracy. But I think it was probably needed, as the story (as related by Matthew Mark and Luke) doesn't have the amount of detail to make a good movie.The gore and violence were over the top. As one reviewer here has already stated, losing that amount of blood during a scourging would leave a person unable to stand, much less carry a heavy cross the way Jesus was shown to do. Also, running nails through hands and feet would definitely NOT lead to blood draining out, as shown in this film. As Gibson pounds nails though the hands and cross, blood is seen running out and pouring onto the ground. This is completely fictional, unless the nails were hollowed out with blood grooves, as anybody who is experienced with this sort of thing knows. The object piercing the body seals off the skin around it, and typically you have a bloodless wound with this type of piercing.I think Gibson's vision of Satan (another addition by Gibson to the story) was drawn from modern horror films. The black-hooded, menacing figure with bugs crawling though his body just seems so Stephen King. I am reminded of the Bible's own depiction of Satan as masquerading as an angel of light 2Co 10:15, which would make Satan a beautiful creature to see.As a movie with a vision of the suffering of Christ, this certainly holds its own and is doubtful ever to be replaced. This movie is shocking and mesmerizing, as was its intent. But please, no more about accuracy and drawn straight from the scriptures.

Things like the scenes with Satan chatting with Jesus, the table and chair scene with Mary, the overflogging of Christ, the quick jump to an odd resurrrection scene, are simply Mel's version of what he believes happened. I did not come away with any sense of salvation or Christ's teachings and purpose on Earth, but rather with a sad feeling that most people who rave about this movie have never read the Bible, nor have any grounding in history or theology, but will still take this as the Gospel truth, which it is not.

A joke is floating around currently, suggesting that the DVD of this movie will come complete with a bonus disc of Christ being beaten up by Jews for an additional 78 minutes.The role of the Jews - a very controversial topic indeed - is handled 'as it is written', to steal the phrase, in the New Testament. However, research shows that Jews didn't really have all that much say in those days and lived in what could be termed, in modern venacular, a police state. Though they were not treated as badly as in 1940s Europe, they certainly had comparable rights (or lack thereof). To say that Jews killed Christ is akin to suggesting Jews had the deciding vote in Germany invading France.

Gibson and the people who were strongly affected by this film are devout Christians so to them it must feel like some kind of personal moving experience. I simply watched it as a film. Its a good movie, with good actors and it looks very realistic. However there are some hard to believe parts in here that make the film a bit of a farce. First off, why is there a bald guy in a black cloak as Satan even seen in the film? His appearance is very cartoonish in my opinion, not seeing Satan on screen would've made me take the movie a lot more seriously. Even so, the film is simply Brutal! Jesus is brought before Pilate and the first time he tells his soldiers just to beat Jesus up. But the Romans are very Sadistic! 3 burly bald toothless Romans grab switches and whips and they beat Jesus for what feels like an eternity. He's reduced to a bloody mound of meat. The detail is disgustingly REAL. As if that weren't enough he's crowned with his crown of thorns and presented before the crowd of Jews. The rabbis still not satisfied want Jesus crucified. I can see why present-day Jews get angry at this depiction, because its made quite obvious that it was the Jews not the Romans who killed Jesus. Pilate didn't even want him punished, but the rabbis insisted. The crucifixion scene is of course agonizing. Once again the details are a sadists' delight.

Despite all the rhetoric involved in the release, the promotion and the hype it clearly sends a message to humanity.....to suffer for your fellow man is the ultimate sacrifice but it will lead to the greatest of honor.This extraordinary film is the re-enactment of the passion as explained in the four books of the Gospel. It helps to read these books prior to the film if you are not familiar with the story or if you want to be able to compare and contrast Gibson's idea to the truth as told within the Bible. Most of the film is very dark but brings to light historical figures that lived in a time of horrible brutality. If crimes were punished in a similar way today I doubt we would have many criminals! Christ knows his direction in life and has willingly accepted his own death in order to save the sins of humanity. Whether or not you believe the religious theory behind this sacrifice the story represents what all humans should be willing to do for the life of another. This movie is absolutely brutal and so graphic that the faint at heart will have to turn away, but don't, the least we can do for this historical figure is watch a movie that depicts His suffering. As for the anti-Semitism that was so widely touted I didn't see it. To be honest with you I felt angrier at the Romans for the relentless beating they gave to Christ. But it isn't a class, gender or race issue that is involved in this story it is about humanity as a whole and how we resort to violence instead of acceptance towards the things we don't understand. All creeds, religions and sects have authorized brutal killings for the sake of their faith so no one is more able to wipe their hands of Christ's death than any other.James Caviezel plays the part of Jesus Christ with such perfection you will feel as though you have been transported back in time and are actually meeting the image of the man Himself. This role required a great deal from Caviezel, demanding endurance and exhibiting compassion without going overboard as so many other actors have done in the past. The film is spoken in Aramaic and Latin (with sub-titles) and Caviezel is flawless in his accent bringing even more depth to his portrayal. By the end of this movie the only thing that can move on Caviezel is his eyes and in those last subtle shifts of movement his acting becomes something phenomenal. Beside Caviezel in her role as Mary Magdalene is Monica Bellucci whose loyalty and soft determination follows Christ to His grave along with Mother Mary (played by Maia Morgenstern). The women are the strength of this film just as I imagine them to have been in real life although they were ostracized by the men who wrote the Bible. Rosalinda Celentano is the ever present Satan that horrible evil that lurks in every nook and cranny of this film and she is downright scary. Caiphas is presented as a vindictive man and is played nicely by Mattia Sbragia. Close to Caviezel in excellence is Hristo Shopov cast as the powerful but weak Pontius Pilate. The truly amazing thing is that none of the actors in this film are really stars but they all succeed in their roles with a grace and spirit that stands above the fluff and muster of Hollywood.Mel Gibson has done something here that surpasses bravery, he has taken a highly controversial subject (religion and faith), stayed very close to the story as told in the Gospels and dared to put his own funding up to support it, so is he crazy or was he driven to bring a taste of faith back into a hollow humanity. Not only is this film beautiful to watch but it is as accurate a story as can be told based upon historical and religious records. The music is haunting and magical. The use of foreign language a feat in its own right for American audiences who would rather eat popcorn than read subtitles. But Gibson's real gift is how he manages to inspire something in people who see this film, it may be tears, compassion, renewed faith, anger, spite or indifference but at least it stirs up something in a massive audience of people who all too often don't have to feel anything while watching a film.

But what about some of the stuff before that? Fortunately, there are multiple flashbacks so that it can cover a little more ground.The movie begins with haunting music together with dark and cool color themes (color themes are used often in the movie). At night, a bright blue moon with thick layers of mist on the dark garden, appropriately matching the given scene of Gethsemane. With all the dialogue in Hebrew, Aramaic and Latin (don't worry; there are English subtitles) and the ethereal music, there is an intensely artistically feel throughout the movie, to the extent it is somewhat difficult for one to enjoy or dislike the movie in any conventional sense. Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing the film, on par with his Oscar winning movie Braveheart. Gibson, I think, has earned at least a nomination with this film.The depth of the character of Jesus is developed more fully than most movies on the life of Christ and greatly emphasizes his humanity. Here we see Jesus not just a stoic and solemn teacher, but also facets of definite fear and reluctance in the sacrifice he is called to make for humanity, and not wanting the other disciples (only three were with him at the scene at Gethsemane) to see him like this. Flashbacks later show him in lighthearted moods of cheerfulness and even playfulness. Jesus really does come across as very human character, even though the divine aspect is not neglected in the film.What about historical accuracy? I'll mention a few points here. Pontius Pilate is plausibly portrayed. If he does not execute Jesus, he fears a rebellion from Caiphas. But if he does execute Jesus, he fears that Jesus' followers may start a rebellion. Either way, he fears that we will get in trouble with Caesar (a rebellion would not make Pilate look in control of the region) and thus tries to walk a tightrope somewhere in between. This is reasonable since in 31 C.E. Pilate's protector/patron Sejanus fell from power because he was plotting against the emperor. This would have made Pilate's position very weak in 33 C.E. (the date Jesus was probably crucified), so it's quite reasonable that he would have been unusually careful to prevent getting into further trouble with Caesar. The crucifixion however is less realistic however. Jesus would most likely have been nailed at the wrists, not in the palms as we see in some traditional paintings.For those of you wanting their kids to see this movie, I should remind you that it is rated R for a very good reason. The violence is brutally realistic when Jesus is scourged. When it's all done, there appear to be hundreds of bloody lacerations all over his body. And on top of this there is of course the crown of thorns and being nailed to the cross.I would be remiss in my review if I did not say something about the anti-Semitism that supposedly exists in this film. There are a couple of problems with this charge. One, it was by far the Roman gentiles-not the Jews-who were the most vicious, sardonic and sadistic people in the movie.Second there is the crucial question: were the Jews portrayed in a negative light? An oversimplified yes would hardly do the matter justice. Yes, some Jews were-but many were not. By mentioning only the instances of a negative portrayal of Jews, some critics make the movie seem a lot more one-sided than it really is.So what are the favorable portrayals of Jews? There is of course the fact that the protagonist and his most loyal followers were Jewish (a fact often overlooked by Anti-Semites who call themselves Christians). The Jewishness of the women followers was particularly emphasized with some brief Passover dialogue. Additionally, Mel Gibson went out of his way (included material not in the gospels) to show that these Jewish enemies of Jesus were not representative of all Jews. For instance, the movie showed a dissenting member of the Sanhedrin. Who called the meeting anyway? And at this hour of the night? Where are the other members of the council? As the crowd pushed him out of the meeting, the Jewish priest denounced the whole meeting as a beastly travesty! Furthermore, the movie made it most explicitly clear that Simon of Cyrene was a Jew, and he was ultimately seen as a compassionate man, very sympathetic towards the suffering of Jesus. This Jewish man who was not a follower of Jesus was actually more virtuous than any of the gentiles in the movie.Any unfavorable aspects of the DVD? Unfortunately, yes. Probably the most disappointing aspect of this DVD is the complete lack of any special features.

On the contrary, it was the Jewish LEADERS that killed Christ, as it was the German LEADERS that killed the Jews - and both out of envy. If Christ had been born in Ireland or some other country, it would have been their leaders that killed Him. WHO killed Christ is unimportant.What is important is WHY Christ died. He wasn't murdered - He gave up His own life willingly as part of God's plan for saving His people from their sins. If you watch The Passion and all you see is brutality, blood and death, you're missing the point. The point is, without Christ's sacrifice, we would all die in our sins and spend the rest of eternity separated from God, because none of us is good enough to save himself. But God, out of love, took on Himself our sins in the person of Christ. We were the ones scheduled to be brutally beaten and die on that cross; but God, out of love, took the punishment for us and died in our place. He did what we couldn't do for ourselves. And then He did one more thing: He raised Himself from the dead, proving for all time that He indeed was God; and showing that, one day, we, too, would rise again.The Passion Of The Christ shows the sacrifice that Christ made for us, which only love could have compelled Him to do. The brutality only underscores His love. If you don't watch The Passion and see the love behind it, you're missing the point; and, possibly, missing the boat as far as what Christ came to bring.Christ was born to die. He wasn't born to teach, heal or show the way: He IS the Way. He was born to die - not pointlessly, but purposefully, so that we could live. THAT's what The Passion is all about: not brutality, blood and death; but love, sacrifice and life. If you see that when you watch this movie, it's only because God has given you the eyes to see it, as well as the gift to share in what Christ came to bring.Waitsel Smith",5,"A PRODUCT OF LOVE, SKILL AND MARKETING GENIUS",1137110400,"01 13, 2006",-0.1606

There were flaws; most films during the year often have them. But I must say, although I understand where most were coming from when hating this film, I'm still quite shocked there were so many that accused director Mel Gibson of producing an &quot;artistic failure&quot; or a movie full of anti-semitism. Read what Roger Ebert wrote here, and you'll see why I didn't throw similar accusations at Gibson or his film.&quot;A reasonable person, I believe, will reflect that in this story set in a Jewish land, there are many characters with many motives, some good, some not, each one representing himself, none representing his religion. The story involves a Jew who tried no less than to replace the established religion and set himself up as the Messiah. He was understandably greeted with a jaundiced eye by the Jewish establishment while at the same time finding his support, his disciples and the founders of his church entirely among his fellow Jews. The libel that the Jews &quot;killed Christ&quot; involves a willful misreading of testament and teaching: Jesus was made man and came to Earth in order to suffer and die in reparation for our sins. No race, no man, no priest, no governor, no executioner killed Jesus; he died by God's will to fulfill his purpose, and with our sins we all killed him. That some Christian churches have historically been guilty of the sin of anti-Semitism is undeniable, but in committing it they violated their own beliefs.&quot;I agree that Christians believe Christ died because it was part of God's plan. And according to the Bible, the Jews were not responsible, nor were the Romans: it was the collective sin in the world in past, present and future. It says it in the Bible, and that's what most, if not all, Christians believe. If a Christian were to hate someone of Hebrew descent or of the Jewish religion, they would be, like Ebert said, violating their own belief system.Despite some wonderful cinematic aspects of the film, great acting and obvious emotional power, I truly believe Gibson failed in attempting to make 'The Passion' universal. Sometimes, there was a bit too much violence. I really wished he hadn't focused on the beating as much as the beautifully filmed flashbacks, which could have given people who were unfamiliar with the subject matter a better understanding of why there was a purpose for this violence, and why there was so much of it, and why Jesus was so fiercely accused of blasphomy, the politics, etc. It would have continued to illuminate His influence on His people and family, as well.Although the violence is disappointingly distracting from the overall messege, I do not hesitate to call it a work of art; technically, it is perfect. Also, a film that caused as much conversation about world issues as it did, well, it can't be thrown away as a failure or unimportant, in my eyes. It was not pornographic, either. Its violence served a purpose, and I think Gibson followed through with what he was trying to convey with what I think is one of the better films of the year. I was nearly brought to tears countless times. This is not to be missed. You may hate it, you may be on the fence, or you may love it, but there is no doubt that this is the most unavoidably visceral work in cinema since Lars von Trier's 'Dancer in the Dark.'",4,One of the stronger films of the year.,1091577600,"08 4, 2004",-0.1693

Also the dropping of Jesus off a bridge was funny.One last thing I'd like to point out is the terrible scourging of Jesus.

Mel Gibson's whole career and success in life is based on violence in the cinema, from Mad Max to Braveheart, so it's not surprising that when searching for another film to direct he chose a most violent thing; a crucifixion. But shockingly, this is violence that strikes at the heart of a faith.Violence is not the faith. The faith is about a celebration of life; in the teachings of a living prophet (or living God, as the Christians called him) who gave us intelligent words of wisdom, peace, hope for all and self worth as living, spiritual beings.For me, The Passion of Christ misses the point of spirituality. I simply fell into the emotion of feeling sorry for this good man being beaten to a pulp and humiliated before us. As this film is from Jesus' point-of-view, there could have been some truly intimate scenes between him and his God, which would have completed the experience and made this a better film.What Mr. Gibson has made here is an audience attracting, sensationalist film. A spectacle of blood filled with gore and gratuitous violence. What it lacks is sensitivity and nuance. In film nothing is real, it is all made up with 110 page scripts, actors in make-up, cameras, backdrops with painted studio floors and fake blood. It is totally the subjective opinion of the filmmaker no matter how artificial or real it seems, and the audience is entirely at the whim of that filmmaker. I was left with the feeling of being manipulated by a disturbed filmmaker.This is an exploitation film shamelessly praying on the hearts and minds of the followers of a faith, with a distorted touch of scary film shock to sell tickets and reap the currency of the faithful, the curious and the perverse who enjoy violence. This is like turning the sanctity of the faithful into a World Wrestling Federation Circus.To me, Mr. Gibson hasn't yet risen to the challenge of being a storyteller. But unfortunately, he garners the attendance at this movie because it is masquerading as a biblical epic made by a matinee idol.Great photography of Filmmaker/Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel. Wonderful emotional music of John Debney. Fine editing of John Wright and production design of Francesco Frigeri. Great acting of Jim Caviezel. All together a great cast and crew members who made this film for Mr. Gibson.One thing this film did for me was to make me think, think about all the atrocities that man has done to fellow man throughout the ages in the name of Jesus Christ by the very people who preach his words. Fortunately for us, the good message seeps through and survives. Jesus' life was neither about death, torture nor tyranny, but about the simple celebration of spiritual love, growth, life and how to get along with our fellow human beings.

And Mel Gibson takes the final 12 hours of that amazing story, that amazing life, and puts it under a cinematic microscope the likes of which Christians have never known. The Passion is a well made, well directed and well acted film. It is sure to rank among the best ever made in the genre. But it does have its problems.First, I couldn't help but feel that Gibson was leaning too heavily on traditional and/or personal teachings and understandings of certain aspects of this story rather than on the scriptures themselves. He seems to go above and beyond the scriptures in many cases, and not just to preserve a sense of realism or artistic vision.For example, as in many films on the life of Christ, his mother Mary is given a spotlight almost as large as the Lord's. In scripture, Mary certainly is there, but she is never as central to the Gospels as, say, Peter.Secondly, I have a hard time believing the Romans beat Christ as many times as they did. There is no evidence in the scriptures to suggest that Christ was beat to a higher degree than any other criminal being prepared for crucifixion. This is the scene that I believe that many point to as being over-the-top and violent for violence sake. I can't help but agree. Forty lashes was the usual punishment (I think) and yet we get almost double that here.Then there is the scene when Jesus is brought before Herod and he asks Jesus to perform a miracle for him. Why is Herod being portrayed as some sort of flamboyant cream puff? Maybe historical documents prove otherwise but in all my studies of the scriptures I have never heard that.Next are the historical inaccuracies. The Romans would have spoken Greek not Latin. Crucifixion was in the wrists not the hands (the hands were not strong enough to hold the body in place).Other non Biblical scenes include Jesus hanging from chains over a bridge by his Roman tormentors and also being flipped over face down with the cross crushing him against the ground as they secure the nails to the beams. All the while, blood is everywhere, flying, dripping, seeping.As for the package itself, I was really hoping for extras, but you get nothing at all. This was a real disappointment, as I always enjoy those sorts of things with DVDs.On the bright side, however, as was alluded to before, the acting is great, especially the performance of Jim Caviezel as Jesus. Never before has a more believable Christ been committed to film.Don't think that I totally dislike this film. It is a good film. But I think Gibson may have allowed many of his own passions and personal beliefs to color the telling of the story.

Telling the story of Jesus' last 12 hours, from the Gardens of Gesthamane to his blink of an eye ressurection, this movie imbeds the message of Christianity as powerfully as the nails that punctured Christ. By the end of the movie, almost everybody was in tears and was moved beyond comparison. My own father had to Depressure for about an hour to get all the sadness of this movie out of his system. I praise Mel Gibson for never giving up for what he believed in or caving in to controversy, because this is the most vivid and accurate account of The Last 12 Hours of Christ that has been potrayed to this day.Acting: The acting throughout this movie is top-notch even though it was cast in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew, so you have to rely on English subtitles to translate the words. The acting is dark, and the actors voices make your heart beat faster every time they talk. Jim Caviezel is the perfect choice for Jesus, as his voice seems to stand out from all the others, but towards the end he just grunts and doesn't do all that much, but thats forgiveable. The standout in acting in my opinion came from Maia Morgenstern, who plays the brooding and grief-stricken Mary, who follows Jesus on his path to the cross and is by him until he utters his last words to her. Monica Belluci and whoever plays James play great supporting roles and really added to the movie. Also I love how the Devil follows Jesus to the cross and the scene where she is holding the Anti-Christ is one of the most memorable.Directing: Mel Gibson does an absolutely excellent job directing,as he pours his heart out into this movie. The way he casts a gloomy atmosphere over the movie will make most critics swoon. I loved the camera work(Especially the slow-mo shots) and I thought that I really was in Jerusalem 2000 years ago with the vivid images that you see. Excellent! Mel Gibson will probably get at LEAST nominated for an Academy Award by the end of this year.Bottom Line: This is an epic motion picture that should be seen by all Christians and anybody trying to get into the religion. Do not listen to the liberals who call this movie Anti-Semitic, it just potrays what is written in the Gospels. I would not recommend this to anyone under 8, as I think most kids over that age could handle the gore(They might even learn a little latin)Footnotes: This movie has a great score and I recommend the sountrack that was realeased at the time of the movie.

But, since I enjoyed Apocalypto in spite of its problems (which any film painting on such a large canvas is likely to have), I finally decided to watch this much-hyped film. I was appalled.The story of the Passion is relatively brief, but powerful, whether or not you accept its literal truth. This film reduced its potency to an orgy of sado-masochistic exhibitionism with anti-Semitic embellishments. Jews are depicted as a faceless, howling mob lusting for sacred blood, some going so far to visit the site of the execution to gloat like comic-opera villains, something Jews of the time would have never done, places of execution being ritually unclean. Further, the Satan of the Gesthemane scene was equally problematic, a malevolent, androgyne cross between Klaus Nomi and Udo Kier. Gibson clearly sets his fey and urbane devil against the muscular Christ in what I thought was yet another Gibson indulgence of the tired, emasculated homosexual evil construct. Never mind that Satan, in the actual Passion story, never puts in an appearance. And these are fairly representative problems in what is, essentially, a two-hour long snuff film where the Sermon on the Mount is reduced to one line, swallowed up by loving, gratuitous shots of Roman punishments and execution methods. Indeed, if the movie has any value, it lies in a faithful reproduction of how Romans treated people who ran afoul of their rule. But as is, it takes the clear prejudices of the film-maker, slathers them with gore, and lays them on the flayed back of the unimpressive Jim Caveziel who - I hope - was very well paid for his efforts, at least.If this is a subject that interests you, I would recommend The Greatest Story Ever Told. True, it is very long and can get very dry, but at least it tries to be as comprehensive as the historical record allows, and you actually hear the words of Christ as opposed to his shrieks. But the only Passion in this film has less to do with Christ than the turgid, dripping, dark obssessions of its maker.No recommendation.",1,The Abattoir of the Christ,1279670400,"07 21, 2010",0.1422

The film, laced with modern sensibilities and Catholic mystic dogma, allowed the viewers to meditate on the suffering by Jesus for the propitiation of our sins. Although, the film&#8217;s delivery is obviously a product of the 21 century, the socio-political milieus of these events are quite accurately portrayed.From the gospel record of Jesus&#8217; trial before the Sanhedrin we find that Mel Gibson was accurate in showing the contradictory nature of the accusing witnesses. This seems to be by far the most accurate scene in the film. The desire of the council was to produce witnesses who would give testimony with enough evidence to condemn Jesus to death. However, the witnesses produced contradictory testimony. (Stein, 1996) As in the film, the evidence did not come forth through the witnesses but by Jesus Himself, when Jesus answered Caiaphas in the affirmative about being the Son of God, the Messiah.The film&#8217;s portrayal of Herod is very reminiscent of John Belushi&#8217;s role in the movie Animal House. Herod is portrayed in a frat boy manner obsessed with seeing a stage show of miracles. Herod made a joke out of his examination of Jesus through mockery. (Summers, 1965) Yet, it would be interesting to know if Herod was truly the clown portrayed in the film. Herod was not interested in the claims of Jesus or His message. Herod wanted to see the miracle worker in action. It is obvious that Herod was not up to the task of an actual serious examination of Jesus or of truly considering the charges being sworn against Him. Herod did not appear interested in anything other than a stage show performed by the famous miracle worker. Herod did not find fault in Jesus. Yet, he did not seriously consider Him either. He is an example of many who have missed out on the truly important things in life by focusing on the temporal.Mel Gibson&#8217;s film portrayed Pilate as a cowardly individual who feared the outcome of a possible rebellion. Pilate in the film tries to find a way to free Jesus from execution but in the end gives in to the Jewish crowd. The gospel records are in line with the depiction of the film. Pilate saw no wrong in Jesus, certainly not anything worthy of death. Yet, with the crowd in such an excited state, calling for Jesus&#8217; death, Pilate certainly was boxed in a corner. It is possible as depicted in the film that Cesar would have moved against Pilate in the case of a rebellion. Pilate&#8217;s principles of justice then gave away to self-preservation.The film The Passion of the Christ portrayed accurately the socio-political milieu surrounding the trial and death of Jesus the Messiah. It portrayed the Jewish leaders grasping at anything to condemn Jesus to death. It depicted the none seriousness of Herod when Jesus was brought before him for inspection, and it accurately showed Pilate as a man more concerned with quelling a mob than pursuing true justice.",4,The Passion of The Christ,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",0.0127

The pacing is pitch perfect, and the acting is spot on and enthralling. The Passion of the Christ does not contain a single hokey scene in which I questioned the actor's ability. Instead, the story is immersive. Regardless of how you feel about world religions, see the movie and enjoy it as a well acted and directed story.There are so many bad Hollywood products being turned out that if you want a well made film, please consider the Passion of the Christ. If you rent it merely looking to strengthen your polemic, well...can't help you there. I have enjoyed almost every recent project that Mel Gibson has been involved with.

It's too bad, because the picture it gives is deeply rooted in history - unless, of course, you believe that the New Testament accounts are fairy tales with no basis in history. If so, you may have no interest. But the dramatic power of the story and the historical accuracy with which it is presented have a power of their own, no matter what you believe.It is interesting that this movie was attacked for its anti-Semitism. To a person with no axe to grind either way, it would seem that if Jesus was NOT the Messiah, then indeed he was a blasphemer and a troublemaker par excellence, and the Jewish hierarchy were doing the right thing to get rid of him. If he was the Messiah, then this same hierarchy was playing a dangerous game, and the earthquakes and general destruction that followed his death were a sign that perhaps his kingdom truly was not of this world...and not a rational thing, either.The hierarchs who fuel the cry for his crucifixion are above all rational men, who see where their power lies, and know how to maintain it. There are several of the hierarchy who disagree, but they are shouted down. All along, there are those on both sides (Romans and Jews) whose hearts are moved, and who are horrified by the brutality of what happens. So it certainly cannot be said that the Jews en masse are to be blamed, as was wrongly said by many ignorant people in the Church during medieval times and later, who used this as an excuse to persecute Jesus' people.If Jesus said, Father, forgive them, they know not what they do, then it is indeed the Christians who have failed to follow Jesus' example. The true guilt lies here. Each of us during Holy Week should watch this movie and see what the results of lack of forgiveness are. Teachings of forgiveness and mercy are not unique to the New Testament, they are there in the Torah/Pentateuch if one's eyes are open. The Jewish people who went like lambs to the slaughter of the Holocaust are heirs of Jesus, even if they did not believe in his identity as the Messiah. And we Christians have been in the shoes of the Romans who drove in the nails.If hearts are open to it, this movie could bring much peace to the world. Peace is never brought by ignoring violence but by confronting, even, if necessary, submitting to it, and forgiving it - which is the only thing, ultimately, that touches men's hearts.",5,"Father, forgive us...",1270166400,"04 2, 2010",-0.1135

Mel Gibson's vision could be viewed as extreme and in some cases unwatchable. The debate(s) in the film are endless as Christianity stresses that Jesus Christ suffered for our sins. However, was his suffering this extreme? Only the people who who were present could only know. Yet, if one studied the brutality of the Romans as they put on feats of carnage at the Coliseum, one could argue that the same brutality was shed at crucifixions (pre and during). The other debate is the question of anti-semitism. No! this film does not promote anti-semitism. However, it was the Jewish Rabbis and clergymen who forced the Romans and egged-on their 'people' to have Jesus Christ killed because they felt threatened. Lastly, the success of the film is probably due to the timing of its release. Every once in a while, a reaffirmation of faith is needed by the population and perhaps a serious religious film such as 'THE PASSION...' was needed. There hasn't been a major release of this type of film in a while and with a slew of recent films concerning the supernatural, demonic, and witchcraft etc. Mel Gibson grabbed his opportunity and the film took on a life of its own. Because of this film, it is now reported that the Bible is being looked at as a new source of ideas for films (Are there Bible related or religious comic books out there?). The entertainment value of the film is dabatable but it is provoking and it does, to a degree, reaffirm one's faith and to remind one what Christianity is all about.",4,The Passion of Mel Gibson,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",0.032

That all changes with The Passion of the Christ.I don't want to get into the nit-picking of this film, as in all honesty I do not have a strong scriptural grasp on all the passages that director Mel Gibson tries to portray, but instead I view it from just one perspective: Beginning with the night that Jesus was taken into Roman custody until the stone was rolled away from the tomb, this film is a very visceral interpretation of one possible scenario that may have played out. It is sort of like a historical-fiction telling of the crucifixion story, as no one knows exactly what transpired.From a plot perspective, the film doesn't at all delve into the meaning of Jesus' crucifixion (to save the world from their sins so we can join him in heaven someday), but takes a just the facts, m'am approach to the story. Jesus is captured by the Romans, tried by King Herod and Pontius Pilate, beaten mercilessly and humiliated, and then crucified...the end. The violent acts committed during these scenes are startling, to say the least, yet they do shed light on how difficult a process this was for Jesus to endure, as (at the time) he was confined to a mortal body and bound by its limitations.Thus, if you are at all squeamish about bloody violence, steer clear of this film at all costs.

While I will not rate this movie based on it's obviously Catholic outlook of faith and salvation through suffering, it does need to be said that it is significant in this film.The most disturbing thing to me about Gibson's interpretation is how liberally and freely Gibson filled in a movie supposedly based on the Gospels with many, many details from The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ by Anne Catherine Emmerich. Emmerich was a Catholic nun and stigmatist in the late 18th and early 19th Century who claimed to have had visions of the last 12 hours of Christ's life and wrote them in a book. The entire text of this can be easily found by doing a search on-line and reading it was very revealing to me. Gibson took MANY details that weren't in the Gospels and filled them in with Emmerich's visions. The problem with this being that many of her visions were historically inaccurate. The most glaring example is the flogging and chastising scene, where Jesus is whipped and flailed what seems like upwards of 70 or 80 times. The Romans were often cruel and unusual torturers, but they were also very calculated and specific, and this is completely out of line with their practices (which were 40 minus 1 lashes). This exact scenario, down to the weapons used and the look and state of the guards at hand are taken directly out of Emmerich's book. Gibson claimed before the movie that he was inspired by her visions, but took little detail from them. This is blatantly inaccurate, and in reading it, I saw more of her book in the movie than I saw the Gospels. I understand that purely using the Gospels would've resulted in a movie that may have pushed an hour in length, but the danger lies in believing that everything in this movie is truth, theologically or historically, and that is often far from correct.On a more technical level, I did like the casting of the apostles, especially Peter, but I did feel like Christ should've been cast a bit more Jewish as he looked a bit too Euro and out of place compared to most of the supporting cast. It also seemed to me that Christ was willingly going to the Cross out of duty rather than out of love, both from his expressions and his manner of speaking. While Christ had His moments of doubt and weakness leading up to his crucifixion, it was always about His love for the human race and I felt like this was often lost.If this movie helps to bolster your faith, then more power to you. I would also suggest reading the on-line text of Emmerich's book and re-reading the Gospels to truly separate fact from fiction and not accidentally mixing the two out of ignorance. Also, anyone looking to use this a conversion tool best look elsewhere. The release of the movie did get people talking about Christ, which is good, but Gibson is primarily preaching to the choir here. That is a better starting point than forcing your non-believing friends to watch this.",3,Stars for Gibson's convictions but...,1093392000,"08 25, 2004",0.2818
957,A3ADK3ZTJ87915,310263662,Zinta Aistars Writer & Editor,"[8, 10]","At last, we could get tickets. The astoundingly popular new movie in theatres nationwide at the time of this writing, The Passion of The Christ as directed by Mel Gibson, had sold out in my Midwest town on the first weekend of its showing. While admittedly feeling just a little anxious about seeing onscreen the brutality of a realistic crucifixion-I had heard so much about this aspect of it, and I otherwise avoid movies promoted as violent-I was increasingly eager to see with my own eyes, judge with my own mind, what I was hearing discussed so heatedly everywhere I turned. With record breaking sales, the movie was bringing in unprecedented crowds.I had read and viewed countless interviews and reviews and op-eds about Gibson's portrayal of Christ's crucifixion, heard the talk around the water cooler at the office, shared the insights over dinner with friends, debated the message sent to viewers over a cold one at the pub.And then: the theatre lights dim.The opening scene is blue with moonlight. The shadow of a man in a garden, silhouettes of trees surrounding him, the soft breathing of sleepers nearby. We hear the whisper of anguished prayer, the kind we pray when our hearts are raw with terror and loneliness. Christ prays, alone, to his Father, while his disciples sleep, and for a moment he is more son of man than Son of God, for he feels as we feel, and the sweat runs down his face, lit by the moon, as he trembles with premonition. A silent figure with haunting eyes glimpses between the silhouetted trees, watching, listening. Satan is played by a female figure, male voice dubbed over, androgynous and as oddly seductive in its manner as any evil. This silent figure is always near.It is some time into the movie before I feel the first hot flush of tears wash over my eyes. Perhaps I have been prepared by all the talk. Perhaps I know the story well enough. There are no surprises. If my breathing strains at the merciless scourging, I do not, will not, look away. How can I? It is my hand that holds the whip. It is I who have dealt the punishment. It is I who nevertheless receive the reward of mercy and forgiveness. And so I bear witness.The moment that breaks me down and pushes me over is one that taps into my mother's heart. I watch as Mary's face pales with pain. I watch as she struggles through the crowd massed around to see her son carry His cross, even as the soldiers continue to beat Him. She can do nothing, nothing to stop them, nothing to stop what must be, what her son Himself has accepted fully as the cup that is His to drink. She can, however, let Him see her among that crazed and maddened crowd, let His eyes meet hers for an instant, offering the support of her mother's heart through eyes alone. When her son falls to His knees beneath the terrible weight He carries, Mary recalls instantly the little boy fallen in the dust of the road that runs along their house and how she rushes to Him, embracing him, soothing away His pain. This time, she can't save Him, nor even hold Him, but her eyes send her love to Him across the crowd, and He is strengthened by it.As witness of this scene, one that resonates in me so deeply that I grow dizzy with the pain of empathy and understanding, I allow my own tears to flow freely. I am broken and healed simultaneously.We all know how the story ends. Or, at least, where it ends when the last page of the Book is turned. Beyond that it is continued individually in our own lives and through our own daily choices and decisions, as lifelong witnesses to the sacrifice made for each and every one of us.Having held back from all the vapid discussions around water coolers and in neighborhood pubs previously, I'm glad now I can offer my own perspective. And that is: Gibson has courageously created a masterpiece. I would change nothing. I know the story so well, as many of us do, yet seeing it on screen so vividly left a powerful effect that haunts me still, days after seeing it, and perhaps lifelong. The entire movie is an invitation to explore one's heart, one's conscience, one's spirituality, one's life. It is a movie that changes lives.And is the violence gratuitous? I have heard so much about this-the violence of Christ's crucifixion. And I am offended by the accusation. How can our society be so hypocritical? In a time when we allow pornography on every venue, referring to this abuse of human rights and dignity as freedom of expression, when we allow our children to play video games that glamorize murder, when every other movie on the screen today makes a sport of killing and torment, when child abuse has become rampant, and war rages across the planet.... we dare call a movie that realistically portrays the suffering one man, Son of God, endures for each and every one of us ... too violent? How dare we. I suspect it is our shame of the hammer and nail we each hold in our own hands that allows such rationalization.I highly recommend this movie.
