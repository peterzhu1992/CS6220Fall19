Griffin aegriffin,"[9, 10]","This was one of the best programs ever to be broadcast on either public television (which is saying a great deal given other legendary programs like I'Claudius, Poldark, and Upstairs, Downstairs) or the networks. The story centers on the return of a brash young surgeon from London to his native Manchester to tend his alcoholic father. In connection with his return he joins the staff of a local hospital and shortly thereafter falls in love with an older woman he met on the trip from London. (...) Reckless offers everything a discerning viewer could want: romance, drama, comedy, suspense, and even farce. Casting is ideal all roles are admirably played by skilled actors who understand precisely who their characters are and what they should be doing/feeling at every given moment.

It's an intelligent and witty romantic comedy. Well written, well acted, well designed. I certainly enviedFrancesca Annis being fought over by two such extraordinarily appealing leading men. I bet if anyone asked her,she would remember this film series as being one of the highlights of her acting career. I only wish that bothRobson Green and Michael Kitchen had been given more opportunities to show this side of their talent.Great fun.",5,A Great Romp!,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",0.5054

Francesca Annis's same-age doctor husband takes a young woman to his medical conference and the young doctor who works for him makes sure his wife finds out. This is because the younger man wants his supervisor's wife for himself. Naturally, the wife has to get even with her husband and after all the young man is THERE....and so we go. It's compelling viewing as all of their lives come blasting apart.

All of the actors are wonderful, displaying perfect comic timing. The dramatic scenes are often poignant.The love story may be central to the plot, but the adventures of Anna and Owen touch the lives of their relatives, friends and business associates in unexpected ways. The settings range from city, to lush countryside to a working man's neighborhood and pub, to a bustling hospital.

7,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,076400235X,Hikari,"[6, 6]","Fans like me who were first introduced to Robson Green as the intellectual and quite asexual Dr. Tony Hill on Wire in the Blood are in for a treat. In Reckless, a much younger Mr. Green plays another doctor with a much warmer, more open and comedic attitude that's probably closer to the actor as he is in personal life. Reminiscent at times of a young Mel Gibson, the impetuous and barely bridled sexual charisma that percolates under the surface of Tony Hill is let out in full display in Owen Springer, and we are powerless to resist. I can't imagine too many men will cop to liking this movie, unless they are gay. It unabashedly plays to female fantasies--how many gorgeous young men would actually stand in a pouring rain and say I think I'm in love with you? A completely unrealistic scenario, perhaps, but one guaranteed to leave a woman weak in the knees, especially delivered with such blue-eyed sincerity as Mr. Green musters. The plot revolves around marital infidelity and not even the luscious Mr. Green can make that palatable, but we are willing to put aside our distaste because that blue gaze is hypnotic. I haven't even seen the second half yet, but I imagine that even more of Mr. Green's juicy posterior will be on offer. I'm not complaining about that! I'm just surprised that the faintly pretentious Masterpiece Theatre would go with something so softcore and frankly titillating. Alaistair Cooke might have rolled over in his grave. If you're a fan of Mr. Green from his police procedurals, tune into this for a completely different taste of his range. Mr. Green is indeed a well-rounded actor, and I mean that in every sense possible.",3,Serving up a Helping of the Delicious Robson Green,1222819200,"10 1, 2008",0.1994

And there is a bonus of episodes from a follow-up series to the original, something I missed when it was aired. Michael Kitchen is a riot, sublime in his comedic delivery. The romantic leads are wildly hot. All the supporting actors are perfectly cast. There is one actor whose accent is so thick, I barely understand what he says; however, his acting is so clear, I totally get what is going on in his scenes. There's a brief scene with a dog....

The plot concerns a love triangle that is a bit different from the normal love triangle. For women of a certain age-ahem-it is a delightful situation to find a younger man chasing an older married woman. Perhaps this sounds like a soap opera but I can assure this series is so much more. The acting, the dialog and the laugh-out-loud antics of the principals make this a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. I have loaned this set to friends and they,too, have enjoyed it.
