1,A1RRVA8V48LIV5,736915842,Angela S. Angela,"[12, 16]",This is a great video for Christians who want to do yoga without all the new age mumbo-jumbo. This workout is more suited for beginners. I've done Yoga for almost two years so I was disappointed that I didn't work up a sweat and I need a more advanced workout.,2,Christian Alternative to Yoga for Beginners,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",0.1311

3,A1L5EWG2UZCVK3,736915842,Kim Christain K,"[25, 27]","This is MUCH improved from her first video. The music is not annoying, she's got good people demonstrating proper positioning, and I really like how she narrates instead of talking while doing the routine. I think more videos should do that! I love her opening prayer and how the moves really put me in a spirit of praising God.This routine just seems too easy, like for senior citizens. It's nice to do on a rest day to keep myself limber and for meditating on the wonder of God.I will look for her new power version looking for something more challenging for the muscles. Keep it up Laurette! We all learn from trial and error.",3,Better,1265587200,"02 8, 2010",0.3376

Dunas avid reader,"[4, 10]","I found this DVD to be very well done - none of that froo froo sissy sissy stuff with the performers all oiled and made up with perfect hair, perfect make-up, and perfect appearances, while they sweat and work out. The music was good, the workouts outstanding and easily understood. I really enjoyed the entire experience.",5,Praise Moves - Christian alternative to yoga DVD.,1229558400,"12 18, 2008",0.778
