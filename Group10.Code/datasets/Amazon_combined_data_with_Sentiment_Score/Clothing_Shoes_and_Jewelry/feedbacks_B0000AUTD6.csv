0,A3GUYFGEQGW4F,B0000AUTD6,Adam L. Rogers,"[5, 5]","I was able to fit my 120lb ex in this bag (Just so we are clear it was when we were dating, I didn't kill her or anything). I use it to store a memroy foam mattress for transport to my college apt. This is a big and durable bag I have loaded lots into before and dragged to my car (Again...it was not a body). The zipper and bag seem pretty stout and have held up for me so far. A strap would be a nice addition if I had anything to gripe about it.",5,HUGE!!!,1378771200,"09 10, 2013",0.3627
1,A34U91XA1GB1SO,B0000AUTD6,Alec L,"[1, 2]","Solid, but the size 50X30 is soooo big, it's almost useless. I thought I would almost fit in there myself.Definitely not for the airports. Had it been 50X15 or 50X20 would be more appropriate.",4,"solid, but",1369699200,"05 28, 2013",-0.0514
2,A2AF6XLS7CU2BD,B0000AUTD6,Deadgecko,"[4, 4]","This bag far exceeded my expectations given the price, it was massive, fit in everything but the kitchen sink and didn't even get a scrape even after I dragged it across sidewalks, airports and on and off trains. If you need a bag this size, seriously don't even look at another bag. Buy it.",5,Awesome rugged bag!,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",-0.0208
3,A1JKH8XD9E3LTL,B0000AUTD6,Greg Johnson,"[0, 0]","I coach my son's little league team and decided to get my own equipment and bag. I bought this hoping it would have room for 5 batting helmets, catchers gear, balls and bats but for the price I wasn't expecting it to last more than the season.What I received is a monster of a bag. The quality is quite good and I see this bag lasting a very long time. It's actually far bigger than I need it to be. I would estimate that it holds around 8 to 10 loads of laundry. It's just enormous.I would definitely recommend it.",5,Much more than you would expect,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",0.2348
4,AN321GN9PLGQG,B0000AUTD6,Jan Bernier,"[1, 1]",This is very large and designed well. I will have lots of room for hunting equipment and will trust the tough design.,5,Nice Bag,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",0.3473
5,A2A3RL191N1RAK,B0000AUTD6,Jayde,"[0, 0]",When the bag for my tent started falling apart I bought this to replace it and this bag is nice. The seams are sewn well and you can tell it is very good quality. Would recommend.,5,quality..,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",0.435

7,A3M55R486M5RUF,B0000AUTD6,Kevin Johnson Kevin on-the-go,"[3, 3]","I was looking for a bag to keep my larger camping items. This bag is perfect. It holds all of the following: Coleman 6-person instant tent & rain fly, large Kelly shade house, two queen size inflatable mattresses, electric air pump, and 2 folding camp chairs!!!!!!!! Yea it takes 2 people to load/unload it from the truck, but all my stuff is in one place, and I only use this equipment for car camping.",5,Perfect!,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",0.143
8,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B0000AUTD6,Noname,"[0, 0]","I bought this Texsport bag to store myGuide Gear Double Wigwam Tent. This bag is huge and is big enough for my 8-man tent with room to spare. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't come with a strap. There are plastic loops where we can attach a strap, but we must supply our own straps. It does come with carry handles and a zipper down the middle, which I like more than the ones that open on the end.This is one tough bag. Great for camping. I'm glad I found it.",5,It's BIG.,1302825600,"04 15, 2011",0.1966
