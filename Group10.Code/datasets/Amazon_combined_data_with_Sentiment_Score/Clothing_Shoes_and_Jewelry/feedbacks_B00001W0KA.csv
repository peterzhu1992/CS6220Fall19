0,A1059SSXUZZS1S,B00001W0KA,Cassie,"[0, 0]","We got this costume for my son to wear to Disneyland. My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess, so he wanted to dress up, too. This costume is better quality than I had anticipated, based on some of the other reviews. It runs a little small, my son is five and the Child M (7-8) fits well over his clothes. The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants, and the costume can be worn without them. The arm panels, however, remain attached. The suit has an opening in the back, under the hood, for the child to get into it, and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it. This makes it a little bit awkward to get into, and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom. To use the bathroom, you have to take off the whole top of the costume, and then hold onto it so it doesn't touch a dirty bathroom floor (I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom). He absolutely LOVES the costume, and has worn it everywhere (except school) since he got it.",4,"Great Costume, Awkward To Put On",1383696000,"11 6, 2013",0.2295
1,A2VNCKMXMHN9E8,B00001W0KA,EAD,"[0, 0]",Purchased this costume (size 3T-4T) and it's a perfect fit for my very tall 2 year old son. I couldn't have asked for a better fit if we'd tried it on in a store first. I also bought the inflatable jet pack/wings. Can't wait to see him all dressed up on the big day!,5,Perfectly fits my 2 year-old :-),1383091200,"10 30, 2013",0.3487
2,A23GX78LIV4J2F,B00001W0KA,Edith W,"[0, 0]","I purchased this costume for my 6-year old grandson for Halloween 2011. It arrived one week earlier than expected, and I was happy about this. My grandson absolutely loved it! I'm glad I ordered the larger size (Size 8) because it barely fit him. The material was durable and well made, I think. He's worn it many times just to play in since Halloween. I was happy with the purchase which was worth the dollars I spent.",5,Great Buzz Lightyear Halloween Costume,1320537600,"11 6, 2011",0.4347

4,A2VHNDYD9B8PGO,B00001W0KA,Kathryn A. Mast,"[0, 0]","Good costume. Very detailed. I like that the body is a foam so it stands up a little on its own. You might not be able to tell from the picture, but there are shin-guard type pieces for the legs, and gauntlets on the sleeves. Nice touch. It is a little thin overall. You'll definitely want to put something underneath if you're in a colder climate. My only disappointment is that the back of the torso is entirely black. It's ok for us because I bought the inflatable wings, but without the wings, I think it would look weird.",4,My son loved it!,1353456000,"11 21, 2012",0.1173
5,A1FVO9ZB49ZCXA,B00001W0KA,KitchenKrazy,"[2, 4]","My 2.5 year old got the 3-4 year suit. It's a little tight to begin with, so he fit in it just fine. The pants were a little longer, but with shoes, he fit it, no problem. (He is average height and weight, for a 2.5 year old, according to docs.) If your child is meaty at all like mine is on top, I would suggest getting the larger size.After reading the other reviews about how flimsy this costume was, I didn't let my kiddo wear it until the actual day of Halloween. He ran around a lot but it didn't tear at all. I think it has a couple more good uses in it.If you are hoping to buy a costume that will last and will allow your child to play in it at home, I don't think this is the one. They have the $50 one that looks a lot more sturdier. But if it's just for this Halloween and maybe next year for the kiddo next door, then by all means, get this one!!! For the price we paid ($35), I am very happy with the purchase and the pictures of him enjoying being the Heroic Buzz will last forever, even if the suit doesn't!",4,"Super cute, but made for Halloween use only",1258502400,"11 18, 2009",0.3552
6,A37IOOK9CVRBND,B00001W0KA,kristens,"[0, 0]",This is one of the cutest costumes I've ever seen! My son loved being Buzz for Halloween and we got so many compliments while out in the neighborhood. The material is a little thin so we layered with a pair of white long johns and it worked great.,5,So cute!,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",0.6773
