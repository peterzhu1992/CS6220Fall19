But I had to laugh when I realized I could not enter my own combination numbers.....the maker actually gives you the combination you have to use on your lock and then you get to memorize THEIR numbers.....how stupid are we getting??",5,This is not your old high school lock.,1365811200,"04 13, 2013",0.2527

Easy to spot which locker is mine amoungst the dozens, most sporting boring black locks.",5,Love the color,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",0.0276
