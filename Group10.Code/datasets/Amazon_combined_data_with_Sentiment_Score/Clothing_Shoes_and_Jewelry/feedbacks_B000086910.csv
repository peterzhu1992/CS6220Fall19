I always buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts. The front of the bra sticks up and out (the under wire) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top. Getting it on was no picnic. I can usually reach back and snap it shut but this one refused as it felt too short. I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back. It was horrible and too tight. I tried to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out (muffin top). Nothing I did worked. All I keep thinking is that there is a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed like I am.

Lilyette quality has diminished dramatically over the past year and I was concerned about finding an alternative. I tried the Bali Satin Tracings Minimizer and was pleasantly surprised. The Bali is rather comfortable. Washes well. Life-span is average. You'll know when to buy new when you feel the fit change.It is also a 10X better minimizer than any other bra I've tried. In fact, I used to need apparel tape to keep the front of my blouses from gapping. With the Bali, my clothes fit perfectly without needing that bothersome tape. Hopefully, they will make this bra forever and leave it just the way it is...don't change the fabric, don't change anything to make it &#34;new and improved&#34;.",5,Great Bra,1359504000,"01 30, 2013",0.2499

It does go up a little into my arm pits, but I don't think that will bother me after it softens up a bit. Like the straps and shape of cups. Well made.
