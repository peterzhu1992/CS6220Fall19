0,A1J5D4YI4X1CIY,B000086211,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","I wear a 40DD but got the 40DDD instead since it was my first time ordering bras from Amazon. The fit would have been ideal if it wasn't padded. Women who already have large enough 'girls' do not need the padding. The bra looks perfect online, however, the workmanship left much to be desired. For example, the black lace flowers design that covers the beige material needed some more attention to be paid to it. While the flowers were pretty, each flower bud and petal had thread sticking out (the flowers are sewn on). All the manufacturers had to do was just clip off the extra pieces of thread. I plan to do just that.",3,Could be better but I've had worse.,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",0.2707

I wear it all day long and it is still comfortable at the end of the day. I usually get home from work thinking I can't WAIT to get this bra off. Not with this one.

The cups are also a little too small, and yes, as another reviewer mentioned, I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too. I would not recommend.

13,A372MRGDRTS413,B000086211,Raquel Edwards,"[1, 2]","Bought a 40DDD. This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy. It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous, The cups are moulded and - of course since it's Playtex - they are pointy. I was stunned at how horrible it looked on. Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable; they don't lie flat against your body, yet they chafe and rub. I've learned my lesson now. I'll never buy Playtex again.",1,Playtex has cornered the market on ugly bras,1353542400,"11 22, 2012",-0.2621

I am deployed in Afghanistan, so I do not have the luxury of trying items on before I buy, therefore, I am very impressed with the fit and will be ordering more of this exact bra, but in different colors. The shoulder straps are a perfect width - not too thick or thin. And the back strap is a good width for support and keeps bra muffin top away :)",5,GREAT Bra!,1345939200,"08 26, 2012",0.6567
