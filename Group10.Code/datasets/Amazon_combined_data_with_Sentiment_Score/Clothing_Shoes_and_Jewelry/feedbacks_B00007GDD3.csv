If it isn't snapped shut in both overlaying flaps everything is all over the ground with the risk of losing cards and IDs. I even had a nightmare about on my second day of owning this. lol,2,Cute but...,1364860800,"04 2, 2013",-0.0376

You just have to be prepared to have everything falling out all of the time. I taught a class, and one of my students came into my class carrying my debit card saying that I dropped it in the parking lot. I'm glad someone nice found it.",3,Needs a better way to secure items,1386547200,"12 9, 2013",0.3536
2,A5IJ5JFMM2POQ,B00007GDD3,Beverly pearlette,"[4, 4]","There are many things I do love about the purse - the size is perfect. The inside pocket is a nice size. However the upper flap that has slots for your credit cards is exposed to the outer edge. After using this purse for a couple weeks and taking my debit card in and out, the slot became loose and my debit card slid out into the unknown and was lost. That is a major design flaw. For that reason alone, I cannot give this purse a higher rating.",3,Wanted to love this purse.,1376438400,"08 14, 2013",0.128

4,A1BUXI30VSG51W,B00007GDD3,Happy,"[0, 0]",I bought this purse because I don't like carrying around a large purse but I need a lot of pockets for all my stuff. This fit the bill perfectly. It's large enough yet large enough to hold what I need,5,Great purse,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",0.2099
5,A2ZF1G1YHO2PBJ,B00007GDD3,Janet,"[0, 0]",Actually this bag is made great but it has twice as many places to put cards as I need. I bought it so I would always have a small black bag and now I do mission accomplished.,4,good small bag,1403481600,"06 23, 2014",0.406
6,A1W7ZXNLCIJSAP,B00007GDD3,Joanna S.,"[0, 0]","This purse is very likeable. It's a handy, small size and the leather is quite soft to touch. The drawback is that the gap at the top when the purse is clasped is so large little items may fall out. With the price of lipstick these days, I won't chance carrying it loose in this purse! I did keep the purse, though, thinking I can use it for special occasions when it suits my outfit. On those occasions, I plan to put the smaller items in a cosmetic bag and carry that inside the purse.",3,"Very Nice, But has a Drawback",1402358400,"06 10, 2014",0.0996

I carry a Nokia 1520 cell phone and it fits perfectly, even with my checkbook. So easy to stay organized with all the pockets. Its held up pretty well too, and I'm not overly careful. I would definitely recommend this.",5,this is perfect,1404691200,"07 7, 2014",0.5101
8,A20H6P0WMEWNZN,B00007GDD3,PJ,"[0, 0]",I love this bag as an option to switch to a smaller carry option. The only problem I had was the snap closure is tight and actually pulled out from the bag when I tried harder to open it. I've pushed it back in but don't use it much because of this.,3,Cute bag,1395187200,"03 19, 2014",0.0783

The style is nice, though, with lots of room for the amount of stuff I carry. I wish the credit card slots were enclosed within the pouch of the bag for more security. I ordered a credit card stacker to play it safe. Overall, it's a nice mini bag for carrying cash,cards and my smartphone.05/05: Today I tried to open the inner flap and the clasp was stuck fast and I ended up tearing it. Too bad because the red one I have is still doing fine with normal wear.",3,A little dark but still nice,1367539200,"05 3, 2013",0.2994
