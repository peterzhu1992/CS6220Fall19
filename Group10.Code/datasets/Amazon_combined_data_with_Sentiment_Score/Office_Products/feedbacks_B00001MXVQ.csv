1,AR74YY08IP2WE,B00001MXVQ,Dave Dave,"[1, 1]","UPDATE: After a couple of weeks my opinion of this has dropped. The only good thing is that it has the same nylon covering as the original version. But the gel (or whatever they use now, it used to be gel) feels as hard as a rock and is really unpleasant to use. I thought I could live with the thinner padding but this is really really unpleasant to use.This isn't a worthless wrist rest but I'm giving it one star because Fellowes shouldn't be selling this under the same product ID (down to the model number) when it's significatnly different.It is significantly shallower (in terms of thickness) and hence doesn't offer nearly as much padding. It's also shallower front to back.This isn't a bad wrist rest (and they are much cheaper now: I paid roughly $13 for this compared to $18 4 years ago for the same product ID), but they are not in any way the previous generation.Some people might consider this a better product as they make not like the height of the earlier ones.",1,Not the same product and worse in every way,1354147200,"11 29, 2012",0.1094

The only complaint is when you take the wrist rest out of thee package it has a terrible odor and it take a few days to go away, if you do not mind the smell it is a great wrist rest. I have owned it for 3 days and the smell is still there but the smell us much less, so I have decided to keep it.",3,Good Gel Wrist Rest,1233360000,"01 31, 2009",0.2023
3,A3CG6YLYZJXQG4,B00001MXVQ,Tracy Rowan dargelos,"[16, 19]","Thanks to a severe flare-up of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, I found myself in a lot of pain after a day of typing. I finally broke down and bought wrist wrests for both my keyboard and my trackball, and I'm glad I did even though both took some major getting used to. The keyboard rest is great in most respects, but for me it has two drawbacks: It could be a bit longer, and it pushes the top of my keybard up under my desk (I have a pull-out shelf arrangement.) Neither is the fault of Fellowes necessarily, and I mention it only to alert anyone who has a very wide or deep keyboard to these possible (minor) problems. I do find, however, that the rest isn't quite high enough for me to avoid some stressing of my wrists.On the plus side, it's got a backing that's so extremely non-skid that you have to lift it up to move it. And the gel is loads of fun to play with while you're thinking. I find myself pinching and poking it, and wondering how long it can take that sort of punishment before it breaks or tears. I don't recommend this sort of behavior, but if you're prone to it, this might well give some scope to your nervous figets.",4,"What the doc ordered, if a little awkward to use",1007164800,"12 1, 2001",-0.0259

Whatever the reason, it busted open (cool to see the gel stuff though :) Won't buy ever again, though.",1,Busted Open Second Day,1383609600,"11 5, 2013",-0.0964
