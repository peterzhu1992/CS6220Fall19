But I didnt return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls? because 1. I didnt feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2. So that i wouldn't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it's okay that my order got wrong. I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened... They are nice notebooks though. Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot (which I don't unless its a math or number involved class)I like them.",2,Order got messed up,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",-0.025
1,A353U0L2HAMSHV,B000053HJJ,Cricket Living life and loving it!,"[1, 1]","My daughter goes through about 15-20 of these notebooks a year in High School. The last time we went to a B&M store to purchase them they were out of the College Ruled ones and only had Wide Ruled, which isn't accepted in her school. I was very happy and surprised to see that Amazon had them for less than $1, so I picked up the limit of three. They are now on the list of items I will order regularly, easy enough to add to any order I'm placing to avoid shipping them on their own and causing more wasted packaging.",5,A must have school supply,1256083200,"10 21, 2009",0.039
2,ABDR6IJ93HFIO,B000053HJJ,Daisy Daisy S,"[0, 0]","For me, I prefer the college ruled notebooks and paper because it just plain holds more info and the notebook last longer. This Mead is top notch quality that I use in different colors and write with different pens and pencils. The paper is of excellent quality so that whatever pen or pencil I choose, the page is highly readable with no smears.This notebook is suitable for any age from young students to senior adults. And I have found these notebooks I keep records in and love to use them next to my computer when I take notes from my computer research.This is a must have spiral notebook as in my opinion, Mead is the BEST ONE!",5,This high quality spiral notebook has so many uses!,1383782400,"11 7, 2013",0.3483
3,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,B000053HJJ,D. Blankenship,"[21, 22]","Okay, there are some pretty basic reasons I use these particular notebooks. First and most importantly, they are cheap! I go through dozens upon dozens of these things a year, to the extent that cost does matter. I use them for everything...more about that later. Secondly, they are college ruled. I have a real hang up about that and have almost a phobia about using the wider ruled note books. Thirdly, the quality of the paper is what I want...it holds ink pretty well, are better than some about ink bleeding through, but most importantly, it holds simple old graphite from my pencils. The white color of the pages makes my feeble attempts at penmanship readable and does not stress my eyes in the bright sun light. For me, these notebooks are simply work horses.Now if I were setting on the Board of Directors of a Fortune 500 company, I probably would not use these things during meetings (well, actually I would, cause I am me, but most people would not), but as I do not hold such a dubiously exalted position, and it is a pretty good bet that I never will, I need not worry about appearances in that particular setting.I do use these things for everything else though. As I read, I take notes. I am a list maker and manically and obsessively create list of just about anything you can imagine. I have lists dating back for well over 60 years, many of which I have no clue as to what I was listing or why, but never-the-less, I have my precious lists. These books are ideal for making shopping lists, chore lists, things to do lists and more. Having different colors is a big advantage when you are a multiple list maker like me as it helps to organize things a bit. I also use these to write things down as I have problems with my memory at times. I wish I could say that this was because I am getting a bit long in the tooth, but that would be a lie. I have been forgetting things since I was a wee lad and learned a long time ago that it is best to write things down. I have boxes and trunks filled with old notebooks of things I was an am suppose to remember...never look at most of them of course, but they are there if I need them! I am also an obsessive drawer and these are ideal for making rough sketches and strange designs.I like these thinner 70 page models over the thicker three or more subject ones as I tend to lose many of these notebooks and it is nicer to lose a few pages versus many pages.I must have hundreds of these things filled from cover to cover from my school days. My children will no doubt have a wonderful burning one of these days.Are these books a pure class act? Hardly, but they are cheap, serviceable, easy to find and extremely functional. It has been years since I felt the need to impress anyone with my writing materials (actually, that is a lie also, due to the fact that to the best of my knowledge, I have never felt this need to impress anyone as to the aspect of my life), and I seriously doubt if I will change my way as I have gotten worse about such things over the years.This is a very good buy here on Amazon and it is good to throw a few of these things with your order so you can hit the no shipping fee zone.I highly recommend this serviceable product.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,WORK HORSES...CHEAP WORK HORSES...THIS IS GOOD.,1262304000,"01 1, 2010",0.3595

Note that Amazon only lets you buy one with each order, but it can help you make the $25 free shipping threshold. At present, these are going for 48 cents versus the 51 cents I paid. You cannot purchase these in the grocery store for that price, which is where I usually get them. I go through these notebooks regularly, using them for shopping lists and planning events. Okay, I'm getting to the point that at times I have to write things down because I can't remember them otherwise. You say, why not post its? Yes, I use those too, but occasionally the project is much more than a post it can handle. For instance, when I go away for one or two weeks, there are a number of things I have to remember to do during the seven days before I leave. So, I dedicate a page for each day and write down the things that have to be done. Similarly, Thanksgiving is coming up. For the two weeks prior, I have a ton of things that need to be done before T Day, and then each day I check off the things as they are completed. Never mind Christmas. You get the idea. I don't care about whether there is a particular quality to the paper or whether the perforation is perfect. The pages are torn out as tasks are completed. And yes, I have even given them to my grandkids for their school projects, with no complaints.",5,"Shopping list, anyone?",1256774400,"10 29, 2009",0.0969
