I wish I had this throughout HS. Would have made copying things easier.",4,Reasonable Enough,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",0.2058
1,AKU18EGFF6G02,B00004Z5QI,Amazon Customer,"[2, 2]","This stand may be good for pamphlets, ring-bound manuals, magazines and typing sheets but definitely not for text books. It is unstable and the page holders can't hold any page open for even a nano second. Try the The Easi-Reader Bookstand or Mighty Bright Folding/Adjustable Book Holder instead.",2,Not For Text Books,1266883200,"02 23, 2010",0.2499
2,A3FARCKMBHQZLY,B00004Z5QI,givpilot,"[3, 3]","I don't understand the number of negative reviews... this product works great. Some reviewers said it's plastic and breaks easily. Yes, it's plastic and I suppose you could break it without too much difficulty but it doesn't break under normal use. I use mine to hold open textbooks that measure 10x16 (when open) and are over 500 pages. The book holder works fine in all respects. Specifically, it supports the book without tipping or wobbling as I turn the pages, the pages are prevented from turning by themselves even with a fan blowing on it, I can slide it across my desk without it collapsing and when I'm done it folds flat for easy storage. One feature I really like is the fact that the tabs that normally hold the pages in place can be folded flat to accommodate very large books (700+ pages). I don't know what else I could ask from a product such as this! I can recommend this product without reservation.",5,Great Textbook Holder,1283472000,"09 3, 2010",0.3115

5,AC11GZAL5N99C,B00004Z5QI,missed mist.,"[0, 0]","This book holder is made of plastic and seems a little flimsy, but so far it's holding up decently. The back stand uses two pieces, and is adjustable. There are two tabs in the front which you can move forward and backward so that you can turn pages more easily or insert new books without fear of ruining a page. They are also a problem. I have found that they can pop out from use as they only have a fitted notch keeping them in place at the bottom of the unit.I can also see how a book larger than 2 inches in thickness can be an issue, as the depth of the base is roughly an inch deep. I've not yet had to work with this (I use it for typing up class notes from notebooks at this time) with a book of that size, but i can picture my coffee cup coming into play if I ever use it with a book of that size.",4,decent and useful,1220659200,"09 6, 2008",0.1331
6,A1855L4WZL0J31,B00004Z5QI,MMJT,"[0, 0]","I'm really enjoy this book holder. It holds large and small books at various weights. At first I didn't think it would because it's made out of plastic, but it's pretty sturdy. Also love the fact that it folds up and can be inserted in a binder for easy transportation.",5,Great Book Holder,1369699200,"05 28, 2013",0.4966
7,A1XFBV9YUVZXKA,B00004Z5QI,sedona artist CJS,"[0, 0]",This is a friendly book holder. I use this everyday in my studio. It holds the pages of my books open and can be adjusted to any angle I choose. I'm thinking about buying another for my cook books in the house. I have to lift the book out of the one in the house to turn the page.,5,Buy it!,1402185600,"06 8, 2014",0.0988
