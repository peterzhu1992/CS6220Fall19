0,A13WBUX01Q4D35,B00000K3T0,adammb,"[0, 0]",I needed a calculator that could replace my simple desk calculator for quick figures at my desk. This one has done very well and seems like it will last some time. I bought Canon as that was my old brand and I like it although since I have large hands I wish it was a tad bit bigger. It was hard to determine which one to get shopping online but I am happy with it. There really is nothing I would like to change on it and will use it for years. Not much else to say as it is a basic calculator.,5,A great office calculator with no frills needed,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",0.2775
1,A3NHUQ33CFH3VM,B00000K3T0,Citizen John,"[2, 2]","I used this very calculator at my old office and it lasted for years. That's why I've kept on buying them. Of all the calculators I have and use, this is my favorite by far and I use it the most. The keys are great - they're large and spaced apart to reduce input errors, making this the easiest-to-use calculator I've had. The display is large, raised and easy to see.What makes this calculator so nice is you barely notice it because it allows you to concentrate on what you're doing. Sure it doesn't have lots of functions, just the basic ones, but I have another calculator for that. I tend to use this one all the time and I'd feel lost without it.This is a remarkable, durable and useful calculator. I'm perform a lot of accounting in my job, and this is my normal go-to calculator. From the time I ordered it to delivery, only 13.5 hours passed. That's the fastest I've had an order fulfilled. Just thought I'd relate that.",5,My Favorite Calculator - I've purchased 4,1285027200,"09 21, 2010",0.2585

I think they are both competent calculators and do what they are supposed to do, except that the 82Z is $6.66 cheaper!

4,A2A1XYSB692L6J,B00000K3T0,Patricia A Reader,"[13, 14]","What does another excellent, but smaller Canon calculator -- the CanonLS-82z -- want to be when it grows up? Right! THIS calculator -- the Canon LS 85H calculator!``The smaller calculator -- also reviewed for me by Amazon -- is an excellent little machine. But I can see how its smaller size, (and in particular, smaller keys), would be a problem for those using it on a continual basis. Men especially, as they tend to have larger hands than women....The slightly larger, Cannon LS 85H calculator, being reviewed here, is almost as perfect a general-purpose calculator as one can find these days! A handy size, which is at home either on desk-top or pocket/purse.Man-size keys, which are still not overwhelmingly large, which a person with the largest hands, and also one with the smallest, can usewith the utmost of ease. The eight-digit display is large, and very well spaced. Nice little extras, found in most -- but not all -- other general-purpose calculators: a percent key, a square root key, and a sign change key. (The sign-change key does not appear on the smaller, LS-82Z).True, the larger LS-85H calculator has an enclosed, wrap-around display, (enclosing the entire top part, all together), rather than the picture-frame display, (in which the numberic display is indented, and framed by the rest of the top of the calculator) of the smaller calculator. (And I, personally, find the picture-frame display far more attractive). But the larger LS-85H calculator stays on for approximately 3 minutes before turning itself off...approximately a full minute more than the smaller machine, and this may mean more to many users.About the only things missing from this calculator are an off key, (not found on the LS-82z, or on most other calculators, either), a resume key, (found, at present, only on the large and somewhat cumbersome Sharp (R) VX=2128R calculator -- but a feature that would be welcome on ANY calculator!), and a live battery, (you know -- anAA battery, or even two --which can easily be replaced. Like they used to have when calculators first came out?)Oh, oh...wait a minute! I see that Canon ALSO has, (or had), another model that looks ALMOST like this one does, but which has, as a model number, LS-85H 4050A001AA! Looking at the description of it....YES! It has a live battery! AA! Sadly, there was only one of these for sale......and, yes....this reviewer has done what the vast majority of people would do under the same circumstances....grab it! Hopefully, Canon will produce more of this AA powered portable calculator....as will all other calculator manufacturers! Replacable lithium batteries are just NOT easy to replace! (I see that Canon DOES have a larger, 12-digit AA powered calculator, still on sale! -- Canon 7438A003AA). It got one 3 star review....but if I wanted a larger, 12-digit calculator which uses a AA battery, I'd try this one for sure.Anyway, the Canon LS-85H, which is the main calculator being reviewed here, is a good, basic, little machine, with size, keys, and basic features, that feel, and respond, just right. Great for Goldilocks, or anyone else you know -- even yourself!",5, T H I S ...O N E...I S....J_U_S_T.....R_I_G_H_T__! ,1220745600,"09 7, 2008",0.2062
