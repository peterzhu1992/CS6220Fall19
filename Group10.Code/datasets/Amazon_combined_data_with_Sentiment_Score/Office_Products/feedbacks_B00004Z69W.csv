Since then, we've used it on just about every event we send invitations for. In addition, we've also used these to print labels for just about anything (plain shoe boxes, photo boxes, labels on back of pictures, gift bags, and fancy name tags for drinking glasses/cups at parties).Because it is clear, it can go on any color of envelope (except the dark ones). Labels printed fine on our inkjet printers (HP Deskjet PSC 750, Canon Pixma MX870, Epson Artisan 810) in black & white and in color, and the results were excellent. I've used it on laserjets as well (HP Color LJ 3550 and HP 2420), and it prints fine. I just let the printed product sit a few minutes, just in case the laserjet ink was still wet (I've actually tried to smudge a few labels after printing on a laserjet, and the ink did NOT smudge at all). The results were just as good as the deskjet printed set. Word 2003 and 2007 has the proper template for this product. The template for Word XP and Word 2000 can be downloaded from [...].The labels are easy to peel, thanks to the pop-up edge for easy peeling. Because they are clear, they are virtually invisible when applied to almost any colored surfaces. This gives the finished product a professional look without the professional price.Though we've gone through many of these over the years, I've only just got to write a review for this recently. I highly recommend this product.",5,Great little labels for just about anything,1281571200,"08 12, 2010",0.3977

But this is the first time I've ever used the clear versions and I have to say, this is a darn good product and I'd probably buy more.The labels do smudge rather easily and this might be difficult to see when the labels are still on the carrier sheet, but you can see the smudges kind of easily after they are stuck down on your envelopes, so a bit of care and clean hands are needed when doing large mailings.The ink from my printer dried pretty quickly on these labels and it seemed more crisp (with no ink spread) than others I've used and they ran through my printer with zero problems.These labels peel fairly easily off the carrier sheet and the transparent label stock looks great on various kinds of envelopes, colors and textures which makes it seem like the label is made of the same material as your surface at first glance.As others here have written you can also use these for handwritten labeling as well as machine labeling and the quantity is enough for most basic mailings or labeling jobs.

If you have MS WORD, you can just go to labels, select the #8660 and start typing away. You can create one label or a whole sheet of labels with the same or different addresses. If you don't have MS WORD you can go to Avery's website and download templates for Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign. Don't have any of those programs, no problem because you can download -- for free -- Avery's Designer Pro for either Mac or PC and you can design in that program.Since the labels are clear, the typeface will stand out from the background color of the envelope and looks really elegant even if you're using white colored envelopes.They're easy to peel off and stick securely, and if you have an odd sized or shaped envelope, you don't have to fight with the printer to accept it and risk ruining as it goes through the feeder. You just print on the label and then fix it to the envelope.Avery also has pre-designed templates that feature clip art on the labels that you can download, also for free, so you can make personalized invitations or holiday cards etc.I highly recommend AVERY LABELS 8660 for ease of use and professional looking quality.",5,*Easy* To Use And Looks *Nicer* Than White Labels...,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",0.4752

It is also easy and a time-saver. This is an excellent feature.Also, I ran a few labels twice through my Epson ink jet printer. The ink appears to dry like on paper, and there was no smudging even when I tried with my finger.

The clear showed air pockets on the bubble containers, and (even after letting the labels dry overnight) when I tried to smooth them out, there was some smudging.

They are matte-satin finished and print out beautifully on both inkjet and laser printers. The copier and writing in ballpoint pen works well too.2) Avery Label templates are already in many common off-the-shelf word processing softwares.

Label measurements are also easily found if a new template needs to be created from scratch.3) The templates are easy to use and understand.4) The instructions in the package itself are clear and easy to understand and markings help the correct insertion of the label page into the printer/copier.5) Ink dries quickly.and the best new feature?6) The easy tear feature which allows a) half-sheet printing and b) easy label removal from the sheet. As warmth from a printer or copier heat up the glue on the labels, a sheet can only be run a certain number of times before there are runner marks on the label and the adhesive starts to denature from heat, affecting stickiness and colour (yellowing).

20,A22KGO6Q2YWS0C,B00004Z69W,Dean!,"[4, 4]","I have to give this product 3 stars because these labels are not super clear more closer to clear-frost. My definition of Clear is, whether the envelope is pure white or colored, you should be able to apply this label and unless you catch the address at just the right angle, you may or may not see a glossiness where the label has been affixed.Why is this such an important point?? Well, we used these labels for our wedding invitations and RSVP cards. We spent top-dollar on some premium cream-white envelopes and expecting the label to mostly vanish since it was clear, it did not. It leaves a clear-frosted solid-rectangle of the entire label. I've seen other types of super-clear labels and you can barely see the edge of the label and the rest of the truly transparent label simply vanishes, except for the printed address. These exact labels are not like that, they are not truly transparent. We felt the appearance cheapend our hard work on the invitations and premium envelopes we purchased. We felt it was somewhat false advertising for the 'clear' part.Also on the easy peel part, these labels were no easier to unpeel than any others we've used, in fact, all of the constant easy peeling somewhat crinkles the rest of the labels. The description for this product says, ... bend the sheet to expose the trademarked Pop-up Edge for fast peeling and fold the sheet back to flat - yea, do this 20 times and you'll no doubt have crinkles in your other labels. So I somewhat disagree with the easy peel marketing.###So my rating of 3 stars is for my comments above, the rest of my review is to help out fellow Amazon-ers and is NOT related to the 3 stars above:########################Note: if you are using these with standard white envelopes, yes you'll be fine, just be forewarned if you use non-white envelopes.I did ruin 2 sheets because they misfed, even though they were perfectly aligned in the paper tray, so I'm not blaming Avery, as it could have been the printer's paper-feed mechanism. To save you from ruining a sheet, I found the best way is to select Manual Feed and print only ONE sheet at a time; do not load multiple sheets as they could get misfed. Once we loaded one sheet at a time, we were fine. I was careful not to force the paper into the paper-feed, rather, allow the printer to gently pull the individual page of labels.I did use the 8660 code inside of Microsoft Word and the template of labels was a perfect fit when printed (and when I fed the labels correctly).",3,"Not really clear for fancy wedding envelopes, closer to frosted",1287619200,"10 21, 2010",0.2819

I really love that new design.The labels also went through my printer with no issue. I was worried that because they've eliminated that outer quarter inch of excess label and just left the labels themselves on the sheet, that the sheets might get stuck in my printer or not feed as well.

52,A3FKGKUCI3DG9U,B00004Z69W,Paul Moskowitz,"[0, 0]","Our town's energy committee recently had a project for which we needed about 250 peel-off labels. Our plan was to distribute 250 CFL (compact fluorescent) light bulbs free at our town's community day (sort of like a street fair) in order to encourage people to use the bulbs to reduce electricity use. CFL light bulbs can save about 75 percent on electricity over incandescent bulbs. For the 250 bulbs, we calculated that for 8000 hours of use and an electric cost of $0.10/KWh the total savings vs. 100 watt incandescent bulbs for all the bulbs would be about $15,000. There would also be a saving of 94 tons of carbon dioxide emission.Avery Address Labels were a good choice for adding a label indicating the savings for using the bulbs and our committee's name. The question was how to get the information printed on the labels. At the Avery web site, I found free software, DesignPro, which makes it possible to produce label designs for different label sizes. I downloaded the software easily and got started on the designFor the labels, there were about a dozen pre-made templates for the different size labels. I chose the template that matched my labels. Using DesignPro was a little like using PowerPoint. I was able to cut and paste a graphics image, add the appropriate text, and choose a font for the text. A test run on my printer produced a beautiful matrix of labels. The only problem was to find out which side of the label stock had to be up. I can never remember. After an up/down test, I had my sheets of labels printed in no time.Our community day give-away was a big success. Our free light bulbs lasted about four hours. We were able to peel the labels from the printed sheets easily. There was enough time to peel and apply the labels as we gave away the CFLs. One surprise is that we had to have a sales pitch even for give-aways. The other surprise was that many people had never seen CFLs before.

Since I use Office Products, I used the Word template.I found the template to be easy to use and was able to export my mailing list so that I could print my labels with no issue. The nice part about these labels is that they essentially disappear onto the envelope that you are using so only the printing really shows up. This makes it look as if you had inserted the envelope into a typewritter (anyone out there besides me remember those?) and printed out the address.The only caution I have has to do with inkjet printers in general and that is to be careful about getting your label wet as the print will run. My early solution to this problem was to put a piece of clear shipping tape over the label. My current method of dealing with this is to use a Kodak Printer as their ink will not run or smear when it gets wet.I gave this product a 4 star instead of 5 star as I still find the labels difficult to remove from the sheet if you only print one or two labels.

They're advertised as clear - don't expect shiny-clear, like a piece of cellophane tape. Instead, they've got somewhat of a mildly-milky matte finish, like Scotch brand Magic Tape, that doesn't exactly disappear when applied to surfaces.

69,A22I55P15NSAOX,B00004Z69W,Two kids mom scienceteachermom,"[0, 0]","I LOVE these labels. The surface is a sort of matte texture, making them almost disappear when placed on an envelope. Printing on an inkjet printer yields sharp and smearless results. They look a lot classier on an envelope than the standard white mailing labels.These are useful not only for mailing, but for labeling almost anything. I will still use my label maker for stuff that gets a lot of abuse or get wet (like soccer balls and drink cups) but these are much more discrete for labeling other possessions.I keep a three ring binder filled with printed address labels stored in slash pocket folders with tabs (labeled with a sample label)for the addresses I use frequently. However, when sending something nice like a birthday card I was never pleased with the way the white labelss looked. These solve my problem. I printed up a sheet for all my favorite addresses and stuck them in my binder for use on more formal mail. I also printed up a sheet with Fragile, do not bend for when I mail photos. Since they are clear it is easier to find a spot to put them without covering up addresses.I have avoided clear labels in the past due to problems with them jamming the printer, clumping up when you try to peel them and generally being difficult to work with in every way. These labels are much, much better than the previous clear labels and simply work.",5,"Crisp clear professional looking results with inkjet, almost invisible.",1282694400,"08 25, 2010",0.1354

Just the right size for regular envelopes, and the look was exactly what we were going for.One suggestion - if you're not using the whole page of labels, and want to use the remaining labels later, take a piece of white paper, and tape it over the labels you are not using. The labels get darker every time you run them through the printer. It's hard to notice on the page, but once you affix them to the envelope, they can look a bit dirty.",5,Perfect for Invitations,1242777600,"05 20, 2009",0.0209

Once printed, the labels are simple to remove and did not tear. These are a must have if you're wanting to put labels on colored envelopes or otherwise want a nicer finish than a colored or more visible label. These work great!",5,Easy to Use,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",0.4518

I was pleased to have this product come up in the Vine Newsletter since I replaced my laser with an Epson 810 inkjet all in one. I also just ran out of pre-printed labels of all sorts (including the freebees and the donate bait).The 8660 is a standard label in MS Word and Open Office, and that glable in UBUNTU supported them as well. Software - no sweat (besides they have free stuff on the web) and I had plenty of options (besides I'd already set up the laser version)I slipped a sheet of these in the Epson and fired off a page of return address labels. They worked like a charm, positioned themselves properly, type was crisp and clean and dried quickly. The easy peel worked as advertised and the labels looked great on the day's outgoing mail of all types.I've since run some special labels with color print and graphics and was impressed by the output. No glitches with multiple sheets either.They do the job and they do it right. Can't ask for more than that.",5,Just about perfect.,1280275200,"07 28, 2010",0.2739
