We got a great deal and a good amount of them when they were offered. The spiral didn't unwind like some of lesser quality do. We use these spirals for work, school and home use.",5,What a wonderful ADD ON product,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",0.1732

3,AAPPWNP9FWVWS,B00004YV1W,Kathlyn Storey Kathlyn A Storey,"[1, 2]","This purchase is such a no brainer. Note that Amazon only lets you buy a total of three of these, but it can help you make the $25 free shipping threshold. At present, these are going for 45 cents versus the 51 cents I paid. You cannot purchase these in the grocery store for that price, which is where I usually get them. I go through these notebooks regularly, using them for shopping lists and planning events. Okay, I'm getting to the point that at times I have to write things down because I can't remember them otherwise. You say, why not post its? Yes, I use those too, but occasionally the project is much more than a post it can handle. For instance, when I go away for one or two weeks, there are a number of things I have to remember to do during the seven days before I leave. So, I dedicate a page for each day and write down the things that have to be done. Similarly, Thanksgiving is coming up. For the two weeks prior, I have a ton of things that need to be done before T Day, and then each day I check off the things as they are completed. Never mind Christmas. You get the idea. I don't care about whether there is a particular quality to the paper or whether the perforation is perfect. The pages are torn out as tasks are completed. And yes, I have even given them to my grandkids for their school projects, with no complaints.",5,My organizer,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",0.0969

5,A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B00004YV1W,Noname,"[1, 1]","I bought a whole case of these Mead spiral notebooks for my kids. The pages are thin, they aren't perforated, but the price was right (back to school sales) and I'm not expecting much for school notebooks. My biggest qualm is the wire spiral eventually getting tangled around the holes on the left edge. It's not neat and pretty after a while and the covers don't sit well then. They do start out looking nice and I'm not really complaining.The pages are wide-ruled, good for elementary school kids. Both of my kids use them and they don't have any issues with them.",3,Decent,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",-0.0035

The price alone for this notebook is good, but when you consider free delivery, it's an even better deal. I always like having spare notebooks around in case I need notebook paper or a student needs paper. The paper is wide ruled for those who like that configuration. Pages aren't perforated for easy removal, but at this price point it can't be expected.This notebook has the SFI, certified sourcing emblem on the cover.",4,Meads My Needs,1374278400,"07 20, 2013",0.2822

They are affordable and always ship quickly, arriving in pristine condition. Colors are variable. Nothing out of the ordinary here, just a notebook you could buy at a store, but it's nice to have it delivered without paying more rather than having to buy it at the store. Another advantage is that you can have them shipped in bulk. I tend to go through a lot of notebooks and I've been pleased with the service ordering through Amazon. I recommend it.",5,Affordable notebook shipped fast,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",0.2741
