0,A2KY76HK8DYRL3,B00006I9VJ,A Book a Day,"[0, 1]","I couldn't believe when I pulled this out of the box that it was basically set up! The white board simply slides up and you screw the giant handles on the sides to add tension so that it stays upright. Although I ran out of flip chart paper to slide into the top holder, I very easily got a note pad in there and the design appears to fit perfectly with the top border of flip chart paper to make it secure. The only thing that I'm not used to working with flip chart boards is that the base legs don't seem to separate that far, but I've pushed it and written on it and it's sturdy enough and won't tip over that easily. I love how it's one easy piece that is easily adjustible for height and is double sided so you could have a white board on both sides, or white board on one side and flip chart on the other. Very versatile.",5,"Versatile, collapsible, and very easy to set up.",1403740800,"06 26, 2014",0.3097
1,A1W415JP5WEAJK,B00006I9VJ,Alex S,"[13, 13]","We have been using this particular DryErase/Flip Chart outside of our store for 2 years now. We do not use it as an Easel, but rather as a hanging board (where it hangs downward) to promote specials and products.After purchasing another product that didn't work, we were especially grateful to purchase this particular one. It is sturdy, and except in high winds, we do not have a problem with it blowing over. Best of all, we can write on both sides - either turning it sideways so it can be seen by cars / Pedestrians coming from either direction, or facing front, with the ability to turn it later in the day to promote a different sale (especially helpful for Thanksgiving day sales).As a small business owner, I appreciate the flexibility of being able to promote items without a lot of hassle, and this particular chart has been especially helpful to us.",5,Using as Sign Board,1256774400,"10 29, 2009",0.5292
2,A2KMV056844YV2,B00006I9VJ,Book Lover CYN,"[1, 1]",The Quarter Easel Whiteboard and Flipchart is perfect for Sunday School at my church. I like the double sided writing surface and angled feature for good viewing across the classroom. I just wish I could get one for every classroom. The board is very sturdy and well built. It does take two people to set it up and secure the legs. The double-sided white board makes it a reversible writing space. It also will hold the Easel Pads 27 x 34 Inch. I highly recommend this easel whiteboard for a small office or classroom use.,5,Perfect for Sunday School,1403568000,"06 24, 2014",0.3707

This easel style whiteboard is stupid easy to set up. It comes assembled already. All you do is adjust the height to where you want it, and tighten the knobs so it stays put. Then, it stays exactly where you put it until you're ready to adjust it again. You can write on both sides. Both top and bottom have the little marker holding tray on it. The legs spread out so that the easel stays nice and stable on the ground. This makes life so much easier to study, because everything is right there.",5,HUGE board.,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",0.1932

I use this almost daily and have transported from office to office (and used it at our garage sale!). It wipes off very easy (often I just use a paper towel). I love that it turns into a table (we used it as a small table at our garage sale to display books!). I think this would be great for a teacher or real estate agent or any sort of person who makes presentations (or even in a cafe as a &#34;special&#34; of the day board).Love it!,5,"Portable, Durable, Great Tool",1404604800,"07 6, 2014",0.3642

It even can be used as a table top but I don't use it that way. It is easy to move. We have dragged this all over the house and out to the barn to list the days work or anything else. It is so stable, we used it on a float in a parade. It wipes of easily. And the frame seems like it is going to last.I am very pleased",5,Fantastic,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",0.3162

9,A2VH0UT5EQFB6P,B00006I9VJ,Loveguitar,"[0, 0]","This thing is pretty cool! It's bigger than I expected, and blocks out nearly all the light from the window behind it. I've been needing something like this for a long time though, so light or no light I find it very useful. I teach classical guitar and often need to draw out chords, music or whatever for my students and this is plenty big enough for me to not only draw out the Treble Clef, but the Bass Clef underneath and show how the the two clefs are related. This is a big deal to me because before I was trying to use staff paper and it wasn't designed for that purpose, or use a very small white board that wouldn't hold nearly enough information.I have the tray already loaded with various expo markers and a couple of erasers. The easel is steadier than I expected, and being tall, I can slide it upwards and tighten down the two knobs on each side and it seems to hold alright. The paper catch at the top is a nice touch though I have to work a bit to get any papers to catch in it. I doubt I'll be using that function much, if any. And I'll only be using one side of it, but it's a white board on both sides if you need that.So overall, it's really good. I'm hesitant to give it 5 stars yet because it's kind of pricey, and I don't know yet how well it will stand (pun intended) the test of time.

There are other styles that are more stable by definition. But, of the ones that I have used that are this style, this one seems very stable . You need to learn the rhythm of how to set it up by yourself and it's much easier with more than one set of hands. But, that's true of the design, not this specific product. I can do it by myself when the need arises.If you are going to buy one that is this style, this is a good option.",4,One of the most stable products of this type that I've used,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",0.3277
11,A1ZDTRY2VG017E,B00006I9VJ,Martin,"[12, 12]","This arrived just in time for me to take to a therapy group I was doing a presentation at. I was amazed how light it was compared to other wooden or metal easels I've used previously. It was relatively easy for me to fold and unfold and carry and set up. Put your foot on the bottom frame, loosen the tightening knobs, and pull up on both sides of the white board at the same time. Tada! Then tighten into place. Remarkably sturdy! I paid $120 with overnight Prime shipping from Amazon, whereas the identical item was $181 before tax at OfficeMax.

12,A1BJOHHLG0D965,B00006I9VJ,M.D. Edwards Avid Aesthete,"[0, 0]","When I first received this easel/table whiteboard from Quartet, I was stunned by the size of the external, and internal, boxes it came packaged in. There's no shortage of protection used to get this to you safely! Once it's unpacked, as I found the case to be with another whiteboard I recently got from Quartet (theQuartet Matrix Magnetic Modular Whiteboards, 34 Inches x 23 Inches, Silver Aluminum Frame (M3423), it's clear that this is a well-made whiteboard.In order to set it up, it IS quite cumbersome to do solo, so try to enlist the assistance of someone else to help you position the whiteboard exactly as you need to. Quartet has made it so you can angle this whiteboard to many different positions, including setting it up as an actual table (something that I admittedly find to be really daggone cool)! The legs on it are sturdy, and do have a grip on the end of each one to ensure that it stays in place once set up. And the fact that it folds down to about a 4 thickness when you're done with it makes it that much easier to stash it away into a narrow space.For anyone not in need of a permanently mounted whiteboard, that wants something that offers more options for setup and mobility, I can't imagine this board would leave you wanting. Well-designed, smart, worth the price for the features you get! And, oh yeah, it's reversible, too! You just can't beat that! ;)",5,"Great options for using this as a table, or easel, to present information to the masses!",1403740800,"06 26, 2014",0.3569
13,A250AXLRBVYKB4,B00006I9VJ,Nathan Beauchamp ConsumerAdvocate (nathan(at...,"[10, 11]","Aside from one moderate issue, this freestanding dry erase board is great. The only problem with it is that it can be a bit hard to set up without assistance. The knobs that tighten down both the legs and lock the board at the desired angle are hard to turn while also holding everything where you want it. This is solved by laying the board flat on the ground, or by enlisting someone to assist you. Once set up, the board is perfect: stable, easy to write on, made very well, and light. We use three of them at my work place and all are excellent. This board will fit in the trunk of most cars, so it's great for presentations.4/5.

14,AQ6AGWKWMTY8H,B00006I9VJ,PeaTee,"[0, 0]","The Quartet Easel Whiteboard would be a good choice for home offices, homeschoolers, and regular offices.The Whiteboard arrives more or less as one piece. We had to put the endcaps on the pen tray. I don't know whether they came off during shipping or whether the product ships like that, but it wasn't taxing in any sense. Our Whiteboard, by the way, came in it's own box, which was inside of another Amazon box which means that the UPS guy would have had to go out of his way to damage it.The whiteboard/easel is in contracted-mode when it arrives. Don't be like me. All you need to do is pull the whiteboard straight up. For some reason I was thinking it would swing out and lock. Not the case. Just make sure the knobs on the side are not tight, have someone hold the base, and then pull the whiteboard straight up. Tighten knobs. I found that none of us could do this alone. It takes two people.Right now my kids are giving this board a workout. They've used it vertically and they've used it as a table. It worked as a table, but I wouldn't buy this product if that's the main way you plan on using it.Vertically it's been great. My two older kids have been using it and there's been no problem with stability. This might not be the case with little children however, as I know they tend to lean on things and hang on them. I'd advise to keep this product for older kids. Mine are tween and teen.The other use I've put it through is to clip on a large easel paper. We've had no problems. The heavy pad stays put during writing.SUMMARYThe biggest shortfall of this whiteboard/easel is that it takes two people to set it up. But after that it can be moved around, no problem.We've used it as a support for one of those large easel pads with no problem. Also used it as a whiteboard and as a whiteboard table. It's never fallen over.The one other thing you might want to know is that it is tall enough for a small audience. So you could use this in a small office/classroom setting and two or three rows of people, possibly more, would be able to see what you were doing.Recommend.",4,Funtional and Sturdy,1404086400,"06 30, 2014",0.1345
