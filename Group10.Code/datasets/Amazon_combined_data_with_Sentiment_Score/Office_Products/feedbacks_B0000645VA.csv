1,A18U9BQQQ0U8F5,B0000645VA,Grieger,"[2, 2]","I had to replace my trusty TI calculator after 20 years of solid service (I bought it in high school!) recently when the total/equal button started to act up. It was a solar only calculator but it got the job done for years and years.I took a chance on this Sharp and I'm pretty much hooked. By the way, the one I got doesn't match the photo so while the layout and display is the same, the body and the keys are different (more square with an aluminum body and a glass overlay over the top section where the display is). I actually think it looks better than the one shown.Anyway, I primarily use a calculator when doing the bills/finances and sometimes for quick calculations while working (programming...it's easier to do that then actually write up some calculations in a program when the calculations are simple). My biggest concerns are:- Visibility (screen and buttons need to be clear and easy to read from arms length)- Function (I need memory, the usual math, and things like percent and +/- minimum)- Speed/Usability (it shouldn't be slow, of course, and the button organization shouldn't make my life harder)This calculator basically meet all of these challenges with an added bonus or two. The buttons and display are very clear (I think the dark text on lighter buttons actually works better than the pictured light on dark) and I'm already used to tapping things out. I'm a big guy with big fingers but the way this is laid out I never have a problem.The added bonus here is the tax and grand total features. The tax feature lets you set a tax rate and then use +Tax and -Tax buttons to quickly add tax to items (i.e. enter 10 -> hit +Tax => Displays 10.825 for a 8.25% tax rate). Hitting it again will show you how much the tax was (it basically toggles between the total with tax and the tax itself). I don't use this feature nearly enough but if you deal with sales tax or realistically if you deal with a regular percentage (discounts, processing fees) that gets added or removed from a starting value, this feature's for you.The Grand Total feature is another useful one that lets you tally up a series of calculations, like you'd expect, so you can calculate a grand total. You hit the Grand Total button twice then for each calculation hit Grand Total again to rack it up. For example, if you're adding up a number of items, you can multiple the quantity with the unit price and hit the tax button to get a line item total. Then hit Grand Total to add it to the overall total. Do that a few more times then when you've hit Grand Total with the last item you'll have your running tally. This reminds me of my TI's parentheses function where I could do a sub-calculation while stringing together a series of calculations rather than having to jot down or hit memory add. And, sure, this is basically like using memory add (M+) and memory recall (RM) but it feels better/easier since with a single button hit you get the add and the display of the current running total.Overall, I'm really loving this calculator at the moment...assuming it lasts as long, this could be my new TI for the next 20 years. It's definitely slanted towards business and office use but it doesn't have a ton of advanced features that could get in the way for personal or basic school use. It's not a pocket calculator (it's almost the size of a DVD case) though it's light and easy to toss in a brief or backpack.",5,Great calculator,1243036800,"05 23, 2009",0.4619
2,A2EW38Y6PEW0IB,B0000645VA,MM,"[2, 2]","Before the age of checkbook register smartphone apps, I dutifully turned to this calculator to balance my checkbook. I'd tried other calculators, but they were either too small, the keys were too close together, the display too small, or something else made them less than ideal. With this one, it stays in place on my desk, it has a large display, the buttons are laid out intuitively, it goes well with my modern decor, and it has both battery and solar power. This calculator would be good for home of business use, but would not be suitable for a student since it does not come with a case and probably would not stand up to being thrown around in a backpack, locker, or desk.",5,Good basic calculator for desktop use,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",0.2866
