So I have been printing letters, forms, misc type of documents on it and am amazed the brightness of the paper for such a reasonable price! And since I have an HP Printer, I am glad to have paper with HP's endorsement (on the back of the wrapping for this paper, it states that it was actually made by International Paper Company under license of HP). So this paper is made for HP and other quality types of printers, whether HP or another brand.So glad I am using this paper now as in the past, I paid for the generic and cheap types of paper that a brightness of about 88, which is not that good when it is compared to 96 brightness.

In fact, this multipurpose 96 brightness paper by Hewlett Packard gives you something to sing about! I use this paper with my inkjet printers; and I can use it to make signs to tape to my front door indicating to delivery people which doorbell to ring!The paper is not expensive for all that you get; and it almost never jams in my printer at home. Nevertheless, I always fan the paper to make sure that it doesn't jam. After I fan the paper to make sure two pieces of paper aren't stuck to each other, then I place it in my inkjet printer.In addition, this paper can also be used in laser printers, copiers and plain paper fax machine. Each page is a clean cut 8 inches by 11 inches. Great!This paper never goes stale, so stock up on it if you can catch a sale on it. Moreover, this is excellent paper that avoids ink from smearing as it is printed on the page. Great!I don't know what to say about the Amazon price--as of this writing it states that this one ream package costs $12.88. This is either a misprint or maybe you get more than one package for that price; Amazon fails to clarify this. Obviously, however, you shouldn't be paying $12.88 for a single ream of paper. The price may be a misprint or it may be for more than one package; I cannot be sure. Sorry!Use it in good health!",5,all right by me !!!,1188604800,"09 1, 2007",0.2354
