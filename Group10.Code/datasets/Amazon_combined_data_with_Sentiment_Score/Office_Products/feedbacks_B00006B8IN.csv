I need wrist rests because otherwise I get pain and can't use the computer. This one is different in that it is feels like it's coated with plastic wrap rather than fabric. It's very comfortable and best of all my son can't pick at it as he did with the more fabric covered ones. I have hopes that this will last longer. It's firmer than other wrist rests I've used and also a little narrower. Personally I would have liked it to be a little longer and wider, it's the narrowest wrist rest I've ever used, but then again, it also uses less desk space and does the job. Let's see if it lasts the distance.Edited to add, 7 months later it still looks like the first day it did when I took it out, so it's outlasted the past few ones that I've bought, I like the firmness and got used to the narrowness. I would still like it to be a little longer but otherwise very happy with it",4,wrist rest,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",0.3897

It cushions my wrists gently, but firmly, so they don't after a day at the keyboard. I have the matching mouse pad, which is also fantastic for the wrist.I was really surprised that it worked well with the small Mac keyboard. Your hands are in a different position than with PC, but that doesn't seem to impact the effectiveness.Great buy for the price.",5,Works great even with a Mac keyboard,1230854400,"01 2, 2009",0.4576

I also own a wireless Knicks keyboard which leans against the wrist rest so I don't have to worry about it shuffling around.,5,"The color is royal blue, not light blue!",1403568000,"06 24, 2014",0.3935
