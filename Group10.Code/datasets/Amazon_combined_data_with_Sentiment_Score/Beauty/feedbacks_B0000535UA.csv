I don't then obviously recommend it for oily hair otherwise it's okay. If you want better check my other reviews. It definantly adds extra ingrediants unlike free and clear which some may prefer- but, I don't.",3,Works but isn't the best!,1224460800,"10 20, 2008",0.1779

It does relieve my sore head better than regular shampoo. I bounce around my shampoo routine with different shampoos for psorais because it seams to work better, (for me).I do like dermarest, and Paul Mitchell tea tree shampoo as well.",3,It's better than most,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",0.4575

After a couple weeks of using it my scalp was no longer itchy (at all) and the flakes went away. It also has a very nice scent. Although it does leave my hair a bit dry, you just need to use a good conditioner and you're all set. I ran out and I had some head & shoulders stored so I used that. Head & Shoulders really sucks compared to the Jason brand. Once my Head & Shoulders is all gone I am going to go back to Jason and stick with it!

It also has a &#34;fresh&#34; smell. It does not smell like tea or mint. However, it is a little on the &#34;runny&#34; side for shampoo and may leave a little &#34;dustiness&#34; to your hair. I'm not sure if it just makes my hair attract dust, if it's shampoo residue. It's not noticeable unless you examine your hair under a microscope - which i do.",3,So much cheaper online,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",0.0215

I purchased this shampoo to use on occasion to prevent the itchy scalp it seems to cause. Plus, I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree shampoos.Let me just say, I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product. It has a horrible chemical odor...EXACTLY like pesticide. I tried a few more times to stomach it, but just can't do it. Plus, you would think it would at least tingle a bit, with it smelling like Raid and all, but nope; NADA.Also, if you are looking for a shampoo that is organic with no SLS...READ THE LABEL! This product is not what it is marketed to be.",1,Not what I expected :(,1332201600,"03 20, 2012",0.0036

It is paraben-free, and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates. The scent is not as refreshing as the scent of Jason Natural Cosmetics - Satin Shower Body Wash/Tea Tree Oil 30 fl oz Gel, which is a fabulous body wash, but it is not a bad scent. You do need to watch that it doesn't get in your eyes, since tea tree oil can sting a bit.",4,Pleasant Shampoo,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",0.321

I used to have a flaky itchy hair scalp but not since using it, nor have I had any lice and my hair is soft and fuller. I've gotten LOTS of compliments about my beautiful hair which I never comb or brush because i'm too busy & lazy to fix my hair. It smells kind of mediciny (because of the tea tree oil) and very liquidy so I mix it with a nice fragrance shampoo like pomegranate, berry, etc or fragrant shower gel with a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of jason shampoo to other shampoo.I RUB IT WELL into even the deepest parts of my hair and onto my scalp and LEAVE IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE in my hair while bathing for the best results.Be careful, though, the drawback is that it DOES sting and burn (because of the tea tree oil) when you leave it on very long. Oh well.....no pain, no gain!!Great product even if it does sting.",5,well healthful shampoo,1322611200,"11 30, 2011",0.2753
