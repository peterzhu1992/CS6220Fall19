Beer Books & Belongings By Beverly ...,"[1, 1]","I was using regular antibacterial soaps and my hands were always dry and chapped and cracked until my dermatologist recommended using Cetaphil products and changing detergents (free and clear), changing creams (sensitive skin and fragrance free only). Now, my hands are clean and moisturized. This soap (and Cetaphil products for that matter) are awesome! You'll notice the difference right away.",5,Gets the job done,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",0.4866

2,A287DGXK7D6NX7,B000052YKY,A. Roberts,"[2, 2]","Being thirty, I have tried everything for my combination sometimes dryer in the winter skin! I am prone to breakouts even before that time of the month. I am even more prone to breakouts when using harsh cleansers or even changing products to frequently. In the past year I have received four big cystic acne bumps and I am still trying to recoup from the scarring. After reading all of the better reviews about Cetaphil products and googling at the Cetaphil products at my local drugstore but opting for the fancier more expensive, well known facial cleansers - I am here to say that Cetaphil is the one brand that I trust most when it comes to my face and the rest of my bod! Being more concerned with my somewhat sensitive skin (After stepping out of the shower and sudsing my face with yet another harsh cleanser or even my shower bar of soap, my face was beet RED!) I have read that using a benzoyl peroxide zit cream or even benzoyl peroxide as an ingredient in a cleanser will kill that bacteria on your face which that nasty bacteria can lead to breakouts! So when I spotted this bar of cleanser that stated it was antibacterial (without benzoyl peroxide which on the bad side will cause early signs of aging on your skin - Bleh!!!) I have tested and tried it, even sometimes alternating with Cetaphil facial cleanser and what a difference! My skin this past week has never been in such better shape nor clearer! I am sticking to this and for 4 bucks I recommend trying it out for those of you who are prone to breakouts and cystic acne. Give it a shot like I did you may never go back to your regular acne cleanser!",5,Great Cleansing Bar to Keep Breakouts at Bay!,1201996800,"02 3, 2008",-0.0259

4,A265PCQZA1Y1WF,B000052YKY,Jeffrey A Jeff,"[2, 2]","Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar is indeed the optimum choice for my problem skin.This pH balance non-soap cleansing bar is a super gentle all over body wash. I even use it on my face in lieu of shaving cream - it's that soothing! The antibacterial ingredient - triclosan, also helps protect my freshly shaved face.CONS:This stuff's priceyCetaphil Antibacterial Cleansing Bar is very soft and it melts away quickly once it's under the shower stream.TIP: To reduce wastage of this pricey cleansing bar, don't lather up under the shower, lather up your washcloth instead and store your Cetaphil Cleansing Bar away from the shower (I keep mine in a covered soap dish).Shop around on Amazon ... this product offers a few buying choices.Hope my review was helpful ...

5,A2EBR70V6P9W0N,B000052YKY,karhill54 karhill54,"[7, 7]","I really have only one complaint; so far as I can tell, in essentials, this bar cleanser is much the same as it ever was, but I could SWEAR that the bar I used several years ago was fragrance-free. I know I would never have even tried it if it had smelled like this then. I mean, part of the Cetaphil brand's selling point is that its skincare products have no fragrance added to them that would irritate sensitive skin. So why does this Cetaphil product have any fragrance at all?I usually have no problems with lightly-scented skincare products, provided they are only LIGHTLY scented. I'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients, but I still have to avoid most of them because for me, strong perfumes set off major migraines. Other than that, some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice. But this... THIS was like my worst nightmare of every ancient, long-expired bottle of old-lady perfume dumped into a single bar. It's intolerable. I couldn't even just throw it away; it still stunk up the whole bathroom from the bathroom trash can. I ended up taking it straight outside to the dumpster. And I still had to empty the half-full bathroom garbage to get rid of that sickening, cloying, unbearable scent that sparked off a 2-day migraine.Maybe I'm just missing something obvious. I would appreciate it if someone could let me know IF Cetaphil still makes a fragrance-free bar soap/cleanser. I'd like to go back to using an old favorite, but I can't find the old favorite.",1,What happened to the Cetaphil bar I used to know and love?,1360454400,"02 10, 2013",0.0005
