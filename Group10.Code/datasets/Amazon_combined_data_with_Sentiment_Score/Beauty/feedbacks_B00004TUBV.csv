There are several different labels included in the package, including a blank one, in case you want to fill it with lotion instead of body wash, or whatever.The mirror is rather small, but useful for checking your brows or, if you're a dude, your facial-shave job. It doesn't steam up, there may be a coating? Or I'm just getting lucky :)The flat shelf are on the top is useful for holding your razor, while the many hooks on the bottom help organize the scrubbies and loofas that seem to overwhelm the bathroom shelves normally.My only wish is that it's just a bit smaller, as the whole thing is maybe 14-18 inches across, which is a lot of visual space!",4,"Daughter loves it, husband hates it",1403308800,"06 21, 2014",0.5526

We used a level, and we know this is even, but this still happens. Love the mirror, and now I can't live without the shower mirror. I loved using this to clean up the shower.",4,Only one complaint,1344211200,"08 6, 2012",0.3177

The only thing is that it couldn't dispense a very creaming expensive conditioner. So I had to dilute it with water to work. Which I didn't like doing..otherwise, this was perfect. But the mirror still fogged. Lol..",5,Awesome,1357430400,"01 6, 2013",0.2289
4,AY1EF0GOH80EK,B00004TUBV,Natasha Stryker,"[0, 0]","I have this in our guest bathroom shower and it is perfect. The bottles hold only about 2/3 of the full size one I have in our master bath, but that is fine since the occasional use it gets doesn't facilitate a lot of refilling. I loath those wire shelving units for showers so I was so excited to find this and have everything off the floor and kept together for easy use in such a tidy little package.This comes with the silicone adhesive AND a few squares of adhesive foam backing, the idea is you spread the silicone on and the adhesive foam squares hold it in place while it dries. You have to wait 24 hours before filling the bottles to allow the silicone glue to cure. I have one of these in my master bath for 3 years without budging so it is a very strong hold.",5,Works great in small guest shower,1353801600,"11 25, 2012",0.4758
