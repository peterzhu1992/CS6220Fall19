This smells like a sweet, decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I'm not sure what else, but it smells great! Although, I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle! You could get the 2.7 oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus (the 1.7 oz for around $80 if you prefer a smaller bottle)!",5,Love the smell of this!,1316390400,"09 19, 2011",0.4434

I absolutely love Prada Candy, I have worn it everyday since I bought it- I practically ditched all my other fragrances!!! It is a far cry from the Prada infusion d'Iris...and all the other Prada fragrances. They got it right this time..... Like everyone has said, it's a warm and sweet smell but it doesn't last long...I practically douse myself in it!! I guess the only solution is to spritz this over and over (rather cumbersome!! I know, but hey, no other solution in sight), or better-still layer it if they decide to introduce its body lotion or body cream into the market. One other thing that I wish they'd change is the spritzer thingy ( I don't know what it's called )- it's not very reliable in my opinion as you could easily pull it off in trying to figure out how it's used. Otherwise, it's a great fragrance and I love it.",5,Lurrrrrrrrv.....,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",0.2066
