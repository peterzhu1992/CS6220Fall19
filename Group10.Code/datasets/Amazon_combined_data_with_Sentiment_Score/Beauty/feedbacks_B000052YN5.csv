1,A1RK0SXW6MU33Y,B000052YN5,Fairy,"[0, 0]","I have been using moisturizer from all stretches of the earth. NuSkin to dead sea to japanese products to Exuviance. This one moisturizes very well. The thing about less-expensive moisturizers are that they do the same job, but they are thicker. I have been having drier skin, overall after using this for a year, so I'm not sure if the long term benefits are good. My skin looks older but I don't think it is due to this product or just aging. This product is a bit too much for summertime, if you have an oily/shiny t-zone.",4,Works as good as most high-end lotions.,1399420800,"05 7, 2014",0.028
2,AKZY31R5NGWR3,B000052YN5,G. Grenon,"[0, 0]","I have sensitive skin and combination at that. I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer. But I decided to try other brands so save some money. After several attempts on different brands. I found this gem! Diamond in the rough! It lasts me a long time and I have no reaction to it. I only hope they don't discontinue it any time soon because I really don't want to find another one and chances are, it will be much more expensive. At this price you should definitely try this.",5,Wonderful moisturizer and affordable!,1388534400,"01 1, 2014",0.1967

6,A1IIY5JHWE8R95,B000052YN5,LittleRobinRed,"[1, 1]","This moisturizer is OK, but I find it a little greasy. If I use it very sparingly it's not too bad, and I think the oil does soak in after it's been on your face for a while. Overall, about the same as most other lotions of this type. Will probably try something different next time.",3,ambivalent,1313625600,"08 18, 2011",0.1077

Cause me to break out and made my roseaca flare up. I could probably use this as a cream for my hands when going to the beach but that's about it.,1,Face cream,1357171200,"01 3, 2013",-0.0585
