0,A2RJQK0WT4FZ8L,B00005321Z,Ana,"[1, 1]","I have some dry patches no moisturizer seemed to be able to control over the course of a day. I know this is a night cream, however, I've been using it in the day mixed in with my sunblock and it lasts all day. I haven't seen those dry patches in the last month or so since I started using it. I don't know about wrinkle control just yet but I does work very well for me as a moisturizer. It does have a scent to it, I don't consider it offensive but I grew up in a time when most beauty products had some scent to them some more than others so I don't mind it. It doesn't linger.",4,Works for my very dry skin in a very dry climate,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",0.1651
1,A28BSV6KDF862D,B00005321Z,G. Lilly,"[2, 2]",I read the rave reviews about using it for years through many generations and the benefits of using it. I am in my early 50's so I wanted to get rid of forehead wrinkles and facial lines. I think I got better results in Ponds. This rich cream may need to sit on the face at night but I don't do night creams-messy. It seems it blends in nicely with a little moderate rubbing but I just didn't notice much difference in my apperance. It's just ok with me not bad and not great.,3,It's ok,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",0.2617

3,A3AA16P5KV8X41,B00005321Z,Sharon Jacobs,"[0, 0]","I love this face cream. I Have used it for decades. It is just the right creaminess for dry facial skin. It has a pleasant smell, but not too fragrant. It lasts a long time and the price is very reasonable. It only takes a tiny little bit once a day - under make up or at night. Try it. Your face will love you for it.",5,Very Nice Product,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",0.1948

No mater how little I used or how much I tried to rub/pat it into my skin, there was a greasy layer on my skin. When I woke up in the morning, my skin wasn't particularly soft or hydrated. It has an &#34;old lady&#34; scent and just seemed very &#34;old school&#34; to me., Like something my grandmother would use. There are better products out there for my money.",1,Not a modern formula,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",0.1011
