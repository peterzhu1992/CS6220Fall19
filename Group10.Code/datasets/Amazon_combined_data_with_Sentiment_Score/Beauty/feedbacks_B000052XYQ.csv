I have Seborrheic dermatitis and years of Head & Shoulders never did a bit of difference. This is golden.

3,A39ULNFL84RCKV,B000052XYQ,So Cal Linda,"[1, 1]",Really like this shampoo because hair feels extremely clean and stays clean longer than most shampoos I've used. Fragrance free is a must for me and this product couldn't be better. Highly recommend.,5,Great shampoo,1351555200,"10 30, 2012",0.4873
4,A1D7BE64YN2U66,B000052XYQ,VickiO VOS,"[3, 3]",The product works great and my skin allergy from normal shampoos is gone. My hair looks great with this shampoo. The shampoo arrived on time and it was packaged well by the shipper. DHS might consider putting no spill flaps on the neck opening under the top. There was some leakage from shipping.,5,DHS Clear Shampoo,1238716800,"04 3, 2009",0.2841
