It seems to prepare your skin by sanitizing it (i.e. with alcohol), and making it easier for the blades/foil to glide over your skin. Good stuff and it lasts quite a while.",5,makes shaving with electric better,1248134400,"07 21, 2009",0.3208
1,A5KVTBI8FA961,B000052Y6Z,Houston Guy Daniel Hughes,"[0, 1]",I had never used this item before. My father used to use it all the time. Now I see why. It really does give you a closer shave and reduces skin irritation. You only need to use a small amount. And make sure to wait about 15 seconds for it to dry before shaving.,5,A Great Item To Use With Electric Shavers,1365897600,"04 14, 2013",-0.0321
2,A1SQW9H85UVYNU,B000052Y6Z,izzy,"[0, 0]","I'm a lady, and I bought this because I needed a quick, in-office fix to fuzzy legs. Sometimes you miss a patch. Or the whole thing...Anyway, I did a side by side comparison. One leg I shaved dry and one I used this stuff.This stuff works great, I had a much closer, smoother shave than without it. But, it made me smell like an old man. It has a very potent 'classic aftershave' smell that is just not my cup of tea, as a lady who doesn't want to smell like a great uncle, or for someone I would consider getting close enough to to smell their face.Now I understand why it says 'rinse after using'. That being said, it's still a great product, and I'd buy it again.",4,Grandpa?,1399939200,"05 13, 2014",0.3354
3,A21FO8HXJECL08,B000052Y6Z,WILLIAM WOOD,"[1, 1]","Williams Lectric Shave Electric Razor Pre-Shave Original, 3 fl oz, definately makes an annoying choir a little easier. I've never been a huge fan of electric razors, because I haven't found any brand that gives me as good a shave as I get from even a cheap blade. Its been my personal experience that most electric shavers leave lots of stuble and it's hard to get a clean shave under the chin and throat area. For me, it usually requires more time to get a clean shave with an electric razor than is required when using a disposable razor. Williams Lectric Shave allows me to get a smoother shave when using an electric, but its smell, while not offensive, is almost overpowering.Please rate this review if you found it helpful.",3,Smoother Shave..,1349308800,"10 4, 2012",0.4348
4,A3VLTT45T236B,B000052Y6Z,W. Taylor,"[11, 16]","Williams Lectirc Shave is a great product that has served men's electric shaving needs for several decades! BUT DON'T buy it here! WHY? I didn't pay close enough attention to the prices vs weight and when it arrived I was really angry! This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $2.50, NOT $5.62!!! For $5.48 - $5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain. DON'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER!! YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE. RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!",1,RIP OFF! DON'T BUY THIS FINE PRODUCT HERE!!!,1381276800,"10 9, 2013",0.0094
