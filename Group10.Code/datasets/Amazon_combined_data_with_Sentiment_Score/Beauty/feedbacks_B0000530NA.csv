1,A21XESIGA3ADU3,B0000530NA,Jeneine,"[1, 1]","It deep cleans without stripping my skin. It doesn't make my skin produce more oil because too much has been removed. After use, my skin is able to be moisturized. I've used other toners and this is by far my favorite.",5,wonderful,1375315200,"08 1, 2013",0.1147

3,AUFB3GQJV10P0,B0000530NA,LMOND00,"[1, 1]",I used the toner today after doing an at home facial and OMG it smells good first of all. I didn't expect that because I never thought to smell it once it arrived. It goes on soothingly and refreshes the skin. I'm glad I purchased this product.,5,Great toner,1300060800,"03 14, 2011",0.2248
4,A2YLULZ4BTA4MA,B0000530NA,S. WILSON SUSAN A*K*A CUPCAKE,"[5, 6]",I TRYED AT LEAST TWO TONERS BEFORE AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS!! IT MAKES YOUR FACE SO REFRESHING AND CALM AFTER YOU WASH YOUR FACE. IT FEELS LIKE COLD WATER WITH SOOTHING ELEMENTS IN. PLUS IT'S NOT OILY LIKE MOST TONERS AS WELL. AND IT'S GREAT FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN.AND DRY OR COMBINATION AS WELL. I USE THIS WITH MY OLAY FOAMING FACE WASH FOR SENSITIVE SKIN. THEN MY ZAYPT ZIT GREAT TRIO. BUT I HAVE ACNE PRONE AND THIS CALMS THE ACNE DOWN PERFECT. AND NOT OILY SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR FACE GETTING LIKE A OIL BUCKET. IT'S ALSO VERY CHEAP THEN LOTS OF TONERS SO DON'T THINK THE PRICE IS LOW CAUSE THE PRODUCT IS BAD. THE BEST OF THINGS COME IN LOW PRICES AND PACKAGES!! LOL THANKS AGAIN OLAY!!,5,BEST TONER!(*)!,1244678400,"06 11, 2009",0.3424
