1,A1L5P841VIO02V,1881509818,Jason A. Kramer,"[1, 1]","I had a factory Glock tool that I was using for my Glock 26, 27, and 17. I've since lost it and had needed another. Since I've used Ghost products prior, and know that they are reliable, I had decided to order this one. Sure enough, this is just as good as a factory tool.",5,Works as well as the factory tool,1328140800,"02 2, 2012",0.0001
2,AB2W04NI4OEAD,1881509818,J. Fernald,"[2, 2]","If you don't have a 3/32 punch or would like to have one in your Glock bag, this is okay. The butt end of it is handy for pushing pins back in place. If you already have a 3/32 punch and don't need another, don't both with this one.",4,"It's a punch, that's all.",1330387200,"02 28, 2012",0.1756

Actually, I think you would be better with a regular punch as it has more to hold on to.",4,It's a punch with a Glock logo.,1328400000,"02 5, 2012",0.0496
4,AAAWJ6LW9WMOO,1881509818,Material Man,"[0, 0]","I purchased this thinking maybe I need a special tool to easily pop off my base plates for my magazines, but it does the same as a regular punch tool. Glock mags are a pain to get the base plates off. The tool does not really make a difference.",4,"Ok,tool does what a regular punch does.",1366675200,"04 23, 2013",-0.0463
5,A2XX2A4OJCDNLZ,1881509818,RatherLiveInKeyWest,"[0, 0]","Needed this tool to really break down my G22, and it works perfectly for that. No difference from OEM I suspect.However, had an added bonus when realizing that I needed a punch to properly disassemble the bolt carrier in my AR for a thorough cleaning, and this tool worked perfectly to push the carrier's retaining pin out and then back into place after the job was completed. Excellent! It is now in my range bag for safe keeping.",5,Glock punch tool - needed for your Glock and other applications too,1351814400,"11 2, 2012",0.6117
