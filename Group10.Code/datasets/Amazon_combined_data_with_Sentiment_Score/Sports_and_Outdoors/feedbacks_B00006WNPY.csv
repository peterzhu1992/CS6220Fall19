Granted it's not the most expensive unit out there but it should last more than a month.I did like it's size and it was fairly unobtrustive and not hard to program or read (that gives it the extra star)As for measuring steps it is not as accurate as I wanted anyway. When compared to the treadmill and elliptical machines, both of which give readouts of what you've done in your workout, this unit did not count all my steps. I wore it on the belt area/top of waist. It may be that mine was a dud and the battery was going from the beginning which is why the step count was off - but it really doesn't matter. I'm going to purchase a much better quality unit in the hopes it will last longer! I cannot possibly recommend this unit - although it does sound like others have had better experiences.",2,As with some othes I got LOW battery life - 1 month ONLY!,1299542400,"03 8, 2011",0.1567
1,A1F8S84KX7PMF9,B00006WNPY,Eviebarbi,"[0, 2]","I thought this had a heart monitor. SMALL Display. The Calorie Burnt Counter is Kcal vs regular calories. I ran on the treadmill and compared my Calories burned and Distance and it was VERY OFF! Overall the pedometer said I only burned 83 kcal I ran for 30 mins and walked for 15 mins = 45 mins total in which the treadmill stated I burned 400 Calories. You must also calculate the kcal according to your age, but my results did not come close to the treadmill measurements. Dissapointed. I bought this because of the reviews on how accurate it is. But it's not. Have you compared it to something else? a bike or a treadmill?",1,Not Accurate for Running,1312761600,"08 8, 2011",0.0
2,A28BSV6KDF862D,B00006WNPY,G. Lilly,"[3, 4]","Well, when I first got it I thought I could just run to the gym once the battery was activated. Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count steps or miles IMO. I did want something a little simpler for life.",3,Nice but little complicated,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",0.2409
3,A3H6Z7OPWAMWB,B00006WNPY,JimmyKeepCool,"[1, 1]","For just counting steps while walking, this is a decent product. However, it is not totally accurate if you go running. Also, car rides can sometimes increase your step count is the road is a bit too bumpy.The setting for measuring distance is not accurate at all, but I don't really mind.The belt clip is sturdy. I haven't had any problems with it breaking or the pedometer falling off.Also, this pedometer is definitely purple. I'm not sure why they labeled it as blue when it is without a doubt purple.",3,"Not bad, but nothing special.",1313193600,"08 13, 2011",0.1447
4,A1KLPS6P7UR631,B00006WNPY,Karl Bielefeldt,"[12, 12]","This pedometer has a clock which resets the count every day and keeps a seven day history. I just leave it on my belt and don't have to worry about resetting it or checking it right after a walk. My wife has a pedometer with manual reset and she never remembers to use it.The sensitivity adjustment helps avoid false readings from car vibrations, and the aerobic steps feature is useful to determine how much exercise I'm actually getting.It is very durable. I've worn it every day for over a year with no problems. It also has a small enough size that I hardly notice when I'm wearing it.In summary, the combination of durability, features, size, and price makes the Omron HJ-105 an excellent choice.",5,Seven day history makes sure I use it,1172880000,"03 3, 2007",0.279
5,AY687CJMS8J6G,B00006WNPY,Robert Living in Paradise,"[3, 3]","It was very difficult to write a review for this product. On one hand, it performs well and is well worth its price. On the other hand, it has a cheap feel to it and it is a bit clumsy (inconvenient) to use. Bottom line: I wish I had paid the few extra dollars for the Omron HJ-112, which probably would have met my expectations better.",4,Omron HJ-105 Pedometer,1178064000,"05 2, 2007",0.3176
