Drove it around the driveway and everything worked great. We get to our destination and go to hook it up and the tubes are BLOWN. Actually shredded looking in spots. We were way up north and spent over an hour in the car to find a town big enough that had a store that sold bike supplies. Once both tubes were replaced the trailer worked great. Very easy to put together. I couldn't figure out how to attach it to the bike but that isn't my area. My husband had it attached in less then 2 minutes. The rubber on the original tube was very thin, I'm surprised more haven't blown.",3,Blown tubes!,1275264000,"05 31, 2010",0.2072

Our grandson is now old enough so I took him for a little ride yesterday, he loved it!Yes, I'm sure you can spend a lot more money and get a better one, but this works just fine. Easy to put together, easy to attach to my bike (I attached it to an old mtn bike instead of my road bike)attaches very easy and seems very secure.Pulls easily enough and holds Will in place ... what more can you ask for for this price?",5,Great little trailer!,1271376000,"04 16, 2010",0.5512

Easy access to storage area and opening and closing cover.CONS: My only complaint is the restraint system. It feels kid of cheap and looks uncomfortable for the kids riding. Straps need improvement.Overall I am glad about this purchase. Recommended.",4,Great for the Price,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",0.2294

4,A3GMRYV7VAYK5Q,B00006JHVN,Georgia Mom,"[127, 130]","We got this to use as both a bike carrier and a double stroller. Putting it together was SUPER EASY since it comes mostly assembled. It is bit tight for 2 kids though, a 4 year old and 2 year old. Because the seat is not firm they tend to slide together and then fight because they are pushed up against each other. It attaches easily to a bike but be warned there is alot of drag almost like pulling a parachute. I am guessing every carrier would have this issue though. As a stoller it is very easy to manuever and push. There is some storage behind the seat and that adds to its convenience.",4,We love it,1176076800,"04 9, 2007",0.1045
5,A1P0JSFW184ZXJ,B00006JHVN,Jen Geek Girl,"[104, 108]","To be honest, I really wanted a Burley trailer for my kids and I do even more now after having dealt with the Quick N EZ trailer for a year. Our first trailer we got for $25 at a garage sale. It was also InStep but I don't see that they make this style any longer. It had a hard plastic base as opposed to the canvas most (if not all) trailers are made of these days. My son would slip and slide all over. After just a few minutes of biking with no suspension and no seats, he'd be slumped down with the straps around his neck.Needless to say, I wasn't going to make him endure that any longer! So we picked up the Quick and EZ for $80. We were pleased with how easy it was to set up and how quickly it folded down, though it still wasn't small enough to fit in the trunk of our Grand Prix. We now have a Sienna so it's no longer an issue, but my son's comfort was immediately a factor from the first time he was put in it. The hammock-style seat is straight up in the back, so when he falls asleep he just slumps over and looks very uncomfortable.Not only that, but the airflow inside the trailer is a HUGE concern for me. After 10 minutes of biking in 80ish degree weather, he is beet red and soaked in sweat. Now, he is not in direct sunlight so that's not what's heating him up. It's that because the hammock seat is canvas and because the seat effectively goes from wall to wall inside the trailer, there is nowhere for the air to go, even though there is a vent in the back of the trailer. We started putting him in shorts and nothing else to try to keep him comfortable but he still gets extremely hot. How can I enjoy my ride when I know he is miserable?And you can forget about putting two kids in this thing unless they're very easy-going and don't mind being squished together. When I was a daycare mom, I would regularly take my son and one of our daycare kids who was only 4 days younger than my son and about the same build, and the first few times they did nothing but fight! Sure they were two 2-year-olds, but can you blame them? The hammock seat forced them to lean into each other and make them even MORE hot! Would you really enjoy riding in the car if you were pressed up against the person in the seat beside you the entire time? Not likely!Aside from that major complaint, I do have to complain that the small wheels and lack of suspension make for a very bumpy ride and I also feel bad subjecting my kids to that. Also, it would be nice if you could only partially lower the sun shade to keep your baby protected. When we're going in the wrong direction, he always gets sun on his thighs and sometimes even his arms if the sun is high. We always put sunscreen on of course, but if I'm going to expect him to sit in there while I bike for two hours, I'd like to make sure he's comfortable.So, all complaints aside, the trailer has one big plus. It's price. You can't beat the price, but you get what you pay for. This summer I am seriously considering spending one of my bonus checks to get my son a wonderful Burley trailer. Yes, it's $450 and probably not practical if you only bike once in a while, but seeing as we bike daily in warm weather and sometimes 2-3 times a day, I think the price is justified to make sure he enjoys it as much as I do. Burley trailers come with large wheels with suspension, a roll bar, PADDED BUCKET SEATS!! with mesh on the upper part to allow for good airflow, and padded seatbelts.Yep, definitely getting a Burley this year! I've waited long enough! ;)",2,"Not great, but it's cheap!",1203379200,"02 19, 2008",0.1878
6,A1WBEIH7Z37LN9,B00006JHVN,MagicSkip magicskip,"[0, 0]","I've got two little guys under four years old, and I pull one or the other, sometimes BOTH in this trailer. It works.The GOOD parts: It folds up FLAT and fits in my hatchback. It is EASY to fold up or reassemble (about two minutes). The fabric is more durable than I expected. It pulls easily -- on flats or downhills, I barely notice it at all. On uphills... well, it's extra weight, and that means more work, but I can't blame that on the trailer! The trailer itself is reasonably light and it doesn't have much rolling-resistance. It's stable -- even when my bike fell over, the trailer stayed upright! It has a trunk - a storage area behind the kids' seat, for lunch, jackets, whatever - I'd like to try it for camping sometime! AND, with the front wheel and push handle, it doubles as a double-stroller! Very convenient!The BAD parts: The snaps rusted. Even with the windscreen closed, it still gets full of sand and road grit, which means the little guys get some of that, too. When you roll up the screens, it needs some velcro to hold them in place, because the elastic doesn't do it. The two boys are side-by-side with no separation, so they can push and shove each other. The tires are difficult to inflate. The front wheel doesn't turn (steer) smoothly.The bottom line is that you can't beat this trailer in this price range. Sure, there are better, but they cost WAY more.",5,"Easy to use, easy to pull, GREAT value!",1252281600,"09 7, 2009",0.1055

The construction of the unit is decent and has held up well.----The trailer is really easy to set up - five minutes if you have a quick release for the back wheel of the host bike. The ride is pleasant (meaning very smooth) for both the parent and child. Like others have mentioned, the toddler loves their personal space. Plenty of whees when we coast down hills.I envision after my toddler out grows the trailer that I can use it for running errands.This is a non-brainer purchase.",5,My two year old won't get out!,1153353600,"07 20, 2006",0.4621
