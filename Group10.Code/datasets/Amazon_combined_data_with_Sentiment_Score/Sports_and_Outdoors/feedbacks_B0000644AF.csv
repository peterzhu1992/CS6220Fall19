Later: I've had this for over a year now and still amazed at how it keeps drinks cool.

I purchased two of these Thermos can insulators, one for me, and one for a friend. They have not disappointed. I've not done any scientific tests on the performance of these can insulators, but they keep a beer cold on a 100+ day as long as you'd need to drink it.Another benefit to the stainless steel construction of the Thermos can insulator when compared to a traditional foam koozie is that the Thermos can insulator is much easier to clean. While a foam koozie will eventually get wet, and sometimes take on a moldy smell, the Thermos can insulator obviously doesn't absorb water, and can easily be washed in the sink with some soap and water.My only complaint about the Thermos can insulator is that the rubber ring around the top comes off quite easily. So easily, in fact, that I ended up losing mine while dove hunting one day. The can insulator still works in the absence of the rubber ring, but the can will flop around a bit more since it doesn't have a tight seal around the top. I'd almost be tempted to use some electrical tape around the bottom of the ring to attach it to the stainless steel if I were to ever purchase another one.Overall, I'd recommend the Thermos can insulator to anyone wanting to keep a 12oz can cold. Be prepared, though, since this thing is a bit of a conversation starter, and all your friends will want one too.",4,Works well,1357516800,"01 7, 2013",0.4446

8,A2Q7DE6NA7VKAJ,B0000644AF,Daniel M. Hart,"[0, 0]","Thermos Stainless Steel Can Insulator 2700P, by Thermos.This insulated stainless can and bottle holder will keep your beers and sodas cold for at least an hour. Starting with a 12 ounce can of beer at 33 degrees, and a 16.9 ounce plastic bottle of soda also at 33 degrees, I put each of them in a room temperature 76 degree Thermos insulated holder, and left them unopened. After an hour, both the beer and soda had warmed up some, the bottle of Coca-Cola was at 48 degrees when opened, and the can of Budweiser beer was at 36 degrees when opened. I usually keep my holders upside down in the refrigerator, on top of soda bottles to save space. I also keep a gel insulated holder in the freezer, with the shape maintained by an empty beer can. Replacing the soda bottle cap will keep the fizz in the soda, but if a can of beer is left opened for more than an hour, it will start to lose its fizz and go flat. How many people leave a can of beer open for more than an hour if they plan on drinking it? In the hot sun, any drink is better than no drink, but indoors, you might just dump it and start over,-depending of course on how many beers you have already had. After a few beers, you may not even notice how cold the beer is. (-;In the future, I will update this review on how well the beer and soda stay cold when the holder is also stored in the refrigerator. This item is expensive, but well made. As a future improvement, I think that the rubber collar should be extended the length of the can, to improve the grip, and to further insulate the can by isolating the heat sink metal sides from the influence of warm hands. Four stars for this can holder.03/25/14 Update. Just for giggles, I tried the test again, this time with the holders kept in the door of the refrigerator, alongside the 12 oz. can of beer and the 16.9 oz. plastic bottle of Coca-Cola. They all started out in the refrigerator at a temperature of 33 degrees. After being placed in the holders, both of them sat unopened on a table for one hour at a room temperature of 76 degrees, and the opened can of beer was at 38 degrees, and the opened bottle of soda was at 51 degrees, probably due to the fact that the top 2 1/2 of the bottle and its soda were above the top of the insulating holder, while only 5/8 of the beer can was above its holder.Strange as it seems, the beer and soda both did a little better in a room temperature holder than in a refrigerated holder. Whodathunkit. This was not a controlled scientific experiment, but I tried to control the variables the best I could so that I could compare the results. If anyone can explain why this same thing happened with both the hard rubber holders I reviewed on 03/24/14, and these metal stainless steel holders as well, please leave a comment. The hard rubber holders had about a 2 degree difference between the can and bottle, while the stainless holders had a 12.5 degree(48&36;51&38) difference between the can and bottle. The difference between the hard rubber and stainless for the beer can was 11.5 degrees(48&36;49&38), while the average temperature for the bottle was 50 degrees (48,50,51,51) for both the hard rubber and the stainless holders. So for the plastic bottle, it doesn't seem to make a difference what type of holder you use. For the beer can, the stainless holder was a clear winner over the hard rubber holder, with an average temperature of 37(36,38) for the stainless holder and an average temperature of 48.5(48,49) for the hard rubber holder.A beer still cold at 37 degrees after an hour? Hard to beat that! These stainless holders are excellent.Next up, placing the holders in a freezer.04/18/14 Update. The freezer test. I started out with the stainless steel holders in a freezer at a temperature of -8 degrees. The 12 ounce can of Budweiser and the 16.9 ounce plastic bottle of Coca-Cola were in the refrigerator at 32 degrees, and the ambient room temperature was 76 degrees. After one hour of sitting unopened, the Budweiser was at 36 degrees, and the Coca-Cola was at 44 degrees. The soda was 4 degrees cooler than in the previous cooler at room temperature test, and the beer, at 36 degrees, was about the same as in previous tests, and exactly the same as the stainless cooler in the room temperature test. In this test, there was a 12 degree difference between the coldness of the beer and the soda, about the same as in previous tests. It does not appear that freezing or cooling the stainless cooler is any improvement over using a room temperature stainless cooler when keeping a can of beer cold, and at best, only a 4 degree improvement in keeping a plastic bottle of soda cold. I can't think of any more tests to run on this cooler, and about all there is left to say is: buy it!Sold by Corydor and Fulfilled by Amazon. Manufactured by: THERMOS L.L.C., 2550 W.

I have noticed that the rubber ring around the top of the can has started to loosen up a bit. I was thinking of adding some glue to keep it in place, but silicone glue might not dry without exposure to air, so I might use some rubber cement on both the can and rubber ring, let the glue dry, and then place the ring in its proper position. If anyone knows of a better glue to use, please leave a comment. Thermos should extend the rubber ring all the way to the bottom of the can, including the bottom as well, so the metal holder doesn't have any way of slipping out and landing on the floor.",4,"Even with The Can Holder At Room Temperaure, Canned And Bottled Drinks Will Stay Very Cold For At Least An Hour.",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",0.1502
9,AWJCL1N4MW3G0,B0000644AF,JayJay Bovie Muff,"[0, 0]",Anybody would think anything that insulates would be thick but this thing adds very little overall thickness. It fits the drink holders in my 2011 Mazda 3 with plenty of room to spare. Not only that you can keep change in your holder and due to the rubber bottom on this there's no jingling compared to the can sitting on the coins themselves.It insulates very well but my major reason for the purchase was to prevent the condensation and it works perfectly for that.,5,Works better than I thought it would,1386460800,"12 8, 2013",0.2644

A can of ice cold soda dropped into the cup holder becomes a hot soda in just a few minutes.This insulator is incredible. The fit and finish is perfect for holding a standard can, and it adds almost no bulk to the can. The outside of the holder becomes the same temperature as the surroundings, but it's thermal mass is low enough that your fingers don't get burned picking it up.Here's the important part: The can contents stay cold. The trick I've found is to open the can and take a few swigs to the the fluid level down below the lip of the insulation. Otherwise, you're losing insulation effectiveness. A 1/3 full can will stay cool longer than a mostly full can.If you like drinking a cold canned beverage, and want the cool to stay longer, I highly recommend this insulator.Once again: THIS COOLER IS AWESOME!
