0,A22Z554ZQ8NFPC,B00003CYPK,AF Whigs,"[0, 0]","I bought this for my 8 year old son last year for his birthday, and it's been a ton of fun. First, I had my first trac ball set in the early to mid 80s so I never experienced the styrofoam balls some are discussing. So, while the balls from my old set looked very similar - textured, hollow yellow plastic - they weighed quite a bit less than these modern versions.The hardest part to get across to my kids is that you need to be pretty agressive in putting spin on the ball in order for it to curve or float. But my kids love it and I still find it a ton of fun. THe quality seems pretty much the same as the old set, which is nice to see. The raquets are plastic and it would be pretty easy to break them if you don't take care of them.On a side note: this goes back a few years, but did any other Trac Ball fans notice a raquet (painted silver) in The Phantom Menace - hanging in the shop on Tattooine where Anakin worked? I think that says something about the thought and imagination that went into TPM, but I'll leave it at that.",5,"A bit different from the old days, but still great",1341792000,"07 9, 2012",0.2972

2,A18YMFFJW974QS,B00003CYPK,CKE,"[5, 6]","Trac Ball is just as much fun today as you remember it as a kid.While growing up my friends and I developed dozens of Trac Ball related games. Some were like LaCrosse while others were like a stationary version of Hockey (two people and two goals). We developed new techniques for putting spin on the ball and created ball flights that seemed to defy the laws of physics.It is now 20 years later and I have found that my wife and I still enjoy Trac Ball as a way to get some exercise. Unlike baseball or football it is easy to play catch with Trac Ball and not worry about giving your significant other a black eye!Pros -- Easy to learn- Maintains its fun by the number of ways you can learn to curve the ball.- Very easy to invent games- Safe - the ball is lightweight plastic- Fun for all ages - I have been playing since I was about 5 years old- Everything is plastic so it is completely water proof... fun for the beach, unless the ball floats away in the water.Final tally - 5 stars",5,One of the best backyard games ever invented,1226188800,"11 9, 2008",0.7564

4,A2NZVTTHAR94IK,B00003CYPK,Duncan Idaho Spend time with your kids. It ...,"[0, 0]","I had this set as a kid and loved it. Once I had children old enough, I wanted to purchase a set for them to play with. I am so glad I did. It has been a blast teaching them how to curve the ball and how to throw in general. We can play for hours. They are great for park outings with your family or with any group you may belong to. We take them to our scout picnics and this is always a hit. We have 3 sets so there are plenty to go around. It does take a little bit of practice to get used to it, but once you have it you are in for a great time. Just be patient and take the time to try it out before you get frustrated. If you have a family get this. It is so nice to have stuff like this to do rather than be stuck inside with the electronics that do not allow for interaction.HAVE FUN!!!",5,Your Family Will Love This!,1347494400,"09 13, 2012",0.2757

6,A3IGETH1M17L0W,B00003CYPK,Jack,"[0, 0]","This is a simple, but fun, game. It's also very durable. We bought a similar-looking game (not Wham-o brand) from the 99 cent store and it literally lasted about 30 minutes before both rackets and the ball were all cracked/broke. So far we haven't had that problem with this Wham-o one.",5,Fun and durable,1376870400,"08 19, 2013",0.2435
