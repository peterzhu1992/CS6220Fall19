I'm not sure how to fix the problem!",3,Coghlans camping lantern -,1363305600,"03 15, 2013",-0.6572
2,A1WCUXLNUGF2GA,B00006F7BS,MA,"[2, 2]",Great for an emergency backup light. The only problem is if it's stored in exstream heat the candle will deform.,5,Great stand by light,1355875200,"12 19, 2012",-0.0203

One of them had a broken globe, so I'll have to resend it out for another one. These were supposed to be stocking stuffers, but I don't give people stuff I don't recommend myself. The ones I was sent were gold in color and they don't even look like a &#34;Coleman&#34; lantern (Like the one in the picture)",1,What is pictured is not what you get...,1387843200,"12 24, 2013",-0.3243
5,A3K5BREMWEULEE,B00006F7BS,Some Guy,"[3, 3]",I got 2 to put citronella tea-lights in them and hang one at each of the ends on my hammock. They're not too bright but it beats total darkness and lets you easily find your camp in the night. I carry one with me and leave one on the hammock when I'm moving about. They have handles but I like to tie a short bit of para-cord to give it more hanging length as well as a way to tie to things.,5,Nice Tea Light Lanterns,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",0.1298
