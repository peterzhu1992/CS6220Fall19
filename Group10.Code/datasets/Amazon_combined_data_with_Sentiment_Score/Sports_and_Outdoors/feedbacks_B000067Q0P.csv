I read the assembly directions, which said you need 3 people, but a woman said in her review that she assembled her trampoline alone...props to her cause I tried and nothing...absolutely no movement whatsoever. I took it to work and 3 guys assembled it very easily, but used their combined strength to make the pieces go together and open. The smell is obnoxious, which I hope will dissipate over time.

Good: has 5 legs, elastic bands instead of metal springs, quiet bouncing, affordable, the size is suitable for kids, and indoor use. Bad: the joints in the rim could be more rigid, the rim changes shape, making the legs point in odd inward and outward directions. The legs have some risk of caving in, hence my recommendation is for kids only. A single person can assemble the trampoline, but once going past 120 degre angle towards 180 degree, there is no turning back, you have to finish the job in one sitting, or the rim will forcefully whack you in the face if you try to bail out.

It is built like a battleship, but assembly is non-trivial -- you need at least two adults (the instructions recommend three) to fight against the tension to pop everything in place. No big deal, but you are not going to put this together by yourself -- you can hurt yourself if something pops back due to the high tensions involved. The instruction book could use larger and clearer pictures. The legs screw on, and one of the legs in mine was slightly out-of-round, making for some stiff turning, but I got it on. There is an 800 number to call the manufacturer for any problems. I didn't need to call.

As it is, we have to keep it in the garage and either use it outside or bring it in an jump away until the smell gets too overpowering.The other negatives are six legs that all seem to point in different directions and the lack of any workouts. The leg thing makes the thing look very unstable. It isn't (see below) but it sure looks that way. The missing workouts isn't a big deal, especially since none were promised in the listing. However, would it have been *that* hard to toss in a couple short lists of various activities that provide the high intensity, low impact workout which is promised on the box.On the plus side is easy assembly and solid construction. It is easy to put together if you follow the instructions. Unfortunately I ran into needless delays while I was putting it together. I tried for about five minutes, on my own, to fit the ring together. I finally got frustrated, read the two sentences that explained how, and had it done in under a minute. Then I put the six legs on but couldn't fit the cushion around the frame. After a few minutes I broke down and read the one sentence from the instructions that explained how the cushion should go on before the legs. A few minutes later it was fully assembled. I guess there's blame enough to go around.As for solid construction, it just is. The ring and legs are heavy steel tubing and the mat is heavy PVC. I expect this will last a very long time; far longer than the tramp's that rely on a bungee cord to provide the bounce.If only the smell would go away.",3,This thing stinks,1303689600,"04 25, 2011",Bob Tobias Robert Tobias,-0.0517

8,ACY9QYNDFLVBI,B000067Q0P,"[1, 1]","I bought this trampoline for my kids to jump on when they are going crazy in the house but it's not nice enough to go outside. For that purpose it works well. It's not the perfect trampoline but I'm glad I purchased it. The main difference between this and other trampolines is that this is based on rubber bands (wide, strong ones) instead of springs.The main things I like about this:===========================* Build quality was a little surprisingly good. Everything seems pretty sturdy.* This is not just quiet, it's silent. It makes no noise whatsoever while my kids jump on it. I was not looking forward to hearing squeaky springs all the time while my kids jump. So nice to have some peace and quiet.* Assembly was pretty quick and easy. There is one step where it is nice/necessary to have someone else hold one side while you do the other. The tension is a little scary at that point but then it pops into place and it's done. I also messed it up because I put too many bands between two of the legs (make sure there are 5 bands between each pair of legs before the last stage in frame assembly). I threaded a rope under and pulled and was able to get it over.* This trampoline is very lightweight. Easy to move around. I would have liked some fold-in legs or something. These legs screw in but you can't have everything.Things I don't like:===============* It's not very bouncy. That's my main issue with it. I'm quite certain that spring-based trampolines are bouncier. Not a problem because it's just for burning little kids' energy but I was expecting something a little more elevating. Just be aware that this trampoline has a bit of a tendency to suck your bounce. Probably that's good for working out.* This trampoline has a maximum weight of 200 pounds. I weigh 180ish so I'm under but I still pretty much leave this to my kids. Not so much for big people. If you are a little 115 pound woman (or you want it for kids) this is a great trampoline. A burly 6 foot tall man, not so much.* When it's on the floor it's fine and flat. But when you put it up it changes from a ring to kind of a saddle shape. It easy twists back to the way you want it. Just be aware of that tendency. It's not a problem once you know about it.* This trampoline stinks to high heaven. There's some kind of really stinky lubricant in it. When I first opened it up I couldn't keep it in the house for a couple of days because of the smell. It has been getting better every day but I've had it two weeks and there's still some stank. A temporary issue but one to be aware of. The first few days of use you will need noseplugs.",4,Good trampoline but not that bouncy,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",G. Farnsworth,0.1296
9,A8C6QTKFQSF37,B000067Q0P,"[0, 0]",it only took two of us to get it together. The first time it was warped after we put it together so we took it apart and did it again. On the second try it was fine. Not sure what the issue was. Went together pretty easily....smells something fierce of gasoline which is annoying. It's really just the blue rubber/plastic/foam that goes around the edge that stinks. The entire room where the trampoline is smells of it....hopefully it will be gone in a few more days as it off gasses.

10,AZMY6E8B52L2T,B000067Q0P,"[2, 2]","The Good:Price: Priced cheaper than comparative models.Weight: The unit is pretty light and easy to move around. I have no issue having this hang from a hook in the wall to keep it out of the way when not in use.Neutral:Assembly: The unit goes together somewhat easily. Package included 2 bolts and washers with a wrench, six legs and the blue outer cover used to conceal the elastic bands. The mat and four frame polls are partial assembled out of the box. I was able to get the unit assembled by myself; however with the tension it may be necessary for some to have additional assistance. I was able to assemble the trampoline in about 5-10 mins.Smell: I didn't see any other reviews mention it but my unit had a strong plastic odor. If you plan to keep this in a central living area or a bedroom you may have to have it air out because after weeks into owning it, the smell finally dissipated enough to keep it inside.The Bad:Design: I can't figure out if this is just an issue that affects some or if it's related to getting the elastic bands lined up properly, but the frame on my unit twists. This only happens if the unit is lifted or moved, but if you set it down and jump a couple times, the frame evens out. You can tell the frame is not set right when the legs are pointed really far in or out. I check all the connections and tightened the bolts but still it tends to twist. The frame is 4 parts to a circle. Two of the parts connect by inserting a smooth crimped metal piece into a hole. The other two connections are bolted. I think the issue is the smooth crimped parts are not tight enough to hold the unit in flat position and the tension of the bands can cause the unit to get off centered. I posted some pictures to the product image gallery to show these different type of connections. Even though the unit does this, I have been able each time to straighten it out enough to use it and it works great. I have no concerns about any safety issues resulting from this problem.Overall, for the price, I got exactly what I wanted and expected to get. I'm only marginally disappointed with the issues I have had with the unit. I have no intention of returning my unit or getting a replacement because most reviews point to the problem eventually turning up, for those reviewers who have updated their reviews. After pulling out the legs and leveling the unit, it becomes a non-issue during use.",4,I Got What I Paid For...,1354233600,"11 30, 2012",JP J.P.,0.0244
11,A68KJIH3C8XGN,B000067Q0P,"[0, 0]",Very low impact on joints. I jog in place on it and bounce as well. It helps with balance by causing the brain to constantly adjust in keeping balance.

12,A1DDZTDK7NKWQX,B000067Q0P,"[0, 0]","This tramp is not a very high-quality product, but given the price I paid on Amazon Prime, on the order of thirty dollars with shipping, it WAS a good value.Lots of people talking about how hard an install it was. I agree, it was tricky, but if you couldn't do this, then you simply are not handy. The manual calls for three people to build it. Ridiculous! I did it while watching in one episode of The Daily Show, and I skipped the commercials. That's 22 minutes, and I'm just a handy, average strength, healthy man. Some force is required, but two feet and two hands did the trick.I am 210 lb, and sadly, am too heavy to get bounce on this. It seems to be good for 160lb or less.But the tramp, once assembled and all 2 bolts tightened, does not hold the disk form well. It occasionally warps when the kids jump on it or move it. Not much, but enough to make the legs a little wonky. It still works, but that's why I say the quality just isn't top notch.For the price, I still recommend it as a good value.",4,"Not Great, But Worth The Money",1336694400,"05 11, 2012",Kerton,0.177
13,A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B000067Q0P,"[331, 337]","UPDATE 11-12: The trampoline still has a solid base and solid legs. We take it out periodically and jump away. The blue outer vinyl band looks a little worse each time but it is almost 10 years old. The fact that the basic trampoline structure is as solid and sturdy as the first time we used it is a testament to the durability.***************************UPDATE 9-09: My son is now 10 and I have a 5 yr-old daughter. This trampoline has lasted through tons of use. We continue to find fun things to do with it. We have used it on the end of a dock to jump into water. It has been part of 'obstacle' courses. It is great for exercise and balance. The only thing that has given a little is the blue outer ring. Not a big issue but with multiple children using it for over 6 years, there are some tears to the vinyl. Nothing a little duct tape won't fix! The trampoline base has no signs or wear or deterioration and the legs are solid and straight.***************************I bought this for my just-turned four-year-old son who, like most boys, loves to jump on the sofa, the bed and anything that looks a little bouncy.It was easy to set up (it says you need three adults but my husband and I did it easily). It appears well crafted and durable -- time will tell.The directions say that it is good for up to 200 lbs.My 37 lb son had a lot of fun jumping right away, although he did not jump as high as one thinks of with a trampoline. But for a small, indoor trampoline, I don't think you want your children flying too high. I also think that as his weight and ability increase, he will get more bounce out of it.My biggest reasons for buying it are the safety (no springs, padded edge) and the size. I can easily remove the feet and slip it under a bed.On a really hot day, we can still burn off extra energy inside.We put a chair at the edge (turned around) and he then had a handle to hold while jumping.Safety is a big factor with any toy that increases the movement of your child so we went over all the safety rules before he took one step on. I think that any toy is as safe as its surroundings, supervision and appropriate use.We also have the Jump-o-lene (an inflatable jumping toy). Although we enjoy that as well, it takes up a lot of room and requires a lot of push to gain any bounce. I am hoping this is the next step up in strengthening leg muscles and increasing one, and two footed coordination.",5,Great starter trampoline,1057363200,"07 5, 2003",K. Groh,0.2611

A great thing about it is how quiet it is compared to my old one due to it using nylon/elastic bands around the frame instead of springs. This alone gives it at least three stars in my view. Assembly wasn't too bad either.My main problem with it is the size. It is advertised as being 38 inches and that is simply not the case. The interior dimension of the surface on which you would jump is 31 1/2 inches in diameter. Even the exterior dimension is less than 38 inches (not that it matters.
