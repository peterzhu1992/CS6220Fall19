I generally bass fish in 20 ft of water.For night fishing I use the line that shows on black light. For day fishing I use the crystal line.I caught a 5 lb smallmouth on Dale Hollow with the 8 pound line. Last year using another line we broke off on several fish. This year I took my own gear and used the Crystal 8 lb line, and had no fear of the line breaking and that confidence was wonderful.This line casts extemelly well. Just remeber this is one strong line. Some buy 20 pound line or higher and that is a huge mistake as the line does not cast as well and is way too powerful for normal bass fishing.With 8-10 pound line when you get hung you are pretty much hung as the line is so strong.I will forever use this line and not waste time trying any other line.",5,Fireline,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",0.3476
1,ANXE2VV6AQ0GU,B00004T69F,Chris,"[4, 4]","Both my girlfriend and I use Fireline on our weekly outing to the Sacramento River. We use the 8lb. Fireline paired up with the 6lb. P-Line CFX fluorocarbon for a leader. This past week she caught a 20 pound king salmon with a 1/2oz. Kastmaster and the setup held up without a problem for nearly 30 minutes (the time it took to bring the fish in). The fish was released being it was out of season, but this line will forever be kept on our reels. I've snagged my treble hooked lures many times and been able to pull it free, only to find out the hook is bent downward, and that's with 8lb. Fireline. If it's strong enough to bend a hook before the line breaks, it's strong enough to bring in nice sized fish. We've tried PowerPro and find the stuff to be junk. As others have noted, the stuff breaks when you least expect it. Even a normal cast and your lure will fly into oblivion while you stand there with an O-face and think wtf! Also, wind knots seem to be much more prominent with that stuff. Nothing good ever came out of that line for us. Fireline is the braid of choice for us and with a proper leader, it can make a deadly setup.",5,Fireline continues to be the best...,1363132800,"03 13, 2013",0.0681
2,A1ZPY91VE3IDN1,B00004T69F,JO,"[0, 0]","I haven't used theBerkley Fireline 125-Yard Fishing Linein the 6/2-Pound Smoke for fishing yet, but it is the best for beading projects, particularly those with faceted beads like crystals or stones. I double the line and first wipe it through a paper towel, then run it through beeswax after threading my needle. I never knot this superline when beading, but use silk or nylon thread in those cases. Amazon sells this product for much less than any other source I've found. I also can recommend theBerkley Hot Line Cutterwhich does an outstanding job of cutting and melting the fireline when a project is completed.",5,Multipurpose line for beading and fishing,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",0.3546
3,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B00004T69F,Leanne,"[2, 2]","I've been using Fireline in my beading projects for about eight years, and it works great for when you're using Swarovski crystals or beads that have sharp edges.The 6-pound count is nice for beads that are heavier and projects that have more weight to them.You just need to be really careful not to knot your projects; quite a few beading instructors have been warning that knots will break with this, and I've seen it happen when they demonstrate it.The smoke color will leave a grey residue on your fingers, but I rub it through a piece of Kleenex to take it off before I wax my thread, and have no problems.I was so happy to find this on Amazon since it's much cheaper to buy it here than from a beading store or beading website!",5,"Not just for fishing -- this is great for beaders, too!",1369180800,"05 22, 2013",0.8847
4,A3QB42QA8DCJ8,B00004T69F,Nicholas,"[0, 0]","This line is alright.. I find it more manageable than traditional braid because it is a little more stiff, but the uneven texture takes some getting used to. The color comes off all over your hands pretty easily, so you end up with a lighter color line after some use, though that is pretty normal with braided line variants. After some abrasion i did have it snap on a cast once, very unexpected. I used this 14lb test on bait-casters, casts pretty well.",3,sheds color,1376611200,"08 16, 2013",0.346

What's up with that? When did fishing become a techno-weenie adventure?Not at all what I wanted.I'm dropping the staars for a very confusing product description. I can't use it on my reels, and can't rate it as a fishing line, but the guy I gave it to was very happy to get it for salmon fishing.",2,Could it be any harder to determine line strength?,1352160000,"11 6, 2012",0.0102
